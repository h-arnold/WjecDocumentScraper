INTRODUCTION

1.1  Aims

The GCSE Design and Technology qualification supports learners to:
•  understand the modern technologies, materials and practices used to create

products and solutions that meet the needs and wants of users

•  analyse and be inspired by existing products that inform the design and
production of practical solutions which target end users and markets
recognise the underlying technical principle, skills and knowledge that apply in
chosen design pathways

•

•  appreciate the importance of creativity, craftsmanship and innovation, applied

throughout iterative design practices, in the design and creation of new products
•  appreciate the factors that affect the needs and wants of users and how iterative

design processes focus on meeting these to produce effective products

•  describe ways in which design outcomes can have environmental and societal

impacts that can be local, national and international

•  use their knowledge, skills and understanding to influence their own decision

when making and evaluating a product or prototype.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales’ Approval Criteria.

1.2  Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Design and Technology qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for
Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to
make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification.
Central to this design are the principles of progression, along with the statements of
what matters and those specific skills and concepts outlined in the Designing your
Curriculum section of the Science and Technology Area of Learning and Experiences

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to
embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral
skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple
mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for
Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for
integrating the learning experiences noted on page 42. The Guidance for Teaching
will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd 2025.

GCSE DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY 6

The GCSE Design and Technology qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales
by:
•  Supporting the statements of what matters by giving learners the opportunity to:
•  be curious and search for answers to understand and predict phenomena
•  make informed decisions that affect our environment and well-being
•  consider the impact of their actions and of technological developments
•  apply their experiences, skills and knowledge to design and shape innovative

engineered solutions

•  understand and control the interactions between material, structures,

components and users

•  become enterprising problem solvers
•  make informed decisions about the future development and application of

technology.

•  Supporting the principles of progression by encouraging learners to:

•

increase their breadth and depth of knowledge by exploring and experiencing
increasingly complex ideas and concepts

•  deepen their understanding of ideas, disciplines and experience
•  develop their ability to investigate, explore, problem-solve and design both in

the physical and digital environments

•  make connections and transfer their learning into new contexts.

•  Supporting the subject specific considerations for Design and Technology by

giving learners the opportunity to consider:
•  a range of practical techniques (including taking measurements and making

•

observations)
their conceptual and procedural knowledge of a range of materials and
techniques through practical experiences to inform their design thinking
iterative design processes, including continual testing and evaluating

•
•  how to create prototypes that are fit for purpose.

1.3  Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is
designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the
conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages
3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills
and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares
learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation
for the study of Design and Technology at either AS or A level. In addition, the
specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for
learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

1.4  Guided learning hours

GCSE Design and Technology has been designed to be delivered within 120 – 140
guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year
programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

GCSE DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY 7

1.5  Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our
language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect
and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and
adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising
that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to
ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres
of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always
be on the website.

1.6  Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic,
religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible,
features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access
and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual
orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to
enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills
without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the
following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access
Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This
document is available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of
provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete
barrier to any part of the assessment.

Opportunities for integration of learning experiences

GCSE Design and Technology generates opportunities for the following learning
experiences to be developed (experiences will not be directly assessed):

•  engage with the work of designers to develop an appreciation of how design thinking is

applied and of the diverse range of careers and occupations that use it

•  engage with local developments, projects and initiatives that demonstrate how design
thinking is applied and of the diverse range of careers and occupations that use it
•  explore the ways in which design thinking has been used to solve problems nationally

and across the world

•  collaborate with others to understand the role that feedback can play in strengthening
and testing design thinking, and of how teams can work together to solve complex
problems

•  experiment with materials in safe and controlled environments to understand their

properties and possibilities

•  gain awareness and appreciation of some of the different careers and work-related areas

that draw upon design and technology.

Further amplification of the opportunities to develop cross-cutting themes, cross-curricular
skills and integral skills can be found in Appendix A. The Guidance for Teaching will include
further information on the opportunities provided by the qualification for teachers/centres to
integrate these learning experiences into delivery.

3.2  Arrangements for non-examination assessment

Unit 2: Design Project

Learners must select the same design pathway as they selected for Unit 1: Design
and Technology within the 21st Century. The three available pathways are:
•  Engineering Design
•  Fashion and Textiles
•  Product Design.

Learners are required to complete a sustained design and make task, based on a
contextual challenge set by WJEC, assessing learners’ ability to:
•
•  design and make prototypes and evaluate their fitness for purpose.

identify, investigate, analyse and outline design possibilities

Learners may complete the unit at any time during the GCSE course once the
contextual challenges are released on 1 April on Portal. However, centres should
ensure that assessment is completed only when learners have undertaken the
necessary teaching and learning and developed the required skills and knowledge.

The suggested assessment duration is approximately 40 hours.

The assessment contributes to 70% of the overall qualification and will be marked out
of a total of 100 marks.

This unit will be assessed by the centre and externally moderated by WJEC.

4  MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's
regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in
the preparation of work for GCSE Design and Technology.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our Guide to preventing, reporting and
investigating malpractice.

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC
(malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or
disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet Suspected
Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

5.1  Making entries

This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the
course. Non-examination assessed units can be completed earlier in the course but
must be submitted at the end of the course.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series until the end of the
life of this specification. Summer 2028 will be the first assessment opportunity.

A qualification may be taken more than once. Candidates must resit all examination
units in the same series.

Learners who resit examination units can carry forward the marks they received for
non-examination assessed units from the first time they attempted the qualification.

Marks for non-examination assessment (NEA) may be carried forward for the life of
the specification. If a candidate resits an NEA unit (rather than carrying forward the
previous NEA mark), it is the new mark that will count towards the overall grade,
even if it is lower than a previous attempt (unless the mark is absent).
