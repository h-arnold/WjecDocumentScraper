## GCSE DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY

## 1 INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Aims

The GCSE Design and Technology qualification supports learners to:

- understand the modern technologies, materials and practices used to create products and solutions that meet the needs and wants of users
- analyse and be inspired by existing products that inform the design and production of practical solutions which target end users and markets
- recognise the underlying technical principle, skills and knowledge that apply in chosen design pathways
- appreciate the importance of creativity, craftsmanship and innovation, applied throughout iterative design practices, in the design and creation of new products
- appreciate the factors that affect the needs and wants of users and how iterative design processes focus on meeting these to produce effective products
- describe ways in which design outcomes can have environmental and societal impacts that can be local, national and international
- use their knowledge, skills and understanding to influence their own decision when making and evaluating a product or prototype.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales' Approval Criteria.

## 1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Design and Technology qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the principles of progression, along with the statements of what matters and those specific skills and concepts outlined in the Designing your Curriculum section of the Science and Technology Area of Learning and Experiences

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted on page 42. The Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.



{7}------------------------------------------------



The GCSE Design and Technology qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:

- Supporting the statements of what matters by giving learners the opportunity to:
- be curious and search for answers to understand and predict phenomena
- make informed decisions that affect our environment and well-being
- consider the impact of their actions and of technological developments
- apply their experiences, skills and knowledge to design and shape innovative engineered solutions
- understand and control the interactions between material, structures, components and users
- become enterprising problem solvers
- make informed decisions about the future development and application of technology.
- Supporting the principles of progression by encouraging learners to:
- increase their breadth and depth of knowledge by exploring and experiencing increasingly complex ideas and concepts
- deepen their understanding of ideas, disciplines and experience
- develop their ability to investigate, explore, problem-solve and design both in the physical and digital environments
- make connections and transfer their learning into new contexts.
- Supporting the subject specific considerations for Design and Technology by giving learners the opportunity to consider:
- a range of practical techniques (including taking measurements and making observations)
- their conceptual and procedural knowledge of a range of materials and techniques through practical experiences to inform their design thinking

•

iterative design processes, including continual testing and evaluating

- how to create prototypes that are fit for purpose.

## 1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 -14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of Design and Technology at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

## 1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE Design and Technology has been designed to be delivered within 120 -140 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.



{8}------------------------------------------------



## 1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

## 1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.



{9}------------------------------------------------



## 2 SUBJECT CONTENT

The GCSE Design and Technology qualification is available in the following pathways:

- Engineering Design
- Fashion and Textiles
- Product Design.

Learners are required to study one of these three pathways.

Both Unit 1: Design and Technology in the 21 st  Century and Unit 2: Desing Project consist of:

- core knowledge and information that all learners are required to study to ensure they have a broad knowledge and understanding of design and technology
- in-depth content that is specific to learners' chosen pathway .

## How to read the amplification

The amplification provided in the right-hand column , titled 'Further Information' uses the following five stems:

- 'Learners should know' is used when learners are required to demonstrate basic knowledge and understanding.
- 'Learners should be able to' is used when learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques.
- 'Learners should understand' is used when learners are required to demonstrate greater depth of knowledge and understanding, application of knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and analysis and evaluation of information for a given purpose.
- 'Learners should be aware of' is used when learners do not need to understand all aspects of the specified content in detail. Teachers should refer to Guidance for Teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and breadth to which this content should be taught.
- 'Learners are required to' is used to show the requirements of individual units.

The use of the word ' including ' indicates that the specified content must be taught and could be subject to assessment.

The use of the words 'for example' or 'such as' indicates that the specified content is for guidance only, and alternative examples could be chosen.

## Opportunities for integration of learning experiences

GCSE Design and Technology generates opportunities for the following learning experiences to be developed (experiences will not be directly assessed):

- engage with the work of designers to develop an appreciation of how design thinking is applied and of the diverse range of careers and occupations that use it
- engage with local developments, projects and initiatives that demonstrate how design thinking is applied and of the diverse range of careers and occupations that use it
- explore the ways in which design thinking has been used to solve problems nationally and across the world
- collaborate with others to understand the role that feedback can play in strengthening and testing design thinking, and of how teams can work together to solve complex problems
- experiment with materials in safe and controlled environments to understand their properties and possibilities
- gain awareness and appreciation of some of the different careers and work-related areas that draw upon design and technology.

Further amplification of the opportunities to develop cross-cutting themes, cross-curricular skills and integral skills can be found in Appendix A. The Guidance for Teaching will include further information on the opportunities provided by the qualification for teachers/centres to integrate these learning experiences into delivery.



{44}------------------------------------------------



## 3 ASSESSMENT

The Assessment Pack will include all detailed information relating to assessment.

## 3.1 Assessment Objectives and Weightings

Below are the assessment objectives for this specification. Learners must:

## AO1

Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the principles, materials, tools and techniques used in design and technology.

## AO2

Apply knowledge and understanding of the principles, materials, tools and techniques used in design and technology.

## AO3

Develop designs and tangible products.

## AO4

Analyse and evaluate products and solutions in a range of design and technology contexts.

The table below shows the weighting of each assessment objective for each unit and for the qualification as a whole.

|                   | AO1   | AO2   | AO3   | AO4   | Total   |
|-------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Unit 1            | 15%   | 15%   | -     | -     | 30%     |
| Unit 2            | -     | 15%   | 35%   | 20%   | 70%     |
| Overall weighting | 15%   | 30%   | 35%   | 20%   | 100%    |



{45}------------------------------------------------



## 3.2 Arrangements for non-examination assessment

## Unit 2: Design Project

Learners must select the same design pathway as they selected for Unit 1: Design and Technology within the 21 st  Century. The three available pathways are:

- Engineering Design
- Fashion and Textiles
- Product Design.

Learners are required to complete a sustained design and make task, based on a contextual challenge set by WJEC, assessing learners' ability to:

- identify, investigate, analyse and outline design possibilities
- design and make prototypes and evaluate their fitness for purpose.

Learners may complete the unit at any time during the GCSE course once the contextual challenges are released on 1 April on Portal. However, centres should ensure that assessment is completed only when learners have undertaken the necessary teaching and learning and developed the required skills and knowledge.

The suggested assessment duration is approximately 40 hours.

The assessment contributes to 70% of the overall qualification and will be marked out of a total of 100 marks.

This unit will be assessed by the centre and externally moderated by WJEC.



{46}------------------------------------------------



## 4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for GCSE Design and Technology.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our Guide to preventing, reporting and investigating malpractice.

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC (malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet Suspected Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.



{47}------------------------------------------------



## 5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

## 5.1 Making entries

This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the course. Non-examination assessed units can be completed earlier in the course but must be submitted at the end of the course.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series until the end of the life of this specification. Summer 2028 will be the first assessment opportunity.

A qualification may be taken more than once. Candidates must resit all examination units in the same series.

Learners who resit examination units can carry forward the marks they received for non-examination assessed units from the first time they attempted the qualification.

Marks for non-examination assessment (NEA) may be carried forward for the life of the specification. If a candidate resits an NEA unit (rather than carrying forward the previous NEA mark), it is the new mark that will count towards the overall grade, even if it is lower than a previous attempt (unless the mark is absent).

The entry codes appear below:

|                                                        | Entry code     | Entry code   |
|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|
|                                                        | English medium | Welsh medium |
| WJEC GCSE Design and Technology (Engineering Design)   | 3481QS         | 3481CS       |
| WJEC GCSE Design and Technology (Fashion and Textiles) | 3482QS         | 3482CS       |
| WJEC GCSE Design and Technology (Product Design)       | 3483QS         | 3483CS       |

The current edition of our Entry Procedures and Coding Information gives up-to-date entry procedures.



{48}------------------------------------------------



## 5.2 Grading, awarding and reporting

GCSE qualifications are reported on an eight point scale from A*-G, where A* is the highest grade. Results not attaining the minimum standard for the award will be reported as U (unclassified).
