## Overview of Unit 2

## Key Business Considerations

Assessment Type: Non-examination assessment 15% of qualification 48 marks

The purpose of this unit is to introduce learners to business and society. Learners will apply their knowledge and understanding in the context of one of the key themes that are relevant to the contemporary business environment:

- business ethics
- business and the environment
- business and technology.

The knowledge and understanding gained from Unit 1 will allow learners to fully explore these key themes in the context of real business.

Through this unit learners will be able to develop:

- enquiry and investigation skills
- the ability to present business data
- the ability to analyse and evaluate business data.

The unit will be based on the following concepts:

- business and society
- business fundamentals
- change
- cynefin
- economies
- enquiry and investigation
- ethics
- innovation
- opportunities and challenges
- sustainability.

For this assessment learners are required to investigate a business that operates in their locality. The business they investigate can be a local scale business only operating in the locality or a national or global business that has a presence in the locality.

Learners will be required to undertake research on their chosen business and to use their research findings to produce a report. Part A of the report will be compulsory, but for part B WJEC will select two themes from the specification content (Business ethics, Business and the environment and Business and Technology) and centres and/or learners will choose one of the selected themes.

The assignment, featuring the two selected themes and associated tasks, will be released during the first week of September for assessment for that academic year and will change annually. The themes are published in the Assessment Pack for Unit 2 for five years. This will be updated to ensure there are always five years' worth of themes to allow for forward planning. Centres have the flexibility to decide when, during the assessment year, learners undertake the assignment. However, it is important that centres select the topic from the year that they plan to submit the work for marking as this may be different to the year that the candidates undertake the assessment.

| 2.1.1 The nature of society and business | Learners should be aware of the: • complex, pluralistic and diverse nature of society • Business Wales Equality Pledge. Learners should understand: • the relationship between business and society • the importance of diversity for businesses • contributions to business from a range of different groups within society, including those of Black, Asian, and minority ethnic communities and individuals • contributions to business from those traditionally underrepresented in business including women, disabled people and those who are socio-economically disadvantaged. | Learners need to be given clear definitions and meanings of what is meant by complex, pluralistic and diverse in terms of society. Teachers will need explain that the Equality Pledge helps Welsh businesses take pro-active steps towards creating an inclusive, fair and diverse workplace, demonstrating their commitment to their employees and the wider community, while offering accessible products and services to all. (More information on the Business Wales Equality Pledge can be found here: • https://businesswales.gov.wales/topics-and-guidance/sustainability- and-social-responsibility/equality-pledge ) Learners could be challenged to see what they understand by the terms, inclusive, fair and diverse. Do they think that their local community is representative of this. Why/why not? Businesses and society are deeply intertwined, with each influencing the other in various ways. A collaborative approach that considers both business goals and societal needs can lead to sustainable growth and a better quality of life for all. Learners can investigate local businesses and summarise the relationship between the business and the local community. Having a diverse and multicultural workplace brings several advantages. Since today's world is increasingly more globalised and interconnected, workplaces should take advantage of the diverse range of skills individuals from different backgrounds and languages can bring. |



{10}------------------------------------------------



| Therefore, a diverse and multicultural workplace brings several advantages such as enhanced innovation, improved decision-making, better performance, attracting top talent, wider market reach, employee satisfaction/retention and social responsibility. Learners could work through each of these to ensure that they understand what they mean. They could then 'diamond 9' them as to which they believe is the most beneficial advantage to both business and society, and why. Learners could research some of the business case studies on Success stories | Business Wales (gov.wales) and describe how their chosen business is representative of adhering to the Business Wales Equality Pledge and how they are helping to better society. The contributions of Black, Asian, and minority ethnic communities to business are significant and multifaceted. Many individuals from diverse backgrounds have founded successful businesses that bring unique products, services, and cultural perspectives to the market. Their entrepreneurial spirit drives innovation, often filling gaps in the marketplace. Teachers and learners could explore the following websites to see what jobs are available that positively target those from diverse ethnic communities: • https://bmejobs.co.uk/ • https://www.bame-jobs.co.uk/bame-network/ • https://www.aspiringtoinclude.com/jobseekers/bame/ • Entrepreneurship without borders: 10 global Welsh entrepreneurs | GlobalWelsh • Celebrating six BAME businesswomen and trailblazers making their mark in Wales - alt.cardiff (cardiffjournalism.co.uk) Teachers and learners could use these websites to highlight some   |

| 2.1.2 The impact of business on society | Learners should understand: • the impact of business activity on society, such as: • career opportunities and employment • meeting consumer needs and wants • prosperity and standards of living • economic growth • wealth, wages and salaries • tax contribution • innovation and growth in technology • culture. Learners should be aware of the impact business has on society from a local, national and global perspective. | Many of the key terms in this section have been covered in Unit 1. Some new ones have been introduced such as economic growth, wealth, wages and salaries, tax contribution and culture. Teachers will need to explain these key terms and test understanding in the form of quizzes, multiple choice questions, etc. The teacher could then delve down into each impact, such as; • For career opportunities and employment, the teacher could explain how businesses create jobs, which provide people with employment. This gives people the chance to build their skills, pursue careers, and earn money. This will also impact on prosperity, economic growth, wealth, wages and salaries and tax contribution. To make this relevant to the learners, they could be asked what jobs they are interested in and explain how various businesses in different industries offer those jobs. Discussions about part-time jobs or careers they might consider in the future could also be had. Learners could then research a business or industry they're interested in and explore the kinds of jobs available, including salaries, required qualifications, and career paths. • Learners could research the impact of a local business closure in their local area and discuss the impact of this on the various stakeholders and then extend this to discuss stakeholders who may benefit and those who may lose out. • One approach could be to look at the ending of the coal or steel |

| manufacturing in the UK at a national level and how this has impacted those at a local level (Port Talbot). There are plenty of news articles surrounding these that could be used to research and highlight how people are concerned about their jobs, how this may limit the money being spent in the local economy, but that it has been brought about by innovation and the growth in technology. Example news articles include: • How the end of coal in the UK and closure of Port Talbot steelworks are related | Business News | Sky News • Final blast furnace is shut down for good at Tata's Port Talbot steelworks - Wales Online There have been several cases in recent years where international brands have been accused of not paying appropriate tax contributions in the UK (e.g. Starbucks/Google). Learners could be presented with this information and asked to challenge whether they think this behaviour is acceptable or not. This could be in the form of a class debate and group presentation. From an international perspective, ActionAid UK has some case studies on their website where they highlight what they are doing to try to rectify the imbalances between business and society. This could act as a gateway to the idea of whether this is good or bad behaviour in preparation for the teaching of ethics in the forthcoming lessons.   |

| 2.1.3 The impact of society on business   | Learners should understand: • the impact of society on business activity and behaviour, including: • social factors, such as: • demographics • attitudes and opinions • interests and lifestyles • social change, such as: • addressing social injustice • societal challenges. Learners should be aware of the impact society has on business from a local, national and global perspective.   | Society significantly influences business activity and behaviour through demographic shifts, changing attitudes and lifestyles, and the need to respond to social changes and challenges. Businesses that actively engage with these societal dynamics are better positioned to succeed in a rapidly evolving marketplace. Understanding and adapting to these factors not only enhances profitability but also contributes to a more equitable and sustainable society. To help the learners understand the relationship between society and business, introduce the idea that businesses don't operate in isolation but are influenced by societal trends and needs. Teachers could start with a class discussion asking learners how their daily lives interact with businesses (e.g. shopping, technology, advertising, etc). Questions should be asked such as, "Why do businesses care about what we like, where we live, or what issues we care about?" Changes in demographics, such as age, gender, race, and income levels, influence businesses to tailor their products and marketing strategies. For example, an aging population may lead companies to develop more health-oriented products. Learners could look at the holiday industry or supermarket industry to see how they target their holidays/products sold, based on age, gender, race, and income levels. Learners could explore the local community to see if there are businesses that target a particular demographic. For example, are there lots of nursery schools near schools and why might this be. This website gives some various statistics that learners could explore and discuss how this information could be useful to a business setting up in a particular area: Demography and migration in Wales (Census 2021) [HTML] | GOV.WALES   |

| In relation to attitudes and opinions there has been a shift in public attitudes towards issues such as sustainability, health, and ethical consumption, which can drive businesses to adopt eco-friendly practices and transparent supply chains. This has resulted in consumers increasing their demand for these businesses.  Learners could look to identify any local, national and global businesses who have adapted or are in the process of adapting their business practices to adhere to this new consumer attitude. This could include businesses using their loyalty schemes to ensure supporting local businesses, for example, 'Tesco Stronger Starts' is open to charities and community organisations to apply for a grant of up to £1,500. Every three months, three local good causes are selected to be in the blue token customer vote in Tesco stores throughout the UK. Another example is McDonalds letting customers redeem their points as a cash donation for their Ronald McDonald House Charities.  Businesses must adapt to evolving lifestyles and interests, such as the rise of remote work leading to increased demand for home office products and digital tools. There are businesses who have explored the possibility of a 4-day working week - the Body Coach being a big advocate of this. There has also been a recent turn around in businesses recalling employees back to the office, e.g. Amazon. This could be an opportunity to recap 1.4 Stakeholders.  Social change - addressing social injustice - corporate social responsibility (CSR):  As societal awareness of social injustices increases, businesses are increasingly expected to take active roles in addressing these issues, whether through philanthropy, equitable hiring practices, or support. Businesses that neglect social justice issues may face public backlash, negatively impacting their reputation and sales. Conversely, those that lead in social initiatives often enhance their brand image.   |

| Societal challenges - businesses must respond to societal challenges, such as economic downturns, health crises (like the COVID-19 pandemic), or climate change. This may involve changing working practices such as WFH or adopting sustainable practices. Societal challenges can spur innovation, for example, the demand for cleaner energy sources has led to the growth of green technology companies, while health crises have accelerated developments in telemedicine. Learners could research businesses on a local, national and global scale to see how they are/have responded to societal challenges.   |

| 2.2.1 Business enquiry and investigation skills     | Learners should be able to: • undertake primary and secondary research • collect appropriate qualitative and quantitative data • explore business data in the context of: • society • ethics • the environment • technology. | Teaching learners to effectively undertake primary and secondary research, collect qualitative and quantitative data, and explore business data within the contexts of society, ethics, the environment, and technology can be achieved through a combination of hands-on activities, theoretical understanding, and critical analysis. Whilst market research is discussed in greater detail in 3.4.1, it may be worth the teacher explaining what primary and secondary research is and the types of places that they can go to collect this information. ( They do not need to know about the advantages and disadvantages of primary and secondary market research at this stage .) BBC bitesize could be used for learners to conduct some prior reading around the topic of data. Introduce basic statistical concepts and tools (e.g. Excel, Google Sheets) to analyse numerical data. Provide datasets for learners to practice interpreting data and generating insights. For primary research methods, guide learners in designing surveys to collect quantitative data. Discuss different types of questions (open- ended vs. closed-ended) and sampling methods. Conduct workshops on how to prepare for and conduct interviews or focus groups to gather qualitative data. Teachers could also facilitate role-play interviews for learners to practice. |

Use practical exercises to find and analyse data from these sources. One activity could be to get learners to evaluate the environmental impact of a specific business or industry and propose sustainable solutions. Teachers could assign teams to conduct a research project where they must collect both qualitative and quantitative data. For instance, they could research consumer behaviour related to a local business or product. Encourage learners to conduct primary research in their local community. They could observe businesses, conduct interviews with business owners, or survey local residents about their shopping habits. Guest speakers: Invite business professionals to discuss how they incorporate ethical considerations, societal impacts, and technological advancements in their work.   |

| 2.2.2 Presenting and analysing business data | Learners should be able to: • present qualitative and quantitative data in appropriate formats • analyse and interpret business data in the context of: • society • ethics • the environment • technology. | Teaching learners how to present, analyse, and interpret qualitative and quantitative data within various contexts can be approached through a variety of methods. It may be necessary to begin with a clear distinction between qualitative and quantitative data through the use of visual aids (charts, graphs) to explain these concepts. Teachers could then lead discussions on why analysing data within the contexts of society, ethics, the environment, and technology is important. The use of real-world examples to make these connections may be beneficial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Assign learners to collect data (surveys, interviews, experiments) related to business issues. This hands-on experience reinforces learning. Learners can be taught/reminded of the different formats for data presentation (e.g. charts, tables, infographics, reports). Teachers should provide templates and examples for each format. When choosing case studies, teachers should use those that involve real businesses facing ethical dilemmas, environmental issues, or technological advancements. Learners would then analyse data and present their findings. Facilitate classroom discussions or debates on the ethical implications of business decisions based on data analysis (e.g. marketing strategies, environmental impact assessments). Provide datasets and ask learners to interpret the data in the context of a specific scenario (e.g. a business decision affecting society). Have them justify their interpretations. Statswales and ONS are websites that can be used to generate data sets. Present hypothetical business scenarios where learners must analyse data and make decisions based on ethical considerations or technological implications. If possible, invite guest speakers from various sectors (business, environmental organisations, tech companies) to discuss how they use data in their decision-making processes.   |

| 2.2.3 Evaluating business data   | Learners should be able to: • make reasoned judgements based on analysed business data • think critically about the business data • reflect on the business data collected in the context of: • society • ethics • the environment • technology.   | Provide datasets for learners to analyse, draw conclusions, and make judgments based on their findings. This could involve using Excel, Google Sheets, or specialised software to visualise and interpret data. Encourage discussions on how the data relates to ethical practices and societal impacts. Develop exercises that challenge learners to evaluate business scenarios critically. This could be done by using either hypothetical or real-life scenarios involving data that pose ethical dilemmas or societal issues, prompting learners to justify their reasoning. Conduct group work focused on ethics in business, sustainability, and the role of technology. Engage learners in discussions and activities that explore ethical dilemmas in data usage and decision-making, linking to environmental and societal impacts.   |

| 2.3.1a Ethical business behaviour | Learners should know what is meant by business ethics. Learners should understand the types of ethical issues for a business, such as: • animal rights • discrimination in the workplace • ethical marketing • social responsibility • treatment of customers • treatment of suppliers • treatment of workers • use of technology. | As an introduction to business ethics learners could watch Business Ethics | The Impact of Ethics on Business (youtube.com). As learners watch the video they could mind map what they understand by the term business ethics. Blood, Sweat and T-shirts could be used as a starting point to engage learners in a discussion about the treatment of workers. Are the learners shocked by what they see? Do they think it is acceptable? Case study material can be used to interpret and develop an argument in relation to business ethics. There are many news reports that can be used for this. For animal testing, the teacher can start with explaining how businesses use animals (e.g. in product testing, farming, or entertainment). Discuss companies that respect animal rights and those that violate them. Learners could contribute their current knowledge of those businesses who do/do not test on animals. An activity could be to show short videos about animal testing vs. cruelty-free companies. Then, have learners debate whether companies should be allowed to use animals for testing, offering both sides of the argument. A further discussion activity could be to ask, "Would you buy from a company that tests on animals? Why or why not?" |

| For discrimination in the workplace, the teacher can start with explaining what discrimination in the workplace looks like (gender, race, age, etc.). This can be supported by using real-life cases (e.g. unequal pay, lack of diversity) based on what is current in the news at the time. Working in groups, learners could be presented with a case study where an employee is discriminated against and asked to identify the problem and suggest solutions. A further discussion activity could be to ask, "Why is it important for businesses to ensure equal treatment of employees?" or "How would you feel if you were in that employee's position?". Following an explanation of ethical marketing (being honest about products, not manipulating customers), learners could be shown contrasting case studies of examples of misleading advertising or targeting vulnerable people (like children or elderly). Learners could be presented with a series of ads, some ethical and some not. They have to guess which are which and explain why. As an extension, the learners could be asked, "Have you ever seen an ad that you thought was misleading? How did it make you feel?". Identify some other ethical issues and get learners to research business behaviour towards those issues.   |

| 2.3.2a The impact of ethical or unethical business behaviour   | Learners should understand: • the advantages to a business of making ethical decisions, such as: • positive reputation and image • consumer attraction • competitive advantage • employee motivation and retention • the impact on a business of making unethical decisions, such as: • reduced sales • negative reputation and image • risk of legal or regulatory penalty • employee disengagement • societal benefits of ethical business behaviour.   | Based on discussions and work from previous lessons, learners could create a table for the main benefits and drawbacks of ethical behaviour. Learners can read and watch about how Primark and their Sustainability and Ethics Progress Report 2022/23: PRIMARK PRESENTS: How Change Looks. See if it is possible to invite a local business owner to discuss the importance of ethics in their business. Learners can ask questions about how ethical decisions have impacted their business and employee morale. If not, learners could conduct online research to identify business who implement ethical practices. An online forum could be created or class discussion where learners can discuss current events related to business ethics. Use role-playing scenarios to help learners navigate ethical dilemmas they might face in a business setting. These scenarios could be created with learners asked to try generating solutions to the dilemmas identified. The teacher could lead a discussion on how ethical business behaviour contributes positively to society. Discussion points could include community investment and support (e.g. local charities, fair wages); environmental sustainability and protection; trust and cooperation within the business ecosystem. Learners could record these ideas in the form of mind maps. They could be shown a short video that highlights businesses making a positive impact through ethical decisions (e.g. corporate social responsibility initiatives). They could then be asked to think of what would happen if the business did not behave in such an ethical manner.   |

Each group researches their assigned topic and prepares a short presentation. Encourage them to include real-life examples of businesses that exemplify their advantage. After the presentations, hold a class discussion to compare the different advantages and how they interrelate. The teacher could create role-playing scenarios where learners must navigate ethical dilemmas faced by businesses. For example, a company considering cutting corners on product safety versus maintaining high standards. After each scenario, discuss the potential consequences of ethical and unethical decisions, focusing on the four advantages. As a reflection activity, learners could write a short paragraph on how they can apply ethical decision-making in their own lives or future careers.   |

| 2.3.3a The conflict between ethics and profit | Learners should understand: • the impact of ethical business behaviour on costs and profit • the possible trade-off between ethics and profit. | Recap understanding of business aims ethical vs. profit from 1.1.2. The teacher to start by defining what ethical business behaviour entails, including honesty, integrity, fairness, transparency, and responsibility. Clarify the concepts of costs (fixed, variable) and profit (gross, net) in a business context. Explain trade-offs in decision-making where ethical considerations may conflict with profit-maximising strategies. Use videos, podcasts, and online articles that discuss ethical dilemmas in business. For example, as learners watch the video, Business Ethics Nestle VS Lush (youtube.com) https://youtu.be/otH6Fz7GJDg, they can record their thoughts as to whether it is possible for a business to be both ethical and profitable. The teacher can lead a class discussion to solicit the learners' opinions.                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Present case studies of businesses that have made ethical decisions and the financial outcomes. What can businesses do to ensure that they are ethical in their approach? Explore the Fairtrade website. Discuss companies that faced scandals due to unethical behaviour (e.g. Volkswagen and the car omissions scandal) and the long-term financial impacts they faced, such as legal costs, loss of reputation, and decline in sales. Organise discussions where learners debate the ethics of various business decisions, such as cost-cutting measures that could impact product quality or employee welfare. Have learners take on roles within a company facing ethical dilemmas (e.g. management vs. employees) to explore different perspectives and consequences. Discuss the potential long-term benefits of ethical behaviour, such as brand loyalty and customer retention. Highlight how ethical practices can lead to increased costs (e.g. fair wages, environmentally friendly materials) but also create value through customer trust and reduced regulatory risks. Ask discussion questions like: 'Can a company be profitable while being ethical? Why or why not?' or 'What are some ethical practices that might lead to higher long-term profits?'.   |

| 2.3.1b Environmental issues caused by businesses activity | Learners should understand how business operations and activity can impact the natural environment, such as: • climate change • congestion • deforestation • pollution • use of finite resources • waste • wildlife. | https://impactday.eu/blog/environmental-impact-in-business/: Provides some good background reading for teachers and ideas as to how business activity and operations can impact the natural environment. A teacher led exposition is likely to be needed to inform learners about the environmental costs of business activity. The teacher could lead a whole class discussion on what the learners think are the advantages and disadvantages to businesses of being environmentally friendly. Having checked that learners understand the various categories that covers the natural environment - this could be done through a 'matching the definitions' task - learners could watch a video clip on environmental problems and note the problems raised in the clip. They could also record the businesses mentioned which they could then investigate further in an independent/group task. Learners could do some research using the internet about a specific example of business in the local area who either are causing harm to the environment or highlight those who are trying to minimise their impact on the environment. Learners could write a brief report on strategies those businesses can adopt to minimise their impact on the natural environment. Patagonia is a UK clothing firm who is trying to make a positive impact on the environment - they have a collection of videos that could act as stimuli for class discussion. |

| 2.3.2b How businesses can act in a sustainable way          | Learners should understand how businesses can act in a sustainable way, such as: • minimising waste • packaging • recycling • renewable energy • responsible consumption and production • use of innovation.                                                                                                                                                                               | Learners can research what is meant by sustainability and a business that has a focus/aim on sustainability. Link back to content covered in Unit 1 1.1.7. Watch the video 'IKEA Sustainability Report FY23 Highlights' to show what IKEA do to be sustainable and environmentally friendly (YouTube). For recycling, learners can explore why the bins in their schools and local fast-food chains are now different by looking at the Welsh Government website: Workplace recycling | GOV.WALES There are many global businesses who are trying to raise their profile about how they act in an environmentally friendly way. This could act as stimuli for class discussions. Learners could then look to see how businesses in their local area are responding to behaving in a sustainable manner: • McDonalds Coffee Sustainability/McDonalds Change a little, change a lot/McDonald's: Using our Scale For Good to take Climate Action   |

| 2.3.3b The impact of businesses acting in a sustainable way | Learners should understand: • the impact on a business of acting in a sustainable way, such as: • increased cost • increased sales • positive reputation • competitive advantage • the impact on society of a business acting in a sustainable way, such as: • improvements to the natural environment • supporting the local economy • improving the health and lifestyle of individuals. | To help introduce this topic to learners, start with familiar brands that they are likely to know, like Nike, Starbucks, or Apple. Show how these companies have adopted sustainable practices. For example, talk about Nike's use of recycled materials or Starbucks' reduction in plastic usage. Learners could also be presented with a simple case study showing a business' journey from being non-sustainable to sustainable. A class discussion could take place showing the changes they made and the outcomes. Greeneconomywales.com has some case studies about Welsh businesses that learners could research and look at how they have adopted sustainable practices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Teachers can explain how consumers today often prefer products from sustainable brands. This can lead to increased sales. Brands like Patagonia have built their image on sustainability, which attracts eco- conscious consumers. Their website highlights the work that they are involved in in your surrounding area. A class stimulus could be to show advertisements from sustainable brands and discuss how sustainability is marketed. Companies with a commitment to sustainability can build a good reputation, which helps them stand out. For example, Tesla has a strong reputation for innovation and environmental responsibility. Learners could discuss how a company's reputation can affect where people choose to work, what they buy, and how they're viewed by the public. Having highlighted the broader social benefits that come from businesses acting in sustainable ways, the teacher can lead a discussion on how sustainable practices can help preserve the environment for future generations. This can be supplemented with examples such as how businesses reducing carbon emissions or waste can help slow climate change. An activity could involve learners identifying local environmental issues (e.g. plastic pollution) and brainstorm how businesses could help solve them. Sustainable businesses often support local suppliers, farmers, or artisans, helping boost the economy. Companies like Ben & Jerry's source ingredients from fair-trade, local farms. Ask learners to research businesses in their community and see which ones use local suppliers or workers. Discuss how this impacts their own area.   |

| Teachers will need to explain that by offering healthier products or creating safer work environments, sustainable businesses can improve people's quality of life. Sustainable businesses like Whole Foods Earth focus on organic, non-processed foods, which can lead to healthier lifestyles. Learners could use this as the basis to form a discussion on how sustainable choices in packaging (e.g. less plastic) can improve public health by reducing pollution.   |

| 2.3.1c Technology available to business | Learners should understand the: • use of technology in business • importance of innovative approaches to technology • types of technology that can be used by businesses, such as: • 3D printing • Artificial Intelligence (AI) • automation • cloud storage • digitisation • e-commerce and m-commerce • electronic point of sale (EPOS) • online payment systems • quick response (QR) codes • robotics • social media. | Teachers could guide learners to explore how and when technology can be used in business in the various departments, e.g. administration - cloud storage, digitalisation, video conferencing etc.; production - 3D printing, robotics automation, etc.; marketing - e- commerce, m-commerce, social media, EPOS, etc. Learners could watch the video on how types of technology are used in business to help them understand the influences on business activity. Teachers should offer a broad range of different business scenarios for the learners to explore how technology is utilised in a variety of businesses of varying sizes. Wired.com contains some videos that could help to reinforce how technology is used in business. Learners could brainstorm the main ways technology impacts business activity, e.g. e-commerce, customer service, communications etc. |

This could be presented in a spider diagram, or learners could be asked to draw their ideas. Learners could suggest possible future technological advances and how these could impact business and society. Learners could create a table including the main benefits and drawbacks of e-commerce. They could consider what are the main benefits for small businesses using eBay or Etsy to sell their products? Read the article 'Primark website crashes as click-and-collect launched' (BBC News) - Learners could then hold a discussion on why Primark are not online for all customers in all locations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| 2.3.2c The impact of technology on a business | Learners should understand the: • impact of technology on business activity, such as changes in: • the workforce • working practices • manufacturing processes • marketing • financial control • customer expectations • cost of implementing technological change • reasons why businesses may not invest in technological change • resistance to implementing technological change. | Teachers could guide learners to explore the benefits and drawbacks of using technology from the point of view of the business and its stakeholders. Teachers should offer a broad range of different business scenarios for the learners to explore how technology is utilised in a variety of businesses of varying sizes. As learners watch the video clip on BBC Bitesize they could record all the various ways in which technology is helping Rikke and her business. Teachers can highlight how remote working has been made possible thanks to technology (like Zoom, Teams, etc.) which allows people to work from home. Collaboration software/tools like Google Docs allows teams to work together even if they're not in the same place. People can now work from anywhere, not just in an office. Some teams are spread across the world, but technology helps them to stay connected and work together. Learners could reflect on where they have used these software packages in school. They can then research or think of businesses (like graphic design or marketing companies) that use remote working to show how technology changes the way we work. |

| Automation now means that there are machines or software doing tasks that people used to do. The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is resulting in computers making decisions or solving problems. Teachers could offer a simplified explanation that technology such as robots and computers can replace some jobs, but it can also create new types of work. For example, self-checkout machines at grocery stores might reduce the need for cashiers, but people are needed to fix and manage the machines. Learners could then be asked to imagine what jobs might disappear and what new jobs might be created in the future because of technology. For marketing, learners could create a mind map all of the ways that they know of that a business uses technology to market themselves. This could include examples such as: • social media platforms and influencers • email marketing • targeted advertising (where platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and LinkedIn Ads use algorithms to deliver ads to specific audiences based on demographics) • behaviour • interest • digital billboards • Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), where retailers use AR and VR technologies to allow customers to visualise products in their own environment before purchasing (e.g. trying on clothes virtually or seeing how furniture fits in a room). For financial control, teachers could get learners to recap their subject knowledge from revenues, costs, and profit (1.7.1-3) and to think about how a business could record this information using a spreadsheet. (This is a precursor to cashflow in 3.3.3). There are many accounting software packages that are offered such as tools like QuickBooks, to help business with bookkeeping tasks such as tracking income and expenses, reconciling bank transactions, and generating financial   |

Invoicing systems can automate the process of sending invoices and tracking payments, reducing delays in receiving payments and improving cash flow control. Learners could brainstorm reasons why businesses may not invest in technological change. High upfront costs, lack of expertise and resistance to change are likely to be some of the main factors impacted a business. Can learners think of a solution to any of these?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 2.3.3c The wider impact of technology used by businesses | Learners should understand how technology used by businesses can impact on: • society • customers • the natural environment • employees. | Teachers could start with a broad overview of technology, then dive into specific areas of impact. Use engaging examples of companies or industries the learners know to make the content relatable. This could be businesses from local, national and global level. BBC Bitesize has some information on new and emerging technologies and their impact on industry that could be used by learners to undertake their own research in these fields. Learners could be given a topic to research in groups for which they then have to take part in a class presentation or group carousel/marketplace activity. (Some of the topics do address 3.6.1 Production so learners could either be told to avoid these sections or they could begin to discuss them in preparation for further teaching later in the course.) Customers now have many different ways of buying from businesses, the rapid increase in e-commerce and m-commerce and the closing down of many high street shops. There has been debate about how customers are choosing to pay by card rather than cash and some businesses even to opting to refuse cash payments. Learners could conduct a quick class survey as to how many times in the last week did they buy online and/or pay by cash versus how many paid by card/mobile transaction. What do they think the reasons for this is? |



{32}------------------------------------------------



| BBC news article, cash payment rise for the first time in 10 years, has  more information on this and an infographic that the learners could be  asked to interpret.  The teacher could explain how the Amazon's recommendation  algorithms or Netflix's streaming services personalise experiences for  customers. Learners could be asked to reflect on how these  technologies influence their personal buying or viewing habits. Could  there be negative consequences, such as over-consumption or  addiction?  For society, this could be through a discussion on how social media  companies like Facebook or TikTok impact communication and the  spread of information. An activity could have learners analysing how  social media has changed how people connect, spread news, and the  risks involved, like misinformation or privacy concerns.  For the natural environment, learners could be asked to explore how  Tesla's electric cars are designed to reduce carbon emissions  compared to traditional gasoline cars. An activity could be to create a  debate on whether the technology used in electric vehicles truly  reduces the overall environmental impact, considering factors like  battery production.  For employees  this could be through the discussion of the role of  automation and AI in companies like Amazon or in fast-food chains  with self-service kiosks. Have learners simulate the experience of  workers being replaced by robots or AI. They could create a mind map  of how it impacts employment rates, job satisfaction, and future  opportunities for workers.  Have learners break into groups representing different stakeholders:  business owners, customers, employees, environmental activists, and  society at large. Use case studies from real businesses that show both  positive and negative outcomes of technology use. For example:   |

| engage in out of classroom learning (either in person or online) in contrasting business sectors                   | 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3 There are several businesses that offer tours of their factories that would allow learners to see technology in action. Alternatively, many manufacturing businesses have published YouTube videos that offer an insight into how technology is used within their business operations. The BBC programme 'Inside the Factory' tracks the manufacturing process of products being made, highlighting the use of technology through the process. Working alongside Careers Wales to allow guest speakers into the classroom, business owners from the local area could come in and speak about how technology impacts their business; how they are responding to behaving in an ethical manner and how they have adapted their practices to be more environmentally friendly. Primary research can be carried out live and face to face outside of the educational setting. Learners could work in pairs or small groups to carry out questionnaires to find out what the local community think about how businesses behave in their local area. This could be as part of a field trip to the local shopping area, during an open or school events |
| explore enterprise and innovation in action for example through engaging with business mentors in person or online | 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3 Young Enterprise (https://www.young-enterprise.org.uk/) offers competitions that learners could engage with to develop their entrepreneurial skills. Learners could explore enterprise and innovation in action by working with local entrepreneurs who can discuss how ethical, environmental and technological issues have influenced their business operations (2.3a, 2.3b, 2.3c). Working alongside Careers Wales and Business Wales Big Ideas Wales to allow guest speakers into the classroom will allow learners to share ideas and gain insight from experienced members of the business community. Learners could research and then write short case studies, individually or in pairs, relating to local or regional enterprises, focusing on how they meet key issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

For example, for 2.2.1 learners could conduct their own research into a business and create an action plan to suggest ways in which they could behave more sustainably (2.3.2b). For 2.3.1c, learners could be asked to make a pitch for how a local firm could embrace more technology to help it operate more efficiently using their knowledge of the context of the firm.   |

| Local, National & International Contexts | There are many opportunities to include Local, National and International Contexts in GCSE Business. These opportunities are important to Learners because by looking at a range of contexts, learners will become more aware of the world around them and that the businesses they have relationships with have had an influence on shaping society. This supports learners to become informed, self-aware citizens as they will start to realise how important business is in shaping societies. Learners should be given the opportunity to explore the nature of their locality as well as national and international contexts for them to appreciate how changes in society have been influenced by business activity. By connecting societal impacts to familiar examples and interactive activities, learners will be able to grasp how societal factors influence business activity and behaviour. This approach fosters critical thinking and awareness of the interconnectedness of businesses and the society they operate in. In Unit 2, the main theme running through the sections of this unit is business in your locality. Learners will have opportunity to explore how the content relates to specific businesses. Teachers will be able to highlight businesses in their own locality, these could be small local businesses through to global businesses that operate in their area. This will allow learners to develop an awareness of businesses in their area and for them to develop a sense of cynefin. Below are some examples of how Local, National and International Contexts can be embedded into teaching and learning: |



{37}------------------------------------------------



| Specification Reference 2.1.2   | Amplification The impact of business on society   | Example By keeping the content relevant to their daily lives and using interactive methods, learners will better understand how businesses impact society. To address the meeting of consumer needs and wants, following a teacher exposition that businesses produce goods and services that meet people's needs (essential things like food, shelter, clothing) and wants (non-essential, like smartphones or designer clothes), learners could be encouraged to reflect on their daily lives: • What products do they buy? • Who makes those products? • How do businesses know what consumers need and want? Learners could brainstorm their top five favourite products and research how businesses meet consumer demand for these products. Businesses can shape culture by promoting certain lifestyles or values through their products or services. Global businesses, especially, can spread cultural ideas worldwide. Teachers could lead a class discussion on how brands influence their personal style, music, food choices, or even how they use social media. Ask learners if they think businesses have too much influence on culture. The class could be split into groups and have them research how a major global brand (such as Nike, McDonald's, or Apple) has influenced culture in different parts of the world.   |

{38}------------------------------------------------



| 2.1.3   | The impact of society on business   | Learners need to understand the relationship between society and business. Having explained what is meant by the term 'demographics', a role-play scenario could be created where learners run a clothing store. Split them into teams and give each team different demographics to cater for (e.g. an older population vs. younger consumers). Ask learners to make decisions about what type of clothes, marketing, and pricing they'd use based on the demographic information. Teachers can then lead a class discussion about how businesses must adapt to changing population structures, like an aging population or growing youth market, and how different age groups have different needs, buying power, and interests. This can be supported with the use of real-world examples like fast fashion for teenagers or the healthcare industry's expansion due to aging populations. To make learners aware of how societal changes affect businesses on different scales: • Local Example : Discuss how businesses in their community are impacted by local demographics or societal issues. Learners could identify a local business and research how it might respond to local societal trends (e.g., a shift to more diverse populations, local environmental concerns). • National Example: Use an example of a business operating at the national level. For instance, explain how companies may adjust their products and marketing strategies to address national trends like an increased focus on health and wellness or economic inequality.   |

{39}------------------------------------------------



|        |                            | • Global Example: Explore how multinational companies adapt to different societies. For example, fast food chains like McDonald's change their menus to match local cultures and values, or how fashion brands might adopt sustainable practices to appeal to global customers who care about ethical production.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 2.3.1a | Ethical business behaviour | Businesses exist on a local, national and global perspective. Regardless of where they operate, they are subject to scrutiny about how they conduct their business activity. Learners could discuss why food miles are such a problem? This could provide a recap why businesses locate internationally. (1.3.2 + 1.3.3) Learners to debate other ethical considerations such as child labour, sale of animal fur, animal testing, cost of pharmaceutical products, unequal distribution of wealth, etc. The True Cost of Fast Fashion - Bridging the Gap. Learners could explore the explore the Co-op fairtrade webpage. |

| Sustainability   | There are many opportunities to include Sustainability in GCSE Business. These opportunities are important to Learners because they help learners understand the long-term impact of business decisions on the environment, society, and the economy. By integrating sustainability into the curriculum, learners develop critical thinking skills around ethical business practices, learn how to balance profit with social responsibility, and become more informed consumers and future business leaders. This knowledge prepares them for a business world increasingly focused on sustainable practices, equipping them with the skills to innovate and contribute to solutions for global challenges such as climate change and resource scarcity.   | There are many opportunities to include Sustainability in GCSE Business.

Groups of learners can act as stakeholders in different businesses (e.g. an energy company, a car manufacturer, or a retail store). Each group explains how their business operations contribute to carbon emissions and climate change (e.g., factories emitting CO2, transportation, etc.). Then, learners propose solutions to reduce their carbon footprint, like using renewable energy or reducing waste. Further discussion points could be to explain how burning fossil fuels by factories and transportation systems increases greenhouse gases, leading to global warming and climate change, or a discussion about businesses' contributions to rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events. |



{41}------------------------------------------------



| For deforestation , learners could be presented with a case study on companies that rely heavily on natural resources, such as palm oil or timber, leading to deforestation (e.g. Amazon rainforest deforestation for agriculture). The class could be split into groups: environmentalists, logging companies, government officials, and indigenous groups. Each group will debate the pros and cons of business operations that cause deforestation. Further activities could involve the learners being asked to explain how businesses in agriculture, logging, and paper production often clear large areas of forest, which destroys wildlife habitats and increases CO2 levels as trees, which absorb carbon, are removed. To address wildlife, assign learners a project where they create posters about how specific industries impact wildlife. For example, fishing industries leading to overfishing, oil companies affecting marine life through spills, or construction projects disrupting habitats. Learners can present their findings and suggest solutions to minimise wildlife harm. This could lead to a class discussion on how businesses can harm wildlife directly (through deforestation or habitat destruction) or indirectly (through pollution, climate change, or introducing invasive species). The teacher can encourage discussions on eco-friendly business practices that protect biodiversity, such as wildlife conservation and habitat restoration.   |

| 2.3.2b   | How businesses can act in a sustainable way   | To help drive the concept of Packaging, Innovation and Responsible Consumption, teachers could conduct a branding workshop where learners design eco-friendly brand identities for products or companies. This could include developing sustainable packaging ideas, creating marketing campaigns focused on responsible consumption, and highlighting environmental benefits. Learners could then feedback to the class explaining how their ideas align with sustainable values. To increase awareness of sustainability efforts already present in everyday environments and inspire action, learners could conduct research into sustainable practices, such as minimising waste, packaging and recycling, that are already present in their local area. This could include finding examples of sustainable packaging, zero-waste initiatives, or renewable energy sources. Learners could conduct a waste audit of their classroom/school. Collect and analyse one day's waste to identify what can be reduced, reused, or recycled. This will make learners aware of the amount of waste they generate and help them brainstorm how businesses can reduce waste at each stage of production.   |

| 2.3.3b 2.3.2c   | The impact of businesses acting in a sustainable way The impact of technology on a business   | Show short videos about companies embracing sustainability or TED Talks on sustainability. Sustainable practices often involve an initial investment in eco- friendly materials, technologies, or processes. For example, building solar panels or sourcing organic materials may cost more upfront. Split learners into groups and give them a fictional business budget. Ask them to decide how they would balance sustainability investments and profits. Teachers can explain how businesses that are sustainable can gain a competitive edge by differentiating themselves. For example, Unilever's sustainable living plan made them a leader in the personal care industry. Learners could brainstorm how a business could use sustainability to out-compete a rival business. Factories use machines to make things quickly and consistently. Imagine cars being built by robots rather than humans. Factories use automation/robots to make products faster and more   |

There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE Business. These opportunities are important to Learners because they equip learners with essential skills to navigate complex business challenges and make informed decisions. By incorporating Critical Thinking and Problem Solving into the GCSE Business curriculum, learners develop the ability to analyse situations, evaluate options, and implement effective solutions. These skills are crucial not only for academic success but also for future employment, as employers increasingly value candidates who can think independently and approach problems creatively.

Engaging in critical thinking activities encourages learners to question assumptions, assess the reliability of information, and consider multiple perspectives before reaching conclusions. This analytical mindset fosters a deeper understanding of business concepts and promotes informed decision-making in real-world scenarios.

Furthermore, opportunities to practice problem-solving techniques help learners learn how to break down complex issues into manageable parts, identify root causes, and develop strategic plans for addressing challenges. These experiences cultivate resilience and adaptability, preparing learners to face the uncertainties and rapid changes in today's business environment. Ultimately, enhancing critical thinking and problem-solving skills empowers learners to become proactive contributors to their organisations and communities, capable of driving positive change and innovation.

Below are some examples of how Critical Thinking and Problem Solving can be embedded into teaching and learning:

| Critical Thinking and Problem Solving   | Specification Reference 2.3.3c   | Amplification The wider impact of technology used by business.   | Example Teachers could start with a broad overview of technology, then dive into specific areas of impact. Use engaging examples of companies or industries they know to make the content relatable. This could be businesses from local, national and global level. For society , this could be through a discussion on how social media companies like Facebook or TikTok impact communication and the spread of information. An activity could have learners analysing how social media has changed how people connect, spread news, and the risks involved, like misinformation or privacy concerns. For customers , the teachers could explain how the Amazon's recommendation algorithms or Netflix's streaming services personalise experiences for customers. Learners could be asked to reflect on how these technologies influence their personal buying or viewing habits. Could there be negative consequences, such as over-consumption or addiction?   |

They could design surveys, organise data collection, and analyse results, which requires both time management and attention to detail. This would allow them to practice planning a project from start to finish and organising their findings to make informed business decisions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Personal Effectiveness   | There are many opportunities to include Personal Effectiveness in GCSE Business. These opportunities are important to Learners because it will help them with understanding that they are part of a larger community and that their actions can significantly impact others. By integrating Personal Effectiveness into the GCSE Business curriculum, learners can cultivate essential soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and conflict resolution, which are vital for building positive relationships in both personal and professional settings. Learning about Personal Effectiveness encourages learners to reflect on their own values, strengths, and weaknesses, fostering self-awareness and emotional intelligence. This self-reflection promotes empathy, as learners learn to consider the perspectives and feelings of others in their decision- making processes. Moreover, understanding the importance of compassion in business practices can lead learners to appreciate diverse viewpoints and recognise the significance of inclusivity in teams and organisations. This awareness helps create a culture of respect and collaboration, where individuals feel valued and supported. By developing empathy and compassion, learners are better prepared to navigate the complexities of interpersonal relationships in the workplace, making them more effective leaders and team members. Ultimately, these skills not only enhance their personal effectiveness but also contribute to creating a more ethical and supportive business environment. Below are some examples of how Personal Effectiveness can be embedded into teaching and learning:   |

| Specification Reference 2.3.1   | Amplification Learners should know what is meant by business ethics.   | Example • Social Responsibility: Teachers will need to explain that businesses have a responsibility to the society they operate in. This could mean donating to charity, protecting the environment, or helping communities. Learners could research companies known for social responsibility (e.g. Patagonia, Ben & Jerry's) and ask them to present their findings on how the company gives back. Further discussion could be to ask, "Do you think businesses should be responsible for improving society, or should that be left to the government?". • Reflect on Personal Experiences : Encourage learners to think of times when they've faced ethical issues, such as seeing misleading ads or encountering discrimination.   |
