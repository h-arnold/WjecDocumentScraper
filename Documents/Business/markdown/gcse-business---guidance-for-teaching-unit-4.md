## <span id="page-5-0"></span>Overview of Unit 4

Business Creation 25% of the qualification Assessment Type: Non-examination assessment 60 marks

#### The purpose of this unit is to:

- allow for synoptic links to be made to the other three units
- allow learners to consider a wide range of business concepts and themes in a practical sense
- allow learners to consider how businesses are created
- develop a wide range of business skills.

Through this unit learners will be able to further develop:

- enquiry and investigation skills
- creativity skills
- the ability to present business data
- the ability to analyse and evaluate business data
- in the context of planning an entrepreneurial activity.

The unit will be based on the following concepts, due to the synoptic nature:

- business and society
- business fundamentals
- business strategies for success
- change
- cynefin
- economies
- enquiry and investigation
- enterprise/entrepreneurship
- ethics
- innovation
- opportunities and challenges
- sustainability.

For this assessment learners are required to identify an opportunity for an entrepreneurial activity in their locality. This opportunity must meet the needs of people and society.

Learners will be required to carry out primary and secondary market research to collect information for their entrepreneurial opportunity, and to use the research to produce a report that covers key aspects of their proposal.

The assignment, which will include a brief and several tasks, will be issued to centres in an Assessment pack via the WJEC Portal. Tasks are not intended to change for the lifetime of the qualification. If candidates choose to resit this unit at a later date, they must choose another entrepreneurial opportunity to explore. Centres have the flexibility to decide when, during the assessment year, learners undertake the assignment.

This assessment contributes to 25% of the overall qualification grade and will take 8 hours to complete. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions. The assignment will be marked out of a total of 60 marks.

{6}------------------------------------------------

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be marked by the centre and moderated by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be hand written and scanned, or completed digitally).

| 4.1.1 Opportunities for entrepreneurial activity | Learners should understand: <ul><li>the role of enterprise in society</li><li>how entrepreneurial activity can meet the needs of people and society. Learners should be able to identify entrepreneurial opportunities.</li></ul> | Recap knowledge from Unit 1: 1.1.2 Teacher to facilitate a discussion on ways enterprises can support society through different stakeholders in society. Teacher selects one local and one national business and asks learners to explain how the business meets the needs of people and society. Learners to give reasons, using research, to justify how enterprises can meet the needs of people and society. Learners to give reasons, using research, to justify where entrepreneurial opportunities exist in the local area and nationally. Teachers could work alongside Careers Wales and their Education Business Partnership to invite guest speakers, such as local entrepreneurs to present to learners as to how they identified the entrepreneurial opportunity and how this has impacted their enterprise and their community. Learners can investigate one local business and summarise how the business meets the needs of the local community. Learners can carry out research into local, national and global enterprises in similar markets to create case studies based on their similarities and differences in meeting the needs of society. |

{8}------------------------------------------------

|  |  | Learners could carry out a blue-sky thinking activity, individually or in groups, to consider what is missing from their local community, why it is needed and why it might not be available (i.e. lack of demand, lack of infrastructure). Learners could discuss how a new local enterprise (real or fictional) could support local people and society. Each learner could be assigned a separate role to investigate the impact of the enterprise on that role, i.e. a potential customer, the local council, a potential local supplier or a local competitor. |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 4.1.2 Entrepreneurial characteristics and skills | Learners should understand the characteristics of an entrepreneur, such as: <ul><li>initiative</li><li>innovation</li><li>risk taking</li><li>resilience</li><li>determination and commitment. Learners should understand the skills of an entrepreneur, such as:</li><li>creativity</li><li>leadership</li><li>problem solving</li><li>organisation</li><li>decision making.</li></ul> | Recap knowledge from Unit 1: 1.1.2 Pair work on identifying the characteristics and skills listed. Learners given the terms in the specification and asked to explain what each means in terms of why they are important characteristics for an entrepreneur. Learners could consider a range of international high-profile entrepreneurs, developing profiles for individual contemporary entrepreneurs, such as Steven Bartlett, Mark Zuckerberg, Sara Davies, Mahmud Kamani and Elon Musk, or more established traditional entrepreneurs such as Richard Branson, Peter Jones, Touker Suleymen and Deborah Meaden. Learners should consider how the entrepreneur shows one of more of the characteristics. Learners could interview owner(s) of a local enterprise to identify how that entrepreneur developed the idea for the enterprise, how they built their enterprise, how they overcame the challenges they faced in the process and how they used the skills of an entrepreneur. Learners could use Startups 100 – the UK's Hottest New Businesses Startups.co.uk to identify new start up enterprises and identify how they were established from a range of business sectors. |

{9}------------------------------------------------

|  |  | Learners could watch episodes from The Apprentice and discuss how these characteristics and skills are demonstrated by contestants. Learners could consider their skills set and link it to those of an entrepreneur using skills audits such as The Enterprise Catalyst. |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 4.1.3 Elkington's triple bottom line model | Learners should understand Elkington's triple bottom line model. Learners should be able to apply Elkington's triple bottom line model to entrepreneurial opportunities. Learners should be able to give reasoned judgements on: <ul><li>the potential success of entrepreneurial opportunities</li><li>how entrepreneurial opportunities can impact people, the community, society and the natural environment.</li></ul> | Learners identify the three elements of Elkington's Triple Bottom Line (Profit, People, Planet) and explain what they mean. Learners watch Elkington's Triple Bottom Line (CSR)   Reference Library   Business   tutor2u and summarise the main points. Learners give examples of how enterprises can address the three elements of the triple bottom line. Learners apply the triple bottom line to enterprises using evidence to support statements and developed reasoned judgements. Learners could consider: <ul><li>Profit- Economic Performance - for example: Is the enterprise profitable? Or could it be? How do you know? Will shareholders gain a dividend/owners receive profit? What could be improved? How?</li><li>People- Social Performance - for example: Focus on the stakeholders, how will/are staff be treated? How will/does enterprise contribute to local community?</li><li>Planet- Environmental Performance - for example: What impact does the enterprise have on the planet in terms of pollution/use of non-renewables, what level of recycling can the enterprise achieve? How sustainable is the enterprise? What is the likely carbon footprint? Teachers could use resources such as Bizconsesh with learners to illustrate how elements of the triple bottom line interlink.</li></ul> |

{10}------------------------------------------------

Learners could read explanations from BBC Bitesize on [ethical](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zh2ff4j/revision/1) and [environmental](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zh2ff4j/revision/2) then explore how these influences impact enterprises in their area and beyond.

Learners could research enterprises such as Ben and Jerry's, North Face, Huel and many other Corp [B certified companies,](https://bcorporation.uk/) international, national and local, to show how they work towards their triple bottom line by setting sustainability objectives, including people, community, society and the natural environment, as well as profit related objectives. Learners could create a Venn diagram for one of these enterprises to show what activities and objectives carried out by the enterprise meets the elements of profit, people and planet.

Teacher could work alongside [Careers Wales and their Education](https://careerswales.gov.wales/education-and-teaching-professionals/employer-support-for-schools)  [Business Partnership](https://careerswales.gov.wales/education-and-teaching-professionals/employer-support-for-schools) guest speakers from local Corp B certified businesses to visit learners to talk about why triple bottom line is important in their enterprise and how it has helped the enterprise succeed.

Learners could discuss how enterprise has changed from being profit driven to considering the wider impacts of the enterprise. Learners could discuss why enterprises have joined this shift and what happens when there are negative impacts of enterprise on the environment, such as bad publicity and its impact on profit.

| 4.2.1 Business proposals for entrepreneurial opportunities | Learners should be able to propose and outline entrepreneurial opportunities, including: <ul><li>the product/service</li><li>the market/sector</li><li>location</li><li>the scale</li><li>the target market</li><li>the ownership model</li><li>meeting the needs of the locality</li><li>obtaining suitable sources of finance</li><li>sourcing raw materials/stock</li><li>calculating costs, revenues and profit</li><li>creating a cash flow forecast.</li></ul> | Learners to use the knowledge gained from their learning in Units 1 – 3. Learners apply each of the bullet points to a given enterprise opportunity. Teachers could work alongside Business Wales Big Ideas Wales and arrange role models to talk to learners about their enterprise. Using their knowledge from 3.3.3, learners identify realistic inflow and outgoings of an enterprise and use this information to complete a 12- month cashflow. Where the use of IT is made for cashflow, learners are not expected to create their own template with a formula - this can be provided. The teacher can provide the cash flow forecast template. A quiz on knowledge from the bullet points (e.g. Blooket or Kahoot!) could be used as a classroom activity with learners working together or individually to answer the questions set by the teacher. Teachers could recap prior knowledge from Units 1 – 3 covering the bullet points using knowledge dump carousel activities, allowing small groups of learners to work together to recall everything they remember about one of the bullet points before moving on to another bullet. Groups work on different bullets and rotate with short intervals to keep pace. Once all have been completed, gaps in knowledge can be identified and discussed. Teachers can direct learners to BBC Bitesize to recap prior learning where appropriate, such as forms of ownership BBC Bitesize, target market BBC Bitesize, site and location BBC Bitesize and finance BBC Bitesize. |  |

{12}------------------------------------------------

|  |  | Learners could work in small groups to apply each of the bullet points for two familiar products or services, one local and one regional/national. This could then be presented back to peers live or digitally. |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 4.2.2 Addressing key issues for entrepreneurial opportunities | Learners should be able to consider the following key issues when proposing entrepreneurial opportunities: <ul><li>being innovative</li><li>contribution to the local economy</li><li>creating prosperity</li><li>ethical behaviour</li><li>impact on people, the community and society</li><li>the natural environment</li><li>use of technology.</li></ul> | Using knowledge from Units 1 – 3, learners consider these key issues in relation to a range of entrepreneurial opportunities. Teachers could work alongside Careers Wales and their Education Business Partnership guest speakers to present to learners about the way they dealt with these areas in establishing and operating their enterprise. Teachers could work with LPA (Local Planning Authority) in local council, invite a member of town planning to present to learners to look at how enterprise impacts local areas. Learners could research and then write short case studies, individually or in pairs, relating to local or regional enterprises focusing on how they meet two or more of these key issues. These can be shared with peers to develop an understanding of how different enterprises meet these key issues differently. Learners could investigate the role of pressure groups such as Greenpeace and PETA to gain an insight into how they advise businesses to act in an ethical way. |

{13}------------------------------------------------

### 4.2.3 Market research for entrepreneurial opportunities

Learners should be able to:

- carry out different forms of primary and secondary market research methods to inform entrepreneurial opportunities
- use an appropriate sample
- design and use appropriate market research tools to collect data for entrepreneurial opportunities, such as:
  - questionnaires
  - interview questions
  - secondary research log

Learners use prior knowledge of market research from Unit 3.

Learners create different tools for carrying out appropriate primary research that allows them to investigate an enterprise proposal.

Use Word and other suitable ICT to create primary market research tools.

Teacher to go through how to design questionnaires and interviews in order to be effective.

Teacher could share fictional 'bad' examples of questionnaires and interview questions, i.e. leading questions, too many open questions. Learners could identify the reasons why these are not suitable and consider the impact on the quality of information that will be gathered from them. Learners to suggest and justify alternative questions.

Teacher to explain the difference between quantitative and qualitative information and give examples. Learners to research relevant examples of quantitative and qualitative information.

Learners to consider what is meant by an appropriate sample size. Learners to consider an appropriate sample for a small range of different entrepreneurial opportunities.

Learners identify appropriate secondary research for a given purpose, for example they may use the [local census](https://explore-local-statistics.beta.ons.gov.uk/) data or web rating sites such as [TripAdvisor.](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/)

Learners to design tools to allow them to gather secondary market research data and use these to carry out research for a specific purpose.

{14}------------------------------------------------

|  | <ul><li>present data from market research data, including graphs and charts.</li></ul> | Learners present information and data gathered in an appropriate manner, for example the use of pie charts to show a 100% response to one option in a closed question is not appropriate, or the use of line charts to show discrete data sets. Teachers could use BBC Bitesize to help learners consider this process. Learners given data sets of quantitative and qualitative information and challenged to present the data appropriately. Teachers could use the local census data quiz on the ONS to help learners develop an understanding of their locality and the demographics of it. Learners could work in pairs or small groups to carry out questionnaires to find out what the local community think about an entrepreneurial idea in their area as part of a field trip to the local shopping area, during an open or school events evening at the centre or online. The data and information collected could be analysed as a group, with conclusions drawn and presented appropriately. |

| 4.2.4 Marketing mix for entrepreneurial opportunities | Learners should be able to create a marketing mix for entrepreneurial activities: <ul><li>product</li><li>price</li><li>place</li><li>promotion.</li></ul> | Learners use prior knowledge of the marketing mix from Unit 3. Teachers could recap knowledge using videos such as TwoTeachers Marketing mix. Teachers could provide a range of familiar products and services and challenge learners to identify and justify the marketing mix for these items. Items could be physically and/or digitally presented and could range from mobile phones to breakfast cereals and cars. Learners could share ideas in discussions. Learners apply each element of the marketing mix (product, price, place and promotion) to a small range of different entrepreneurial opportunities |

{15}------------------------------------------------

Learners should be able to identify appropriate market segments for entrepreneurial activities. Learners use evidence to make supported decisions for each element of the marketing mix to create and evaluate appropriate marketing mixes for entrepreneurial opportunities. Learners could consider potential success and challenges as a result of the marketing mix. Teachers could check for any gaps or common misunderstandings using/developing a quiz (e.g. [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/gb) or [Kahoot!](https://create.kahoot.it/auth/login)) as a classroom activity. Learners use prior knowledge of segmentation from Unit 3. Teacher gives learners a range of different entrepreneurial opportunities and learners to identify appropriate market segments Learners to identify and justify appropriate market segments for an entrepreneurial opportunity of their own choice.
