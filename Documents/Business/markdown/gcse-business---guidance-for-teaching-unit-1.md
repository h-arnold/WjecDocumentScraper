### 1.2.2 Exploring job market trends in Wales, UK and the wider world

Learners should be aware of:

- current job market trends in Wales, UK and the wider world
- how the changing workplace can impact the skills needed by businesses and employers in the future.

**Starter** - create a table and list five jobs that were common in the past, five jobs that are present today, and five jobs that you think will be invented in the future.

### ONS - [Wales Industry Data](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/industryandoccupationenglandandwales/census2021)

The above website shows the latest job market trends.

Explore the growth of Women in Innovation – teachers could create case study material here.

<https://iuk.ktn-uk.org/programme/women-in-innovation/>

[https://iuk.ktn-uk.org/casestudy/women-in-innovation-success-stories](https://iuk.ktn-uk.org/casestudy/women-in-innovation-success-stories-deborah-coughlin/)[deborah-coughlin/](https://iuk.ktn-uk.org/casestudy/women-in-innovation-success-stories-deborah-coughlin/)

Teachers can show the latest information and use whole class discussion to identify trends in the current job market in Wales.

Teachers can print off graphs/raw data from the ONS and create a question and answer worksheet.

**Whole class discussion** into the reasons for changes in job market trends and how such changes can impact skills needed by employers in the future. This may include hybrid working and skills required to work from home.

### 1.4.3 The impact of business on stakeholders

Learners should understand the impact of business on stakeholders, including:

- employment
- environmental
- ethical
- financial
- operational
- products and services
- social.

1.4.4 Types of conflict between stakeholders and business

Learners should be aware of types of disagreement and conflict between businesses and stakeholders and between different stakeholders, such as:

- acting ethically
- environmental damage
- low prices
- low wages
- maximising profit
- quality of products.

- low wages

**Teacher led** explanation on how business activity and decisions can impact stakeholders.

**Learner activity** – create a table listing all internal and external stakeholders and explain how each stakeholder can be impacted by a business' activities and actions.

A variety of scenarios can be provided to learners.

For example, a national or global retail/food outlet opens in the local area and learners can discuss how this can affect the variety of stakeholders, to include impacts on employment/environment/ ethics/financial and operational implication/the variety of products and services and its social impact.

Read [https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/burger](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/burger-van-opposite-new-five-23282401)[van-opposite-new-five-23282401](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/burger-van-opposite-new-five-23282401)

What impact did a global food restaurant have on a local business/community?

**Starter:** Teacher gives three possible conflicts, for example:

- maximising profit vs price rise for products.
- low wages vs acting ethically
- quality of products vs low prices.

**In pairs** - learners to link these to different stakeholders and explain the conflict.

Read article:<https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-43659124>

What has the government done to try to restrict the issue of sugar in fizzy drinks? How does this show stakeholder conflict?

**Research task** – use the internet to find out one recent business example of conflict between different stakeholders

| are important to learners because they help learners understand the importance of sustainable   |

| pillars of sustainability. They will be able to explore the Wales Future Generations Act and UN |
| sustainable development goals and think about creative and innovative solutions to tackle       |
| climate change and related global issues.                                                       |

**There are many opportunities to include Career and Work-Related Experiences (CWRE) in GCSE Business. These opportunities are important to learners because they will start to critically evaluate the pathways available for them in the future. It will provide information on what support and guidance is available and help with making decisions for further study or employment.**

**Learners will be able to assess current job market trends and use this to reflect on their currents skill set and explore what skills may be needed in the future. This will enable them plan and prepare before they start making decisions on a suitable future pathway.**

**Below are some examples of how CWRE can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

## Cross-curricular Skills - Numeracy

**There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE Business. These opportunities are important to learners because the ability to work with numbers and use mathematical equations and formulas will enable learners to understand how businesses can manage their finances effectively to become efficient and profitable. It will also enable learners to identify patterns and spot trends, helping with making business decisions.** 

**Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

| There are many opportunities to include Personal Effectiveness in GCSE Business.
