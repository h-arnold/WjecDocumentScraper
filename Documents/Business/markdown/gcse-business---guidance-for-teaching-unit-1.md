| Local, National & International Contexts | There are many opportunities to include Local, National and International Contexts in GCSE Business. These opportunities are important to learners because the variety of contexts will enable learners to become more self-aware citizens and understand how the nature of businesses have helped to shape society and communities. This will allow learners to develop a sense of cynefin. Below are some examples of how local, national and international contexts can be embedded into teaching and learning: | There are many opportunities to include Local, National and International Contexts in GCSE Business.

Learners can use case studies, articles and videos that provide examples of local, national and global businesses and how the products and services differ in each market. They can research the rise of local Welsh businesses and examine their context and the reasons for success. Learners could also look at current employment opportunities in their local area via local job searches. |

| Sustainability   | There are many opportunities to include Sustainability in GCSE Business. These opportunities are important to learners because they help learners understand the importance of sustainable business practices on the environment, economy and society. This will help them reflect on business decisions as well as their own decisions and explore how they align with the three pillars of sustainability. They will be able to explore the Wales Future Generations Act and UN sustainable development goals and think about creative and innovative solutions to tackle climate change and related global issues. Below are some examples of how Sustainability can be embedded into teaching and learning:   | There are many opportunities to include Sustainability in GCSE Business.

Learners could look at the importance of the three pillars of sustainability and apply these to local business in Wales. Learners could look at renewable energy (also known as green energy) and research how it used in restaurants within their local area, as well as those restaurants that are national and international. Many restaurants, such as 'Nando's', promote their policies and practices on sustainability.

As stated in the learning experience above, learners could begin to identify employment prospects and future learning/career pathways. Using Careers Wales, and The National Careers Service, learners could research a number of different careers. This research could involve looking at careers within both private and public sectors, and the skills and qualifications needed for those that interest them. Learners could undertake online 'career match quizzes', or 'skills assessments', giving them more insight into future careers.                                                          |

| Reading   | Specification Reference All areas   | Example Teachers should use recent news articles (such as BBC news) and case studies, to engage learners in developing independent reading and research. Learners should summarise and synthesise these news articles and case studies in areas such as globalisation (1.3.2), supply chain management (1.6.1) and the green and circular economy (1.6.2). Teachers could have set questions following the study of these articles to ensure learners have absorbed the necessary information, and they are able to search through texts to find relevant sources of information.                                            |

| Speaking  | Specification Reference All areas   | Example Q&A sessions and group collaborative working and feedback. Teachers should be using Q&A sessions in all topic areas, both in small groups, as well as a class. This not only enhances understanding for the learners, but builds their confidence in speaking in front of others, expressing their opinion. Teachers could facilitate a collaborative, group working opportunity when teaching ' The features of limited and unlimited liability organisations ' (1.5.1). Within the teaching of this topic, learners could work in groups to explore the features of limited and unlimited liability organisations. |



{38}------------------------------------------------



| Writing   | Specification Reference All areas   | Example Learners will use a variety of writing techniques when performing different tasks such as: • summarising • synthesising • informative writing • evaluation techniques. When tackling ' Sustainability' (1.1.7), learners could create a sustainability poster to raise awareness for younger learners in the school. It is imperative that learners use different language (formal and informal) when targeting specific audiences.   |
