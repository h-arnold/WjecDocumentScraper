Unit 2

The purpose of this unit is to introduce learners to business and society. Learners will apply
their knowledge and understanding in the context of one of the key themes that are relevant
to the contemporary business environment:
•  business ethics

The knowledge and understanding gained from Unit 1 will allow learners to fully explore
these key themes in the context of real business.

Through this unit learners will be able to develop:

the ability to present business data
the ability to analyse and evaluate business data.

innovation

For this assessment learners are required to investigate a business that operates in their
locality. The business they investigate can be a local scale business only operating in the
locality or a national or global business that has a presence in the locality.

Learners will be required to undertake research on their chosen business and to use their
research findings to produce a report. Part A of the report will be compulsory, but for part B,
WJEC will select two themes from the specification content (Business ethics, Business and
the environment and Business and Technology) and centres and/or learners will choose one
of the selected themes.

The assignment, featuring the two selected themes and associated tasks, will be released
during the first week of September for assessment for that academic year and will change
annually. The themes are published in the Assessment Pack for Unit 2 for five years. This
will be updated to ensure there are always five years’ worth of themes to allow for forward
planning. Centres have the flexibility to decide when, during the assessment year, learners
undertake the assignment. However, it is important that centres select the topic from the
year that they plan to submit the work for marking as this may be different to the year that
the candidates undertake the assessment.

This assessment contributes to 15% of the overall qualification grade and will take 5 hours to
complete. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions.
The assignment will be marked out of a total of 48 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be set and marked
by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be hand written and scanned,
or completed digitally).

information for their entrepreneurial opportunity, and to use the research to produce a report
that covers key aspects of their proposal.

The assignment, which will include a brief and several tasks, will be issued to centres in an
Assessment pack via the WJEC Portal. Tasks are not intended to change for the lifetime of
the qualification. If candidates choose to resit this unit at a later date, they must choose
another entrepreneurial opportunity to explore. Centres have the flexibility to decide when,
during the assessment year, learners undertake the assignment.

This assessment contributes to 25% of the overall qualification grade and will take 8 hours to
complete. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions.
The assignment will be marked out of a total of 60 marks.

Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:
•  Specification – this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to

know by the end of their course.

•  Assessment Pack –  this contains the Sample Assessment Materials(SAMs) i.e.: sample
exam papers and sample NEA tasks, relevant controls for the NEA and, mark schemes.

This guide builds upon the information in the specification and assessment pack to help
further your understanding of said documents.

Understanding the specification amplification

Learners should be made aware of:
•

Specification Stems

When you look through the specification you will notice in the amplification column, we use a
