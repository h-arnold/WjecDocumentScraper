## Aims of the Delivery Guide

The aim of the Delivery Guide is to give an overview of the qualification and to help teachers understand how we assess the GCSE. It will offer an introduction to the specification, an assessment overview, and will support teachers in better understanding how to prepare their learners for the assessment of the different units. More information on each unit can be found in the separate unit guides.

|        | Unit title                         | Type of Assessment         | Weighting |
|--------|------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------|
| Unit 1 | Introduction to the Business World | Written examination        | 30%       |

All units are compulsory. The qualification is not tiered.

<span id="page-3-2"></span>

## Unit 1

The purpose of this unit is to:

- introduce learners to the key concepts to be explored throughout the course
- introduce learners to skills
- introduce learners to business fundamentals
- introduce the business world and build up knowledge to allow for meaningful analysis and investigation of the themes that follow.

The unit will be based on the following concepts:

- business and society
- business fundamentals
- economies
- enterprise
- innovation
- opportunities and challenges
- sustainability.

{5}------------------------------------------------

<span id="page-4-0"></span>

## Unit 2

The purpose of this unit is to introduce learners to business and society. Learners will apply their knowledge and understanding in the context of one of the key themes that are relevant to the contemporary business environment:

- business ethics
- business and the environment
- business and technology.

The knowledge and understanding gained from Unit 1 will allow learners to fully explore these key themes in the context of real business.

Through this unit learners will be able to develop:

- enquiry and investigation skills
- the ability to present business data
- the ability to analyse and evaluate business data.

The unit will be based on the following concepts:

- business and society
- business fundamentals
- change
- cynefin
- economies
- enquiry and investigation
- ethics
- innovation
- opportunities and challenges
- sustainability.

For this assessment learners are required to investigate a business that operates in their locality. The business they investigate can be a local scale business only operating in the locality or a national or global business that has a presence in the locality.

Learners will be required to undertake research on their chosen business and to use their research findings to produce a report. Part A of the report will be compulsory, but for part B, WJEC will select two themes from the specification content (Business ethics, Business and the environment and Business and Technology) and centres and/or learners will choose **one** of the selected themes.

The assignment, featuring the two selected themes and associated tasks, will be released during the first week of September for assessment for that academic year and will change annually. The themes are published in the Assessment Pack for Unit 2 for five years. This will be updated to ensure there are always five years' worth of themes to allow for forward planning. Centres have the flexibility to decide when, during the assessment year, learners undertake the assignment. However, it is important that centres select the topic from the year that they plan to submit the work for marking as this may be different to the year that the candidates undertake the assessment.

This assessment contributes to 15% of the overall qualification grade and will take 5 hours to complete. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions. The assignment will be marked out of a total of 48 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be set and marked by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be hand written and scanned, or completed digitally).

{6}------------------------------------------------

<span id="page-5-0"></span>

## Unit 3

The purpose of this unit is to:

- build on the knowledge and understanding gained from Unit 1
- develop greater critical thinking
- develop learner understanding of the critical issues facing business and ways in which these can be solved
- develop learner understanding of external factors affecting businesses
- introduce learners to effective strategies for success.

The unit will explore the following key business functions:

- financial
- marketing
- human resources
- production.

The unit will be based on the following concepts:

- business and society
- business fundamentals
- business strategies for success
- change
- economies
- enterprise
- ethics
- innovation
- opportunities and challenges
- sustainability.

{7}------------------------------------------------

<span id="page-6-0"></span>

## Unit 4

The purpose of this unit is to:

- allow for synoptic links to be made to the other three units
- allow learners to consider a wide range of business concepts and themes in a practical sense
- allow learners to consider how businesses are created
- develop a wide range of business skills.

Through this unit learners will be able to further develop:

- enquiry and investigation skills
- creativity skills
- the ability to present business data
- the ability to analyse and evaluate business data
- in the context of planning an entrepreneurial activity.

The unit will be based on the following concepts, due to the synoptic nature:

- business and society
- business fundamentals
- business strategies for success
- change
- cynefin
- economies
- enquiry and investigation
- enterprise/entrepreneurship
- ethics
- innovation
- opportunities and challenges
- sustainability.

For this assessment learners are required to identify an opportunity for an entrepreneurial activity in their locality. This opportunity must meet the needs of people and society.

Learners will be required to carry out primary and secondary market research to collect information for their entrepreneurial opportunity, and to use the research to produce a report that covers key aspects of their proposal.

The assignment, which will include a brief and several tasks, will be issued to centres in an Assessment pack via the WJEC Portal. Tasks are not intended to change for the lifetime of the qualification. If candidates choose to resit this unit at a later date, they must choose another entrepreneurial opportunity to explore. Centres have the flexibility to decide when, during the assessment year, learners undertake the assignment.

This assessment contributes to 25% of the overall qualification grade and will take 8 hours to complete. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions. The assignment will be marked out of a total of 60 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be marked by the centre and moderated by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be hand written and scanned, or completed digitally).

# Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:

- Specification this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to know by the end of their course.
- Assessment Pack this contains the Sample Assessment Materials(SAMs) i.e.: sample exam papers and sample NEA tasks, relevant controls for the NEA and, mark schemes.

This guide builds upon the information in the specification and assessment pack to help further your understanding of said documents.

<span id="page-9-1"></span>

### Understanding the specification amplification

Learners should be made aware of:

- the specification stems
- what the specification stems mean.

<span id="page-9-2"></span>

### Specification Stems

When you look through the specification you will notice in the amplification column, we use a variety of wording before the list of content learners need to know; we call this a stem:

![](_page_9_Figure_12.jpeg)

Each stem is used for a slightly different reason:

| Specification<br>Stem          | When it is used                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Learners should<br>be aware of | When learners do not need to understand all aspects of the<br>specified content in detail. Teachers should refer to Guidance for<br>Teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and breadth<br>to which this content should be taught. |
| Learners should<br>know        | When learners are required to demonstrate basic knowledge and<br>understanding.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Learners should<br>understand  | When learners are required to demonstrate greater depth of<br>knowledge and understanding, application of knowledge to familiar<br>or unfamiliar contexts and analysis and evaluation of information for<br>a given purpose.                    |
| Learners should<br>be able to  | When learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to<br>a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills and<br>techniques.                                                                                     |

{11}------------------------------------------------

<span id="page-10-0"></span>

### Command words

Learners should be made aware of:

- what command words are
- what each command word means
- what each command word assesses.

Command words are the words and phrases used in assessments that tell learners how they should answer the question or complete the task. Command words direct the learner through the question or task and indicate the nature of the response required.

![](_page_10_Picture_7.jpeg)

The following tables are not exhaustive, but will give you a good idea of the command words we typically use:

| Command words for direct recall   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
