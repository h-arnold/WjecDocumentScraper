The teacher can then explain what is meant by business growth. Group activity on defining the different reasons why businesses grow. Learners provided with stimulus material (such as text, data, graphs, infographics, photographs, video clips, etc.) of businesses that have grown. Learners can use this to develop their ideas on how each business has benefitted from growth and feedback their ideas to the class. Learners could select a business to research from a specified list relating to their local area and display their ideas into a class 'word cloud' or a 'diamond 9' ranking. Learners could discuss features of their local area that has led to some factors having a greater importance than others. |

| 3.1.2 Internal and external methods of growth   | Learners should understand: • internal growth • external growth • the internal growth methods a business may use, including: • increasing advertising and promotion • investment • launching new products • looking for new markets • selling more of current products in existing markets • the external growth methods a business may use, including: • mergers • takeovers.   | Referring to research from 3.1.1, learners can contribute to a discussion on the methods used by their business to grow. Teachers can collate their ideas on the whiteboard and ask if there are any similarities or differences between the methods used, leading into internal and external growth. Learners can be given a range of different businesses showing how they have grown and asked to categorise them into internal and external growth methods. Focusing on a local business of their own choice, learners could be asked to summarise how the business has attempted to grow and then explain the success or failure of the methods used. Learners to investigate two recent mergers and two recent takeovers and produce a summary.   |

| 3.2.1 Political factors                               | Learners should understand how businesses may be impacted by authority and government in Wales and the UK, including: • government spending • regulation • taxation • other government policies, such as: • environmental • immigration • equal opportunities • education. | Teachers may wish to gain an understanding of learners' prior knowledge on this topic by a free writing carousel-style activity using the topic areas of 3.2.1/3.2.2/3.2.3 on flip-chart paper. Learners should understand how setting up and running a business in Wales could be affected by both the Welsh and UK Governments. This understanding should include areas unique to Wales (such as the role of Business Wales and the Development Bank of Wales in government spending) as well as UK wide political factors that impact on Wales (such as income tax). Learners should also gain an appreciation that authority in Wales and the UK can also be influenced by social and political norms and values on a global scale. For example, how the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goals has influenced political objectives in Wales through the Sustainable Development Goals of Wales (such as Welsh government support for the circular economy (e.g. beyond- recycling-strategy-document.pdf (gov.wales)). Learners need to understand that political decisions by governments will have an impact on business activity, the main areas of focus include: • Regulation: Teacher led explanation on how the government and other bodies of authority (for example, CMA, FCA and FSA) regulate business activity. Discussion on why regulation is needed for businesses using the following headings - employment, advertising, health and safety and environmental. |



{11}------------------------------------------------



| Learners can be given one regulatory body and asked to research  what it does and present back to the class.  •  Taxation:  The teacher provides basic definitions of the different types of tax in  the UK - income tax, NI, VAT and corporation tax, and facilitates a  discussion on what each one means. A discussion on how changes in  tax could impact a business.  Learners given short statements about changes in different taxes and  asked to comment on the impact on consumers.  Learners could be given the information on taxation to learn how  governments generate income. (Use information for Wales How is the  Welsh Government spending its budget in 2024-25? (senedd.wales)  and the UK Spring Budget 2023 (HTML) - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk).  •  Government spending:  Learners could contribute their ideas as to how governments spend  their money and the relative proportion of income that is spent on  education, healthcare, transport, etc., and their own estimates can be  compared with actual figures.  Learners should also develop an understanding of areas unique to  Wales, such as the role of Development Bank of Wales Business  Finance For Companies In Wales - Dev Bank  (developmentbank.wales) and Business Wales Homepage | Business  Wales (gov.wales) in providing funding and support for existing  businesses and those seeking to grow. Learners could be provided  with case studies from their local area (Case Studies, Helping  Businesses Like Yours - Dev Bank (developmentbank.wales)) or  complete their own research from the websites to develop their  understanding of how they may impact businesses in Wales.   |

| • Other government policies: • Environmental - for example, how the adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goals has influenced political objectives in Wales through the Sustainable Development Goals of Wales (such as Welsh Government support for the circular economy (e.g. beyond-recycling-strategy-document.pdf (gov.wales)). • Immigration - for example, how changes in immigration post- Brexit have affected industries such as transport, hospitality, retail and agriculture. (What impact has Brexit had on the UK economy? - BBC News). Also, how changes to immigration law (e.g. rise in minimum income, ban on care workers bringing family/dependents to the UK) have affected businesses in sectors such as retail, hospitality and care (Changes to UK visa requirements: Key points at-a-glance - BBC News). Learners to research one recent UK Government policy and one Welsh Government policy and explain how the policy could impact businesses and consumers. A stakeholder mapping exercise could be conducted to identify how the stakeholders of a specific business relevant to the local area of the learners, might be affected by a change in one (or more) of the political factors, e.g. higher income tax rates. Each point should then be further developed to show the impact it has on the business.   |

| 3.2.2 Legal factors   | Learners should understand the legal factors which influence a business, including: • employees' rights and responsibilities, including: • contracts of employment • equality • national minimum wage and national living wage • safe working conditions • the right to join a trade union • unfair dismissal.   | Learners need to understand that there are a number of different legal factors that will influence business behaviour and that businesses must act within the law. Employees rights and responsibilities: • Contract of employment - Learners could be presented with a sample contract of employment to identify and label its key features. • Equality - Learners can identify the nine protected characteristics from the Equalities Act 2010 and consider how it may influence any business who employs staff. This could be referred to in 3.5.1 where learners are given a sample job advert or a list of interview questions and asked to identify where it breaks the Equality Act, and to redraft the advert/questions to ensure it meets the requirements. • National minimum wage/national living wage - learners can identify the different rates of pay. News articles or video clips could be used to show the consequences to employers of failing to pay the specified rate of national minimum wage/national living wage. • Safe working conditions - learners can explore the role of the employer and the employee in safeguarding employees' health, safety and welfare at work. Learners could explore the different types of safety signage that may be seen in the workplace using the HSE website (Safety signs and signals. The Health and Safety (Safety Signs and Signals) Regulations 1996. Guidance on Regulations L64 (hse.gov.uk)). Learners could focus on a business well-known to them in the local area to identify the likely health and safety signage available. Alternatively, the school's health and safety officer could talk about their role in school in ensuring legal requirements are met. • The right to join a trade union - learners should know that they have a legal right to join a trade union. They could spend time briefly researching what benefits an individual would receive from trade union membership.   |

| • how consumers are protected when buying goods and services, including: • unfair selling practices • faulty goods • payment protection • intellectual property law, including: • copyright • patents • Trademarks   | • Unfair dismissal - learners could act in the role of a judge, exploring various scenarios where an employee had been dismissed and giving a verdict as to whether it was 'fair' or 'unfair' with their reasons why. • Learner could produce a help sheet for new employees and a new entrepreneur on employees' rights and responsibilities. Consumer protection: • Learners should have an awareness of the main types of consumer protection that protects consumers when buying goods and services. Each area (unfair selling practices, faulty goods and payment protection) can be allocated to pairs of learners and they can research and produce a summary to share with the class. • Learners could explore case studies of consumers who have bought goods/services that do not meet these requirements and how this has been rectified using the legislation. • Learners to use the internet to identify legislations protecting consumers and how it protects them. Intellectual property: • Copyright - learners could first explore the types of work copyright laws are able to protect before exploring how the law could be used in practice. Current chart music that samples the work of former artists could be played, explaining how the artists are legally able to do so by crediting the work and paying a fee to the originator. The copyright case involving Ed Sheeran and Sami Switch (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-61006984) would provide a good basis for discussion, with learners listening to the work of both artists before deciding if they feel Ed Sheeran had deliberately copied Sami Switch's work.   |

| • environmental law, including: • the need to recycle (such as, Wales's Workplace Recycling Regulations 2024) • the journey to net zero (such as the Environment (Wales) Act 2016).   | • Patents - learners could focus on understanding patents before exploring Dyson's product range. Each small group could be allocated a product from the range and asked to explain how it is different from its competition. Learners could then explore why patents are important for a business such as Dyson. • Trademarks - learners could be shown small sections of trademarked logos and asked to guess the logo. Slogans/phrases could be given and learners asked to match the business to the phrase. Alternatively, they could explore or be asked to identify brands that have become verbs (such as Google = to search, Hoover = to vacuum) or replaced nouns (Tippex, Kleenex, Sellotape etc). Learners should then use this to explain why trademarks are so important. Cariad: Welsh word for love trademarked, sparking anger - BBC News could also be used as a discussion point. Environmental law: • The need to recycle - Using Workplace recycling | GOV.WALES for guidance, learners could explore what provisions the legislation has made businesses implement. The video https://youtu.be/dugNwqSP2KI could be shown as a practical example of how the legislation has affected a Welsh business before exploring this for a business in their local area. • The journey to net zero - WG44621 Working together to reach Net Zero: All Wales Plan 2021-25 (gov.wales): Teachers could select appropriate case studies from this document best reflecting their local area and focus on how local organisations are working towards net zero. Using some of the suggestions for organisations contained within Team Wales: Tackling the climate emergency together (gov.wales) and their own ideas, learners could create pledges suitable for businesses within their local area that would   |

| 3.2.3 Economic factors   | Learners should understand how businesses are affected by economic factors, including: • disposable income • inflation • interest rates • unemployment. Learners should be aware of how economic factors change over time.   | Teachers may wish to gain an understanding of learners' prior knowledge on this topic by a free writing carousel-style activity using the topic areas of 3.2.3 on flip-chart paper. A simple matching exercise of the key terms, definitions and the effect of the economic factor to help learners understand. • Disposable income - learners should first understand what is meant by the term 'disposable income' before being provided with a map of businesses in their local area. Learners can identify and discuss which business may be positively and negatively affected by increases or decreases in disposable income and how they would be affected (for example, a cobbler/second hand store/discount food shop may be positively affected by a decrease in disposable income through an increase in sales and market share, whereas an estate agent/restaurant may be negatively affected by falling sales, falling revenue, etc.). • Inflation - learners should first understand that inflation is a general rise in the price level of an economy before exploring how businesses may be affected by inflation. Using October 2023 CPI rate of 11.1% and more recent/lower rates of inflation, learners can identify how periods of high and low inflation will affect local businesses and their customers. • Interest rates - learners should understand that interest rates are the reward for saving money/the cost of borrowing money, before exploring how this will affect businesses. This should be through a business as a borrower of money, as well as the impact on its customers. • Unemployment - learners could be given data of trends in unemployment in Wales and their local area over time and asked to identify and explain how this will positively and negatively impact on businesses in their local area.   |

| Learners should be exposed to quantitative data and diagrams to help illustrate the economic factors at a local, Welsh and UK level. Learners to be asked to comment on what the data shows and explain the impact on a number of different businesses. Learners should be given clarification on how economic factors change over time. This can be included with each factor or as an additional activity.   |

| 3.3.1 Sources of finance               | Learners should understand: • the different sources of finance available to a business, including: • internal sources: • owners' capital • retained profit • selling assets. • external sources: • bank loans • government grants • leasing/hire purchase • new investors • share issue • overdraft • trade credit. • the advantages and disadvantages of different sources of finance. | Learners could first be asked to identify where a business may get the finance it requires to set up/expand/ease cashflow problems. After this, learners could be asked to match the term to the definition and categorise it as internal or external. Next, learners could be given a 'fill in the missing words' or card sort activity to explain the benefits and drawbacks of each source of finance. (Note, each of the sources of finance specified should be covered). Finally, learners could be given case-study material relating to local businesses and asked to select appropriate sources of finance for the business in question and justify their reasoning. Learners should be able to select suitable sources of finance for businesses operating at different scales and ownership. |

| 3.3.2 Income statements               | Learners should understand the key components within an income statement: • sales revenue (turnover) • cost of sales • gross profit • expenses • net profit (or loss). Learners should be able to calculate and interpret an income statement.                                                                                                                                                                     | Learners should be referred back to 1.7 where they initially covered costs, revenue and profit. Learners should be presented with a simple example of an income statement, with teachers using this to guide them through each component and how they may be calculated. This can be extended by providing income statements containing blank values and asking learners to complete the missing values. For each income statement provided, learners could be asked to interpret business performance from the statement by looking at the key components to make judgements. Learners can be given income statements for a business for two years and asked to interpret. Learners use a spreadsheet package to create an income statement using raw data. Use formulae to make calculations.   |

| 3.4.1 Market research                  | Learners should know what is meant by market research. Learners should understand the difference between primary and secondary market research and the different methods businesses may use to undertake market research, including: Primary research: • consumer panels • focus groups • interviews • observation • surveys. Secondary research (internal): • financial data • loyalty card data • sales information. Secondary research (external): • competitor information • government sources • internet • magazines • newspapers • trade publications. Learners should understand the advantages and disadvantages of primary and secondary market research. | Teachers should first clarify if learners have any prior understanding of the terms primary/secondary research and how such research could be obtained by a business. Learners given the different methods of primary and secondary research used by businesses and either in pairs or individually give a description to the class. Learners could be given a matching activity to link the key term to the definition. To stretch their understanding further, learners could be asked to give a context when each of the types of research could be used by a local business. Finally, learners could be presented with a scenario(s) using businesses from the local area and asked to give a brief presentation on what types of research they would recommend to the business and to justify their choices. Learners complete a card-sort activity where they match the advantages and disadvantages of using primary research, secondary (internal) and secondary (external) research. |

| 3.4.2 Segmentation   | Learners should understand: • why businesses use market segmentation • the different ways a business may segment its market, including: • demographic (such as age, race, sex and gender) • geographic • income • lifestyle.                                                 | Teachers should first explain what segmentation is and why a business may use it before exploring the different ways a business may segment its market. McDonalds could provide a good starting point for discussion on how a business could segment its market.

| 3.5.2 Training | Learners should understand: • the benefits of providing training for both the business and the employee • different types of training, including: • on-the-job (such as coaching, job shadowing) • off-the-job (such as off-site, external trainers). Learners should know the situations in which training is required, including: • induction • diversity and equality • legislated training (such as health and safety) • responding to changes in the workplace • future proofing the workplace • new technology and the changing workplace • upskilling. | (reskilling) Learners could be given the benefits of training from the point of view of the business and the employee and develop an explanation of how this leads to a positive outcome. Split the class in two, all the class is given a job task to do, half of the class are given training for the task and the other half receive no training - Learners to compare the success using worksheets provided and use it to have a class discussion on the importance of training. Learners could watch a video or read a case-study that shows the different types of training a business may use. They could then identify which are on-the-job methods and which are off-the-job methods before creating a brief explanation of each type of training shown. Teacher provides terms and definitions of the different situations for the learners to match. Looking at each of the situations in which training is required in turn, learners could identify what is required by the training and which method(s) would be suitable to achieve this. Learners need to apply knowledge of training to recommend the most suitable method of training for businesses in different contexts and scenarios. |



{27}------------------------------------------------



| 3.5.3 Motivation   | Learners should know what is meant by motivation. Learners should understand: • the different ways in which a business can motivate its workers, both financial (such as wages, bonuses, commission, fringe benefits) and non-financial (such as training, job rotation, job enrichment, empowerment) • the benefits of a motivated workforce to the business and the employee.   | Each learner to state what motivates them to do things. Discussion on how the school/teacher tries to motivate the learners. Use mind mapping to write responses down and whole class question and answer to identify common reasons and explanations of the benefits. Using a number of real businesses that include local, national and global businesses, learners to find examples of financial and non- financial methods of motivation. Learners could create a mind-map of reasons why a motivated workforce is important to a business before adding more annotation to their work to explain how it benefits the business (and then repeat for employee).   |

For example, products should not be produced using child labour, thereby protecting a child's right to an education (Article 28) and the right to be protected from doing work that is dangerous or bad for their education, health or development (Article 32). All individuals are entitled to their human rights being met without any kind of discrimination. This influences businesses' interactions with their customers in the provision of goods and services, as well as with employees/potential employees through the recruitment process and training opportunities provided. |

Learners will calculate gross and net profit as well as missing values within an income statement. Learners will also calculate components of a cashflow forecast as well as missing values within a cashflow forecast. Learners will calculate gross and net profit margins and understand how variables could be manipulated to improve profitability. With all of the above, learners will be presented with financial data which they will interpret and then form judgements on the performance of a business. |

| Understanding the number system helps us to represent and compare relationships between numbers and quantities            | Specification Reference 3.2.3   | Amplification Economic factors                     | Example Inflation - learners can compare the most recent, highest rate of inflation with more recent, lower rates of inflation. Learners can use the numerical data to develop a fuller understanding of inflation, and how periods of high and low inflation will affect local businesses and their customers. Interest rates - learners will use rates of interest (Bank of England base rate data is easily accessible) to understand that interest rates are the reward for saving money/the cost of borrowing money before exploring how changes in the rate of interest will affect businesses. This should be through a business as a borrower of money, as well as the impact on its customers.   |

| Learning that statistics represent data and that probability models chance help us make informed inferences and decisions | Specification Reference 3.4.1   | Amplification Market research - understanding data | Example Learners could use data from primary and secondary research in order to make informed business decisions. For example, learners could collate and present their own data from a questionnaire based on a local business to make relevant decisions (for example, relating to the market mix). Learners could also be presented with (or collect their own) relevant secondary data, such as financial accounts, competitor accounts and census data, in order to make informed business decisions.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
