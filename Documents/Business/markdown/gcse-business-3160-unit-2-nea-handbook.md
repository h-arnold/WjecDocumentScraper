### <span id="page-3-1"></span>Managing the assessment

This is a WJEC marked (external) non-examination assessment. The following arrangements must be followed when managing the assessment.

#### **Task setting**

This assignment has been produced by WJEC and cannot be changed.

#### **Time**

Candidates must be allowed five hours to complete this assessment. Candidates should spend approximately:

- 2 hours 30 minutes completing task 1
- 1 hour 30 minutes completing task 2
- 1 hour completing task 3 OR 4.

The time suggested for each task takes account of the contribution of the task to the overall assessment requirements. There can be no changes to the total time available for this assessment. Centres can, however, amend the suggested time available for each task.

#### **Resources**

Candidates must have access to the candidate brief and any necessary resources, as specified in the detailed task tables within the brief.

#### **Collaboration**

Group work is not allowed. Candidates must complete all tasks individually.

{4}------------------------------------------------

#### **Supervision**

All tasks in this unit are taken under indirect supervision:

| Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |  |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
|          | Candidates do not need to be directly supervised at all times.                                                                                                                                                                                           |  |
| Indirect | The centre must ensure that: <ul><li>all candidates participate in the assessment</li><li>there is sufficient supervision to ensure that work can be authenticated</li><li>the work an individual candidate submits for assessment is his/her own.</li></ul> |  |
|  | Candidates' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be stored securely between timetabled sessions. |  |

Centres must have in place systems to ensure candidates cannot access evidence they have been developing outside of supervised activities.

#### **Authentication**

Supervision must be in place to ensure the authenticity of evidence produced for summative assessment.

You should not provide input or guidance to candidates during the assessment time. This includes providing formative feedback on the evidence being produced. You can provide guidance on the requirements of the task and remind candidates of the mark bands and how they can be interpreted.

Candidates can review and redraft evidence independently within the time controls for the assessment.

Candidates must sign the declaration to confirm that the work was completed within the time controls, all evidence submitted for moderation is their own work and that any sources used have been acknowledged.

Assessors must sign the declaration to confirm that evidence submitted for moderation was completed under the controlled conditions set out in this assessment.

#### **Candidate evidence**

The acceptable formats for evidence of each of the tasks is summarised in the task tables. Any modified assessment must enable the candidate to generate the evidence required in this table

{5}------------------------------------------------

#### **Task marking**

WJEC will mark all evidence produced by candidates.

Centres **must** ensure that a candidate cover sheet is completed for every candidate and attached to the front of the candidate's work.

Centres **must** also ensure that candidates complete a candidate declaration form.

#### **Notes on the completion of the Candidate Declaration Form**

- The form must be completed and securely attached to the Candidate's work, and sent to WJEC
- The form can be completed electronically or manually. Electronic signatures will be accepted.

#### **Further information**

You should refer the JCQ Instructions for conducting non-examination assessment for further information on managing assessment within our GCSE Qualifications.

## <span id="page-6-0"></span>Assessment details

For this assessment learners are required to investigate a business that operates in their locality. The business they investigate can be a local scale business only operating in the locality or a national or global business that has a presence in the locality.

Learners will be required to undertake research on their chosen business and to use their research findings to produce a report. Part A of the report will be compulsory, but for part B WJEC will select two themes from the specification content (Business ethics, Business and the environment and Business and Technology) and centres and/or learners will choose **one** of the selected themes.

The assignment, featuring the two selected themes and the associated tasks, will be released during the first week of September for assessment for that academic year and will change annually. Centres have the flexibility to decide when, during the assessment year, learners undertake the assignment.

This assessment contributes to 15% of the overall qualification grade and will take 5 hours to complete. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions. The assignment will be marked out of a total of 48 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be set and marked by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be handwritten and scanned, or completed digitally).

The two themes selected each year from the specification content are shown below:

| Year of submission | Choice of theme (Part B) (Centres and/or candidates to select one from the selected themes) |  |  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--|
| 2026                  | Ethics                                                                                               | Business and the environment |  |
| 2027                  | Business and technology                                                                              | Ethics                       |  |
| 2028 | Business and the environment | Business and technology |  |
| 2029                  | Ethics                                                                                               | Business and the environment |  |
| 2030                  | Business and technology                                                                              | Ethics                       |  |

Centres and/or candidates select **one** theme from the two above to answer Part B.

It is important that centres select the topic from the year that they plan to **submit** the work for marking as this may be different to the year that the candidates undertake the assessment.
