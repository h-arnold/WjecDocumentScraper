INTRODUCTION

1.1  Aims

GCSE Business supports learners to develop:
•  an understanding of the activities that make a business successful
•  an appreciation of the complex, pluralistic and diverse nature of society by

understanding the role and influence of business and innovation on people,
places, and community

•  an understanding of business processes, incentives, and outcomes, within their

cynefin, and how these can influence opportunities for prosperity

•  an understanding of the relationship between business and the environment
•  an understanding of technology and its impact on business, the environment, and

people

•  an understanding of the ethical implications of a business.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales’ Approval Criteria.

1.2  Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Business qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales
framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make
progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification.
Central to this design are the principles of progression, along with the statements of
what matters and those subject specific skills and concepts outlined in the ‘Designing
your Curriculum’ section of the Humanities Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to
embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral
skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple
mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for
Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for
integrating the learning experiences noted in Opportunities for integration of learning
experiences on page 38, the Guidance for Teaching will include further information
on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

The GCSE Business qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:
•  supporting the statements of what matters0F

1 by giving learners the opportunity to:

•  gain a deeper understanding of the concepts underpinning humanities, and

their application in local, national and global contexts

•  gather, justify, present, analyse, and evaluate a range of evidence
•  explore how and why interpretations may differ and by critical understanding
of a range of interpretations and representations derived from a variety of
evidence

•  understand and appreciate how and why places in their locality and
elsewhere in Wales, as well as in the wider world, are changing

•  understand, as producers and consumers, their own impact on the natural

world

GCSE BUSINESS 7

•  develop their own identity and an awareness of how they, as individuals, can

shape the communities in which they live

•  heighten their awareness of how the future sustainability of our world and

climate change is influenced by the impact of those actions

•  appreciate how the evolution of places, communities and societies is driven

by the interplay between a range of factors, including environmental,
economic, social, political and cultural processes and human actions

•  develop an understanding of their responsibilities as citizens of Wales and the

wider interconnected world

•  develop as self-aware, informed, ethical global citizens, who critically reflect

on their own and others’ beliefs, values and attitudes.

•  supporting the principles of progression1F

2 by encouraging learners to:

•  ask increasingly sophisticated enquiry questions
•  demonstrate greater independence in finding suitable information, making

informed predictions and hypotheses, and making judgements
increase their breadth and depth of knowledge and underlying concepts

•
•  develop an understanding of themselves in the world
•  demonstrate an ability to work with an increasing number and sophistication
of sources of information, and a growing understanding of how to resolve
contradictory or conflicting accounts

•  demonstrate a growing ability to transfer existing skills and knowledge into

new, and increasingly unfamiliar contexts.

•  supporting the subject specific considerations for Business 2F

3 by:

•  developing an understanding of business and its value to individuals, society

and the Welsh national and global economy

•  enabling learners to appreciate that the environment in which business takes

place is constantly changing

•  appreciating the impact of business on people’s lives and the environment
•  examining ways in which businesses succeed or fail and the strategies

required for success

•  developing an understanding of the contribution that business has in shaping
the prosperity of communities and thereby people’s prospects for the future

•  exploring business creation through enterprise and entrepreneurship
•  developing skills to empower business problem-solving and decision making.

The GCSE Business qualification is based on the following concepts:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

business and society
business fundamentals
business strategies for success

GCSE BUSINESS 8

1.3  Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is
designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the
conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages
3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills
and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares
learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation
for the study of Business at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification
provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do
not progress to further study in this subject.

1.4  Guided learning hours

GCSE Business has been designed to be delivered within 120 – 140 guided learning
hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for
learners in years 10 and 11.

1.5  Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our
language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect
and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and
adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising
that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to
ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres
of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always
be on the website.

1.6  Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic,
religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible,
features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access
and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual
orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to
enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills
without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the
following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access
Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This
document is available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of
provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete
barrier to any part of the assessment.

Unit 2

GCSE BUSINESS 40

For this assessment learners are required to investigate a business that operates in
their locality. The business they investigate can be a local scale business only
operating in the locality or a national or global business that has a presence in the
locality.

Learners will be required to undertake research on their chosen business and to use
their research findings to produce a report. Part A of the report will be compulsory,
but for part B, WJEC will select two themes from the specification content (Business
ethics, Business and the environment and Business and Technology) and centres
and/or learners will choose one of the selected themes.

The assignment, featuring the two selected themes and associated tasks, will be
released during the first week of September for assessment for that academic year
and will change annually. The themes are published in the Assessment Pack for Unit
2 for five years. This will be updated to ensure there are always five years’ worth of
themes to allow for forward planning. Centres have the flexibility to decide when,
during the assessment year, learners undertake the assignment. However, it is
important that centres select the topic from the year that they plan to submit the work
for marking as this may be different to the year that the candidates undertake the
assessment.

This assessment contributes to 15% of the overall qualification grade and will take 5
hours to complete. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple,
shorter sessions. The assignment will be marked out of a total of 48 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be set and
marked by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be hand
written and scanned, or completed digitally).

Unit 4

For this assessment learners are required to identify an opportunity for an
entrepreneurial activity in their locality. This opportunity must meet the needs of
people and society.

Learners will be required to carry out primary and secondary market research to
collect information for their entrepreneurial opportunity, and to use the research to
produce a report that covers key aspects of their proposal.

The assignment, which will include a brief and several tasks will be issued to centres
in an Assessment pack via the WJEC Portal. Tasks are not intended to change for
the lifetime of the qualification. If candidates choose to resit this unit at a later date,
they must choose another entrepreneurial opportunity to explore. Centres have the
flexibility to decide when, during the assessment year, learners undertake the
assignment.

This assessment contributes to 25% of the overall qualification grade and will take 8
hours to complete. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple,
shorter sessions. The assignment will be marked out of a total of 60 marks.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

5.1  Entries and awards

GCSE BUSINESS 43

This is a unitised qualification. Candidates are entered for each unit separately.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer assessment period each
year, for the lifetime of the specification.

Unit 1, Unit 2 and Unit 3 will be available in 2026 (and each year thereafter). Unit 4
will be available in 2027 (and each year thereafter) and the qualification will be
awarded for the first time in summer 2027.

Pre-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or under on 31st August in the
academic year in which they were entered)

The terminal rule is set at 40% of the overall qualification for Pre-16 Candidates for
GCSE Business.

If the assessment being re-taken contributes to the 40% terminal rule requirement,
the mark for the new assessment will count regardless of previous results in that
assessment.

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score
from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade subject to the
terminal rule being satisfied first, i.e. that candidates must complete 40% of the
assessment for a qualification in the series in which they are cashing in.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the
third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s).
This is referred to as a 'fresh start'. When retaking a qualification (fresh start), a
candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from
examination units taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating the new
grade(s).

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not
count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in
the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be used for the life of the specification.

Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1st September in the
academic year in which they are entered)

There is no terminal rule that applies to Post-16 Candidates for GCSE Business.

There is no limit on the number of times a candidate can resit an individual unit;
however, the better uniform mark score from the most two recent attempts will be
used in calculating the final overall grade.

The ‘fresh start’ rule does not apply to post-16 candidates.

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not
count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in
the final resit series.
