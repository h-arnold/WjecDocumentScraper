**9.** EdenHarvest is a zero-waste food retailer. It opened in 2020 and has two shops: one in Cardiff, South Wales and one in Llandudno, North Wales.

> Unlike most other food retailers, EdenHarvest buys its products in bulk and sells them to consumers without packaging. Customers bring their own containers and can select from a large range of products including fresh fruit and vegetables, frozen foods, bread, pasta, rice, chocolates, cereals, tea and coffee.

EdenHarvest also sells a range of packaged organic products including soft drinks, baby food, nuts and seeds, tinned fish and vegetables, oils and vinegars, and a range of health and skincare products.

Every month the two shops hold workshops to demonstrate how to live in a more waste-free way. Staff are also encouraged to spend time talking to customers.

The business has gained loyal customers who like the flexibility to be able to choose the quantity or weight of each product they buy. However, the owners of EdenHarvest are concerned that sales revenue has decreased in recent months. They believe that the reasons for this are:

- many of the products it offers are priced higher than less environmentally friendly products sold in supermarkets
- many local people in Cardiff and in Llandudno are not aware of EdenHarvest.

#### **MARK SCHEME**

#### **Guidance for examiners**

#### **Generic marking principles**

- Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
- Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.
- Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
- Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

#### **Positive marking**

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising candidates for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates' answers. The list is not exhaustive. The inclusion of *'Credit any other valid response.*' (or similar instruction) within mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates' responses. Credit should be given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates' answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However, unless there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks where the answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

#### **Banded mark schemes**

For band marked questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in candidates' answers. It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate's response. As noted above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive and candidates do not have to include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been provided, no marks should be awarded.

{18}------------------------------------------------

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each candidate's response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills, knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors or omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate's answer to pick out the evidence that is being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied. This is done as a two-stage process.

#### **Stage 1 – Deciding on the band**

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate's answer and check whether it matches the descriptors for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the descriptors most closely matches the work.

#### **Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark**

Having determined the appropriate band, deciding on the mark within a band will be made on the basis of a 'best fit' procedure, weaknesses in some areas being compensated for by strengths in others.

Examiners should use the full range of marks available to them. Marking should be positive, rewarding achievement rather that penalising failure or omissions. The awarding of marks must be directly related to the marking criteria, and all responses must be marked according to the banded levels provided for each question.

Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be provided during standardising and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work. Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the standardising material as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the work submitted.

This mark scheme instructs examiners to look for and reward valid alternatives where indicative content is suggested for an answer. This is not a checklist for expected content in an answer, or set out as a 'model answer', as responses must be marked in the banded levels of response provided for each question. Where a candidate provides a response that contains aspects or approaches not included in the indicative content, examiners should use their professional judgement to determine the validity of the response in light of the task and reward as directed by the bands. Candidates are free to choose any approach that is relevant to the set task. Candidates can (and will most likely) incorporate ideas other than those mentioned in the mark scheme.

(a) Identify and explain the method of production Jenkins Bakery is likely to use to make its products.

Award **one** mark for identifying:

• batch production.

Award **one** mark for explaining batch production:

- Batch production is a suitable method as it allows Jenkins Bakery to make different quantities of different products to meet customer demand.
- (b) Consider why quality is important to Jenkins Bakery.

#### **Indicative Content**

Answers may refer to the following:

- Meeting customer expectations Jenkins Bakery has relied on customers enjoying its products and then making repeat purchases. Customers expect the same high standards of quality on each future visit. For example, if its sandwiches do not have as much filling in as previous visits they may switch to a competitor.
- Improving customer satisfaction Since customers are likely to regularly purchase from their local Jenkins Bakery store, they are likely to have a more personal level of service from the staff, such as remembering what loaf of bread they usually purchase. This will increase customer satisfaction.
- Improving brand reputation Jenkins Bakery may be well-known in the local area for selling high quality products. Customers may leave good reviews on TripAdvisor or Google, for the business, which will encourage new customers to try its products, increasing sales.
- Encouraging repeat purchases Customers will trust Jenkins Bakery to always produce a high quality product. This means that they will become regular customers and are more likely to purchase other items from its product range, such as buying a cake alongside their regular loaf of bread.
- Reducing cost If products are produced right first time, then items will not need to be scrapped. For example, if its cakes are decorated in a poor-quality way then they cannot be sold and will go to waste.

{26}------------------------------------------------

• Avoiding legal action – If products are found to be defective/faulty in any way then the company may be sued. For example, if it produced nut free products but cross-contamination in the kitchen meant a customer had an allergic reaction, then it could be costly to the business and reduce profit margins.

**9.** EdenHarvest is a zero-waste food retailer. It opened in 2020 and has two shops, one in Cardiff, South Wales and one in Llandudno,

North Wales.

Unlike most other food retailers, EdenHarvest buys its products in bulk and sells them to consumers without packaging. Customers bring their own containers and can select from a large range of products including fresh fruit and vegetables, frozen foods, bread, pasta, rice, chocolates, cereals, tea and coffee.

EdenHarvest also sells a range of packaged organic products including soft drinks, baby food,

Every month the two shops hold workshops to demonstrate how to live in a more waste-free way. Staff are also encouraged to spend time talking to customers.

The business has gained loyal customers who like the flexibility to be able to choose the quantity or weight of each product they buy. However, the owners of EdenHarvest are concerned that sales revenue has decreased in recent months. They believe that the reasons for this are:

- many of the products it offers are priced higher than less environmentally friendly products sold in supermarkets.
- local people in Cardiff and Llandudno are not aware of EdenHarvest.

(b) Advise the owners of EdenHarvest on how they can adapt their marketing mix to increase sales revenue.

#### **Indicative Content**

Answers may refer to the following:

- **Price** Skimming, psychological and cost-plus could all be justified to be suitable to EdenHarvest. Competitive pricing/penetration pricing are unlikely to be suitable as it cannot offer the same/lower prices as large supermarkets due to the nature of its business.
- Psychological pricing could be the most suitable pricing strategy for EdenHarvest as it will make the product appear cheaper in the minds of consumers and so may encourage them to purchase. This is important as the more eco-friendly products EdenHarvest sell are more expensive than the non-eco-friendly products offered by its competitors. However, the reduction of a few pence off the selling price alone may not be enough to tackle the falling revenue the business has seen in recent months.
- **Product** Expand zero packaging product range (e.g. herbs and spices, fresh fish/meat), move into new product areas (e.g. household cleaning products). Remove packaged products, even though these are organic they may confuse the customer as they are not zero-waste. Rebrand EdenHarvest to emphasise its USP as a zero waste business. Packaging cannot be awarded as the business is a zero waste store and it does not fit with its USP.
- Expanding its product range would ensure that customers could shop with EdenHarvest and purchase most of their products in one location, therefore increasing sales revenue and customer loyalty from customers who share its passion for reducing waste. However, adding extra products may require extra equipment, such as fridges and chilled display cabinets, as well as extra staff. This may not be suited to EdenHarvest at the current time as there are still lots of people who are unaware of its business and so products may go to waste if there are insufficient customers.
- **Promotion** Advertising media (e.g. leafleting local area, local newspaper adverts) to increase customer awareness within their local area, sponsored social media advertising to target people who may be interested in a zero waste store (for example, those who shop for second-hand clothing, buy fair trade products or who drive electric vehicles), sales promotion (e.g. loyalty card schemes, discounts on new products) in order to encourage existing customers to purchase more items.
- In order to raise awareness, promotion in the local area could be a good idea. EdenHarvest could leaflet the local area at a relatively low cost to inform customers of its business and to explain why it is important to shop in a zero-waste store. This will persuade customers to try its store and will lead to an increase in revenue. If these customers have a positive experience, they will become repeat purchasers. However, using leaflets would go against the ethos of the shop. People may discard a leaflet as it is seen as junk mail, and cause litter.
- **Place** Expand to more affluent areas to be closer to its target market, offer a home delivery service. Look at investing in e-commerce/m-commerce, although this may not be suitable due to having no packaging. Potential to sell to businesses that share the same aims (e.g. eco-friendly café/restaurant).
- EdenHarvest needs to consider if it is in the right location for its business. It may benefit from moving to more upmarket areas, where people may earn higher salaries and have more disposable income to spend on 'luxury' items. Many businesses would benefit from an online

store; however this is not suitable to EdenHarvest as it would need to add packaging to its products in order to transport them which would go against its USP.
