Managing the assessment

This is a WJEC marked (external) non-examination assessment. The following
arrangements must be followed when managing the assessment

Task setting

This assignment has been produced by WJEC and cannot be changed.

Time

Candidates must be allowed five hours to complete this assessment. Candidates should
spend approximately:

•  2 hours 30 minutes completing task 1
•  1 hour 30 minutes completing task 2
•  1 hour completing task 3 OR 4.

The time suggested for each task takes account of the contribution of the task to the overall
assessment requirements. There can be no changes to the total time available for this
assessment. Centres can, however, amend the suggested time available for each task.

Resources

Candidates must have access to the candidate assessment pack and any necessary
resources, as specified in the detailed task tables within the candidate pack.

Collaboration

Group work is not allowed. Candidates must complete all tasks individually.

Supervision

All tasks in this unit are taken under indirect supervision:

Type

Description

Candidates do not need to be directly supervised at all times.

Indirect

•

The centre must ensure that:
•  all candidates participate in the assessment
•

there is sufficient supervision to ensure that work can be
authenticated
the work an individual candidate submits for assessment is his/her
own.

Candidates' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be
stored securely between timetabled sessions.

Centres must have in place systems to ensure candidates cannot access evidence they
have been developing outside of supervised activities.

Authentication

Supervision must be in place to ensure the authenticity of evidence produced for summative
assessment.

You should not provide input or guidance to candidates during the assessment time. This
includes providing formative feedback on the evidence being produced. You can provide
guidance on the requirements of the task and remind candidates of the mark bands and how
they can be interpreted.

Candidates can review and redraft evidence independently within the time controls for the
assessment.

Candidates must sign the declaration to confirm that all evidence submitted for moderation is
their own work and that any sources used have been acknowledged.

Assessors must sign the declaration to confirm that evidence submitted for moderation was
completed under the controlled conditions set out in this assessment.

Candidate evidence

The acceptable formats for evidence of each of the tasks is summarised in the task tables.
Any modified assessment must enable the candidate to generate the evidence required in
this table

Task marking

WJEC will mark all evidence produced by candidates.

Centres must ensure that a candidate cover sheet (included in the candidate assessment
pack) is completed for every candidate and attached to the front of the candidate’s work.

Centres must also ensure that candidates complete a candidate declaration form; this is
included in the candidate assessment pack.

Assessment details

For this assessment learners are required to investigate a business that operates in their
locality. The business they investigate can be a local scale business only operating in the
locality or a national or global business that has a presence in the locality.

Learners will be required to undertake research on their chosen business and to use their
research findings to produce a report. Part A of the report will be compulsory, but for part B
WJEC will select two themes from the specification content (Business ethics, Business and
the environment and Business and Technology) and centres and/or learners will choose one
of the selected themes.

The assignment, featuring the two selected themes and the associated tasks, will be
released during the first week of September for assessment for that academic year and will
change annually. Centres have the flexibility to decide when, during the assessment year,
learners undertake the assignment.

This assessment contributes to 15% of the overall qualification grade and will take 5 hours to
complete. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions.
The assignment will be marked out of a total of 48 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be set and marked
by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be hand written and scanned,
or completed digitally).

The two themes selected each year from the specification content are shown below:

Year of
submission

Choice of theme
(Centres and/or candidates to select one from
the selected themes)

2029

2030

Business and

Business and technology

Business and the

Centres and/or candidates select one theme from the two above to answer Part B of Task 2.

It is important that centres select the topic from the year that they plan to submit the work for
marking as this may be different to the year that the candidates undertake the assessment.

Information for candidates

The following information has been taken from the JCQ Information for candidates – non-
examination assessments and the JCQ Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use in Assessments:
Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications. This tells you about things that you must and must
not do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not
understand, you must ask your teacher.

Preparing your work

•  When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you need to

•

•

ensure that your final product reflects your own independent work and isn’t copied or
paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you must tell
your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
If you worked as part of a group on a task, you must each write up your own account of
the assignment. Even if the data you have is the same, you must describe in your own
words how that data was obtained, and you must independently draw your own
conclusions from the data.

•  Take care of your work and keep it safe. Do not leave it lying around where your

classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You
must always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; do not
share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your
password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
•  Do not be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI

tools and chatbots) – this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort
of copying.

•  You must not write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

Plagiarism

Plagiarism involves taking someone else’s words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them
off as your own. It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously. Don’t think you
won’t be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:
•  Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
•  Markers are highly experienced subject specialists – they may have read the source you

•

are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!
Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match
phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and
style of writing or punctuation.

Penalties for breaking the regulations

the piece of work will be awarded zero marks

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be
applied:
•
•  you will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question
•  you will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series
•  you will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of

time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

Remember – it’s your qualification so it needs to be your own work.

question(s) and computer-generated content for reference and authentication purposes, in a noneditable format (such as a
screenshot) and provide a brief explanation of how it has been used.  This must be submitted with your work, so your
teacher/assessor is able to review the work, the AI-generated content and how it has been used.
