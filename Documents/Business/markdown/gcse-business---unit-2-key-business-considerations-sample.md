|  | Candidates' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be stored securely between timetabled sessions. |  |  |  |  |  |

Centres must have in place systems to ensure candidates cannot access evidence they have been developing outside of supervised activities.

#### **Authentication**

Supervision must be in place to ensure the authenticity of evidence produced for summative assessment.

You should not provide input or guidance to candidates during the assessment time. This includes providing formative feedback on the evidence being produced. You can provide guidance on the requirements of the task and remind candidates of the mark bands and how they can be interpreted.

Candidates can review and redraft evidence independently within the time controls for the assessment.

Candidates must sign the declaration to confirm that all evidence submitted for moderation is their own work and that any sources used have been acknowledged.

Assessors must sign the declaration to confirm that evidence submitted for moderation was completed under the controlled conditions set out in this assessment.

#### **Candidate evidence**

The acceptable formats for evidence of each of the tasks is summarised in the task tables. Any modified assessment must enable the candidate to generate the evidence required in this table

#### **Task marking**

WJEC will mark all evidence produced by candidates.

Centres **must** ensure that a candidate cover sheet (included in the candidate assessment pack) is completed for every candidate and attached to the front of the candidate's work.

Centres **must** also ensure that candidates complete a candidate declaration form; this is included in the candidate assessment pack.

{5}------------------------------------------------

#### **Notes on the completion of the Candidate Declaration Form**

#### <span id="page-6-0"></span>Assessment details

For this assessment learners are required to investigate a business that operates in their locality. The business they investigate can be a local scale business only operating in the locality or a national or global business that has a presence in the locality.

Learners will be required to undertake research on their chosen business and to use their research findings to produce a report. Part A of the report will be compulsory, but for part B WJEC will select two themes from the specification content (Business ethics, Business and the environment and Business and Technology) and centres and/or learners will choose **one** of the selected themes.

The assignment, featuring the two selected themes and the associated tasks, will be released during the first week of September for assessment for that academic year and will change annually. Centres have the flexibility to decide when, during the assessment year, learners undertake the assignment.

This assessment contributes to 15% of the overall qualification grade and will take 5 hours to complete. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions. The assignment will be marked out of a total of 48 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be set and marked by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be hand written and scanned, or completed digitally).

The two themes selected each year from the specification content are shown below:

| Year of submission | Choice of theme (Centres and/or candidates to select one from the selected themes) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| 2026 | Ethics | Business and the environment |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2027 | Business and technology | Ethics |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2028 | Business and the environment | Business and technology |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2029 | Ethics | Business and the environment |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2030 | Business and technology | Ethics |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Centres and/or candidates select **one** theme from the two above to answer Part B of Task 2.

It is important that centres select the topic from the year that they plan to submit the work for marking as this may be different to the year that the candidates undertake the assessment.

#### Information for candidates

The following information has been taken from the [JCQ Information for candidates](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) – non[examination assessments](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) and the [JCQ Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) Use in Assessments:](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/)  [Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/) This tells you about things that you **must** and **must not** do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not understand, you **must** ask your teacher.

#### **Preparing your work**

- When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you need to ensure that your final product reflects your own independent work and isn't copied or paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
- If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you **must** tell your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
- If you worked as part of a group on a task, you **must** each write up your own account of the assignment. Even if the data you have is the same, you **must** describe in your own words how that data was obtained, and you **must** independently draw your own conclusions from the data.
- Take care of your work and keep it safe. **Do not** leave it lying around where your classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You **must** always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; **do not** share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
- **Do not** be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI tools and chatbots) – this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort of copying.
- You **must not** write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

#### **Plagiarism**

Plagiarism involves taking someone else's words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them off as your own. **It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously.** Don't think you won't be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:

- Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
- Markers are highly experienced subject specialists they may have read the source you are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!
- Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and style of writing or punctuation.

#### **Penalties for breaking the regulations**

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be applied:

- the piece of work will be awarded zero marks
- you will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question
- you will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series
- you will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

**Remember – it's your qualification so it needs to be your own work.**

#### **Authentication Declaration**

I declare that my work was completed independently and without any assistance beyond that which was permitted. All work is my own, except for any non-original material clearly credited above. This work has not been submitted for any other qualification. I have clearly referenced any sources and any Artificial Intelligence tools used in the work. I understand that false declaration is a form of malpractice.

| Candidate Signature: | Date: |

<span id="page-17-0"></span><sup>1</sup> Where you have used AI tools as a source of information, you must show the name of the AI source used and the date the content was generated. For example: ChatGPT 3.5 [\(https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/\)](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/), 25/01/2023. You must, retain a copy of the question(s) and computer-generated content for reference and authentication purposes, in a noneditable format (such as a screenshot) and provide a brief explanation of how it has been used. This must be submitted with your work, so your teacher/assessor is able to review the work, the AI-generated content and how it has been used.
