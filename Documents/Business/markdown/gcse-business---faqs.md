# General Specification Questions

#### **Q: How is the course structured?**

A: This is a unitised qualification comprised of four units; two examinations (units 1 and 3) and two NEAs (units 2 and 4). Aside from Unit 1, which is an introductory unit, and Unit 4 which is a synoptic unit, there is no hierarchy implied by the order in which the two other units are presented. There is no optionality or tiering.

#### **Q: Have the assessment objectives changed?**

A: Yes. Refer to the specification on the qualification page.

#### **Q: Can learners resit units if they wish to improve their grade?**

A: Candidates may resit an individual unit only once. The better uniform mark score from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade, subject to the terminal rule being satisfied first. If the assessment being re-taken contributes to the 40% terminal rule requirement, the mark for the new assessment will count regardless of previous results in that assessment.

Should candidates wish to resit Unit 1 or Unit 2 in Year 11, whilst completing Units 3 and 4, the terminal rule has been met by Units 3 and 4, hence the better score from the resit will count.

### **Q: When will the assessments for each unit be available?**

A: Units 1 to 3 will be available from 2026. Unit 4 examinations will be available from summer 2027, which is when the full GCSE qualification will first be awarded.

### **Q: Is there a recommended order of delivery of the units?**

A: No. The centre will determine the delivery order of the units, ensuring Unit 1 is taught as the introductory unit and Unit 4 as the synoptic unit.

#### **Q: What is the grading scale and awarding process?**

A: It uses the traditional 8-point A\*-G scale. Awarding follows WJEC's standard processes aligning with regulatory requirements.

#### **Q: What new content is introduced in the new GCSE Business specification compared to the current one?**

A: The new GCSE Business specification introduces several new content areas, reflecting evolving trends in the business world and aligning with the Curriculum for Wales framework. Some key additions include:

Purpose-driven businesses: Learners will examine the characteristics and features of different purpose-driven business models, such as benefit corporations (B Corps), charities, co-operatives, and social enterprises.

Green and circular economy: Learners will develop an understanding of the green and circular economy and its implications for businesses, people, the economy, and the environment.

Deglobalisation: Learners will examine the concept of deglobalisation and its potential implications for businesses operating in a globalised world.

Evolving job market trends: The specification emphasises the exploration of current job market trends in Wales, the UK, and globally, considering the impact of the changing workplace on future skills demands.

The specification includes a broader range of technologies used in contemporary business, such as 3D printing, AI, automation, cloud storage, digitization, EPOS, online payment systems, QR codes, robotics, and social media.

Elkington's Triple Bottom Line Model: Learners will apply the model when evaluating entrepreneurial opportunities and their impact on people, the community, society, and the environment

#### **Q: What is the recommended guided learning time for this course?**

A: The specification recommends 120-140 guided learning hours, designed as a 2-year program for learners in Years 10 and 11.

#### **Q: How will the pre-release material for the NEA Units be provided?**

A: The pre-release brief containing the task information for Unit 2 will be made available to centres via the WJEC Portal in September of Year 10. Centres can decide when to distribute it to learners during Year 10. The brief for Unit 4 will be made available to centres via the WJEC Portal in September of Year 11.

## Unit 1 – Examination

### **Q: What are the key content areas covered in Unit 1?**

A: Key areas include business fundamentals, careers in business, different scales of business activity, stakeholders, business ownership, the supply chain, location, and revenue, costs and breakeven.

## **Q: Will WJEC provide resources to support teaching and learning?**

A: WJEC has developed Guidance for Teaching (GfT) resources for each unit, accessible through the WJEC subject page. The GfT provides teachers with planned classroom activities and resource links for existing and new content. In addition, Blended Learning resources have been developed for the new specification, available on the WJEC site.

## Unit 2 – NEA

#### **Q: How do learners choose a business in their local area to investigate?**

A: The key consideration is the research information necessary for learners to complete the tasks. Refer to the sample assessment material for guidance.

#### **Q: How is the assessment structured?**

A: Part A will remain the same for lifetime of the qualification. It requires learners to summarise the operations of the chosen business, explain the impact society has on the business and analyse the impact of the business on society.

In Part B, WJEC will select two themes from the specification content (Business ethics, Business and the environment and Business and Technology) and centres and/or learners will choose one of the selected themes to investigate. It is up to the centre to decide whether to give learners a choice over which of the two themes to investigate, or whether all learners investigate the same theme. The centre will need to teach the content of the theme(s) which learners are investigating.

#### **Q: How do learners undertake research?**

A: Centres should teach learners to carry out primary and secondary research. Learners will need to use appropriate forms of research, such as questionnaires, interviews and secondary research logs to identify and present their research opportunity.

## **Q: Should learners use IT software to present their research?**

A: It is not necessary for learners to use IT software. If the assessment is completed by hand, it will need to be scanned prior to being uploaded to IAMIS.

#### **Q: Will centres be supported in how to assess Unit 4 NEA?**

A: In Spring 2026, WJEC will provide 'Preparing to Assess' online events for internally assessed and externally moderated units.
