**12.** Active Fitness is a gym located in Wrexham. It is owned by Fiona and operated as a sole trader business. Fiona, a qualified fitness instructor, started the business 3 years ago. She previously worked for a well-known national gym. Fiona invested £100 000 of her own money to start the business.

Fiona is hard-working and works very long hours. She believes it is worth it because she is passionate about encouraging people of all ages and abilities to get fit and improve their health and wellbeing.

Fiona has developed an excellent reputation in the local area for offering a high-quality gym with friendly and supportive experiences for a wide range of different customers.

Demand for the gym has increased and the gym is often full, with all the fitness equipment being used most of the time. Fiona has also had to employ more fitness trainers to keep up with the growing demand for personal (one-to-one) classes and popular activities such as bootcamp classes, box fit classes and body tone classes. Fiona is also aware that she needs to update the gym equipment to make sure she has the latest fitness technology available to her customers.

Fiona previously worked with Tomas, an experienced personal trainer. Tomas would like to go into business with Fiona, creating a new private limited company. Tomas has offered to invest £100 000 to become an equal shareholder. Fiona is unsure whether she should accept the offer from Tomas.

#### **MARK SCHEME**

#### **Guidance for examiners**

#### **Generic marking principles**

- Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
- Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.
- Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
- Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

#### **Positive marking**

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising candidates for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates' answers. The list is not exhaustive. The inclusion of *'Credit any other valid response.*' (or similar instruction) within mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates' responses. Credit should be given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates' answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However, unless there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks where the answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

#### **Banded mark schemes**

For band marked questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in candidates' answers. It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate's response. As noted above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive and candidates do not have to include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been provided, no marks should be awarded.

{17}------------------------------------------------

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each candidate's response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills, knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors or omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate's answer to pick out the evidence that is being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied. This is done as a two-stage process.

#### **Stage 1 – Deciding on the band**

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate's answer and check whether it matches the descriptors for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the descriptors most closely matches the work.

#### **Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark**

Having determined the appropriate band, deciding on the mark within a band will be made on the basis of a 'best fit' procedure, weaknesses in some areas being compensated for by strengths in others.

Examiners should use the full range of marks available to them. Marking should be positive, rewarding achievement rather that penalising failure or omissions. The awarding of marks must be directly related to the marking criteria, and all responses must be marked according to the banded levels provided for each question.

Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be provided during standardising and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work. Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the standardising material as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the work submitted.

This mark scheme instructs examiners to look for and reward valid alternatives where indicative content is suggested for an answer. This is not a checklist for expected content in an answer, or set out as a 'model answer', as responses must be marked in the banded levels of response provided for each question. Where a candidate provides a response that contains aspects or approaches not included in the indicative content, examiners should use their professional judgement to determine the validity of the response in light of the task and reward as directed by the bands. Candidates are free to choose any approach that is relevant to the set task. Candidates can (and will most likely) incorporate ideas other than those mentioned in the mark scheme.

**12.** Active Fitness is a gym located in Wrexham. It is owned by Fiona and operated as a sole trader business. Fiona, a qualified fitness instructor, started the business 3 years ago. She previously worked for a well-known national gym. Fiona invested £100 000 of her own money to start the business.

Fiona is hard-working and works very long hours. She believes it is worth it because she is passionate about encouraging people of all ages and abilities to get fit and improve their health and wellbeing.

Fiona has developed an excellent reputation in the local area for offering a high-quality gym with friendly and supportive experiences for a wide range of different customers.

Demand for the gym has increased and the gym is often full, with all the fitness equipment being used most of the time. Fiona has also had to employ more fitness trainers to keep up with the growing demand for personal (one-to-one) classes and popular activities such as bootcamp classes, box fit classes and body tone classes. Fiona is also aware that she needs to update the gym equipment to make sure she has the latest fitness technology available to her customers.

Fiona previously worked with Tomas, an experienced personal trainer. Tomas would like to go into business with Fiona, creating a new private limited company. Tomas has offered to invest £100 000 to become an equal shareholder. Fiona is unsure whether she should accept the offer from Tomas.

| (a) | Explain why Fiona became an entrepreneur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |  |   |  |   |  |

|     | Award two<br>marks for a more developed explanation of<br>why Fiona became an entrepreneur, for example:<br>•<br>Fiona will be able to earn a much higher income as<br>an entrepreneur than working for a well-known gym,<br>as she will receive all the profits. |  |   |  |   |  |

- Fiona will lose her complete control of the business.
- The profits now have to be shared and could cause disagreements.
- As a private limited company Fiona will have to publish her accounts.
- The legal process takes time and costs money to set up.
