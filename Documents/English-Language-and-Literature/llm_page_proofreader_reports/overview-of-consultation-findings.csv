0,3,have decided,Qualifications Wales **have decided** that these qualifications will be introduced in a phased way; WJEC is now developing the qualifications that are to be available for first teaching from September 2025 to meet these requirements.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The subject 'Qualifications Wales' refers to a singular entity (an organisation), and therefore requires the singular verb 'has decided' for subject-verb agreement."
1,4,around the concerns raised,The subject-specific section of the report goes into further detail **around the concerns raised**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"For formal writing, 'regarding' or 'about' is generally preferred over 'around' in this context."
2,4,around the level of content,The comments made indicated that the concern here was **around the level of content** that we must include in our qualification.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"For formal writing, 'regarding' or 'about' is generally preferred over 'around' in this context."
3,4,links to learners undertaking,"A notable area of concern in consultation responses and discussions with stakeholder groups **links to learners undertaking** non-examination assessment across a number of subjects, and the potential negative impact this could have on learner wellbeing.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing 'links to' is less formal; 'is linked to' or 'concerns' would be more appropriate for a formal report.
4,4,nonexamination,This was particularly prevalent in qualifications where the **nonexamination** assessment is either new or significantly increased.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The compound adjective 'non-examination' requires a hyphen in British English.
5,5,as meaning equitable access,"Welsh Government's guidance on well-being, equity and inclusion [\(https://hwb.gov.wales/evaluation-improvement-andaccountability/the-national-resource-evaluation-and-improvement/what-is-the-nationalresource/well-being-equity-and-inclusion/\)](https://hwb.gov.wales/evaluation-improvement-and-accountability/the-national-resource-evaluation-and-improvement/what-is-the-national-resource/well-being-equity-and-inclusion/) describes equity **as meaning equitable access** to opportunities to perform in assessments, access to the same materials and spaces, unbiased assessment tasks, preventing prejudice or stereotyping and allowing students to access the assessment regardless of their background.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The word 'meaning' is redundant here; 'describes equity as equitable access' would be more concise and professional.
6,5,nonexamination,"Some stakeholders felt that **nonexamination** assessment can further disadvantage some learners, for example, those who do not have support or access to adequate resources at home.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The compound adjective 'non-examination' requires a hyphen in British English.
7,5,noted that they felt that,"Respondents **noted that they felt that** appropriate controls should be in place to ensure that all schools assess fairly, or there could be a lack of confidence in qualification results which would consequently mean learner attainment would have less value associated with it.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing is wordy; 'noted that appropriate controls should be in place' or 'felt that appropriate controls should be in place' would be more concise.
8,5,Artificial Intelligence,"In our discussions, it was also noted that an increase in non-examination assessment weighting could potentially raise the likelihood and incentive for malpractice, and several respondents noted a concern about **Artificial Intelligence** and its monitoring, with a fear that low controls could make the use of **Artificial Intelligence** difficult to monitor, threatening fairness for learners.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"As a general term, 'artificial intelligence' should typically be lowercase in British English unless it is part of a proper noun or specific product name."
9,5,maximalise,"However, one stakeholder group had a different view on what impacted equity, requesting that the GCSEs have a range of assessment methods, focusing on competency-based continuous assessment methods, rather than coursework or mini-tests, to **maximalise** equity.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,'Maximalise' is not a standard British English word; 'maximise' (or 'maximize' in US English) should be used.
10,5,Qualification Wales,"When we submit our qualifications to **Qualification Wales** for approval, we must stipulate how we have managed the balance of manageability, engagement, reliability and validity.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"'Qualifications Wales' is a proper noun and should consistently be plural, as used elsewhere in the document."
11,6,around digital submission,"While some positive comments were made **around digital submission** where learner work has been produced digitally, respondents expressed a concern linked to teacher workload and centre manageability where the infrastructure isn't available to schools to enable the work to be produced digitally by learners in the first place.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"For formal writing, 'regarding' or 'about' is generally preferred over 'around' in this context."
12,6,isn't,"While some positive comments were made around digital submission where learner work has been produced digitally, respondents expressed a concern linked to teacher workload and centre manageability where the infrastructure **isn't** available to schools to enable the work to be produced digitally by learners in the first place.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,Contractions like 'isn't' are generally avoided in formal reports; 'is not' is preferred.
13,6,nonexamination,"Where this is the case, scanning and uploading of **nonexamination** assessment could be time-consuming, particularly when considering the scale of non-examination assessment across the suite of qualifications.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The compound adjective 'non-examination' requires a hyphen in British English.
14,6,in the Spring,We are undertaking further focused work to explore in more detail and will clarify our expectations **in the Spring**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,Seasons are generally not capitalised in British English unless personified or part of a proper noun.
15,6,around a lack of infrastructure,Respondents also expressed concerns **around a lack of infrastructure** in schools to support digital examination assessment.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"For formal writing, 'regarding' or 'about' is generally preferred over 'around' in this context."
16,6,around their ability,"Some of the comments made indicated that the number of hours allocated to some subjects differed significantly to the guided learning hours, and this raised concerns **around their ability** to cover the content in the time they were allocated by their school.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"For formal writing, 'regarding' or 'about' is generally preferred over 'around' in this context."
17,6,around this aspect,More detail **around this aspect** can be found in relevant subject-specific sections.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"For formal writing, 'regarding' or 'about' is generally preferred over 'around' in this context."
18,6,around re-sits,"A number of Further Education providers raised concerns **around re-sits**, with particular concerns relating to Mathematics and Numeracy, and English Language and Literature.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"For formal writing, 'regarding' or 'about' is generally preferred over 'around' in this context."
19,8,on or volume of work,"A couple of respondents proposed setting limits on the time spent **on or volume of work** to be submitted for the portfolio; however, after consulting further with stakeholders via our Development Advisory Group, we have decided not to proceed with this but to retain the current flexibility.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The preposition 'on' applies to 'time spent' but does not grammatically connect to 'volume of work' in this construction, creating an awkward and incorrect phrasing. It should be 'on the time spent or the volume of work'."
20,9,states,The Approval Criteria **states** that 30% of the qualification must be assessed by external examination which must include questions on unprepared works.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"The noun 'Criteria' is plural, so the verb should be 'state' to maintain subject-verb agreement."
21,10,that the assessment approach is appropriate,"Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed assessment approach is appropriate, that the unit purposes are appropriate and engaging for learners and meet the qualification purpose and aims, and **that the assessment approach is appropriate**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"The phrase 'that the assessment approach is appropriate' is repeated unnecessarily, making the sentence less concise."
22,10,linked to this aspect,Our specification writers are being guided on the number of Guided Learning Hours per unit to ensure that the content is teachable in the time and we will strengthen our focus on reviewing manageability **linked to this aspect**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing 'linked to this aspect' is somewhat clunky; 'in relation to this aspect' or 'of this aspect' would be more formal and concise.
23,11,around,Some concerns were raised **around** the number of non-examination assessments.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"In formal writing, 'about' is generally preferred when referring to a topic or subject, whereas 'around' implies physical proximity."
24,11,the Unit 1,"Consequently, we have changed the title of **the Unit 1** to 'Our physical and human world'.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The definite article 'the' is not typically used before 'Unit' when followed by a number in this context.
25,11,out,"Consequently, we have removed the reference to exploring fieldwork in learners' locality, to widen **out** the area that learners can explore.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,88,'Widen' is sufficient; 'out' is redundant and makes the phrasing less formal.
26,11,being mindful of,"We propose to explore this further in the next stage of development **being mindful of** fairness, the ability to differentiate, coverage and the need for reading time.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,'Mindful of' is more concise and equally clear in this context.
27,11,submission we,Following feedback on digital **submission we** will be exploring this further at the next stage of development.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,A comma is required after the introductory participial phrase 'Following feedback on digital submission' for improved clarity.

29,13,was manageable,Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed qualification structure and assessment approach is appropriate and that the proposed qualification **was manageable** for learners.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,Inconsistent tense with the preceding clauses ('is appropriate'); 'is manageable' would maintain present tense consistency for the proposed qualification.
30,13,of a range of abilities,Some respondents were encouraged by the introduction of non-examination assessment and felt it would help all learners **of a range of abilities**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing is slightly awkward; 'with a range of abilities' or 'across a range of abilities' would be more natural and clearer.
31,13,as positive as it allowed,The introduction of non-examination assessment into Religious Studies was seen by some **as positive as it allowed** the subject to align with other humanities qualifications and provided equal opportunity across humanities subjects.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,"The repetition of 'as' makes the sentence slightly awkward; 'as positive because it allowed' or 'as positive, as it allowed' would improve clarity."
32,13,and on non-religious,This was not the intention – the qualification will place equal value on religious **and on non-religious** beliefs and philosophical convictions.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The second 'on' is redundant after 'religious and', creating an unnecessary repetition."
33,13,convictions learners could study,"Linked to this, some concerns were raised about optionality and that there was a lack of clarity surrounding the religious and non-religious beliefs and philosophical **convictions learners could study**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,Adding 'that' before 'learners could study' would improve the grammatical flow and clarity of the sentence.
34,13,states,"The Approval Criteria from Qualifications Wales **states** that learners must develop knowledge and understanding of Christianity (or Catholic Christianity) and at least one other religion to be chosen from the following list: Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and Sikhism (Sikhi).",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"Subject-verb agreement: 'Approval Criteria' is a plural subject, so the verb should be 'state', not 'states'."

36,13,in the time,Our specification writers are being guided on the number of Guided Learning Hours per unit to ensure that the content is teachable **in the time**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,70,'In the time' is slightly informal; 'within the allocated time' or 'within the teaching time available' would be more appropriate for formal writing.
37,14,i.e.,"• Relating to the specific units, some respondents felt there were repeated topics **i.e.** human rights, with some respondents questioning why a religious studies qualification was teaching human rights.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,'i.e.' (that is) is used incorrectly; 'e.g.' (for example) would be more appropriate here to introduce an example.
38,14,nonreligious,"Unit 3 – Human experience and the world focuses on how environmental issues are approached by people with different religious and/or **nonreligious** beliefs, whereas, Unit 4 – Human rights focuses on ethical/moral, human rights issues from religious and non-religious perspectives.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,95,"Inconsistent hyphenation; 'non-religious' was used consistently elsewhere in the document (e.g., page 13)."

40,14,states,"Human rights have historically been an area of study within religious studies, and the Approval Criteria from Qualifications Wales **states** that human rights must be explored through the unique subject lens of religious studies.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"Subject-verb agreement: 'Approval Criteria' is a plural subject, so the verb should be 'state', not 'states'."

Clarification is needed (e.g., 'non-examination assessment tasks for Units 2 and 3')."
42,14,Unit 2 and 3 of the non-examination tasks,"Consequently, we have decided to change the release dates of **Unit 2 and 3 of the non-examination tasks** to May of the first year of study, thus giving learners and teachers more time to prepare.",ErrorCategory.AMBIGUOUS_PHRASING,85,"The phrasing is ambiguous; it could mean tasks for Unit 2 and tasks for Unit 3, or tasks for Unit 2 and Unit 3 combined. Clarification is needed (e.g., 'non-examination tasks for Units 2 and 3')."
43,15,understanding and use of the language,- the emphasis on **understanding and use of the language** in a spontaneous and confident manner,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,70,The phrasing 'understanding and use' is slightly abrupt; 'understanding and using the language' or 'understanding and the use of the language' would improve flow and parallelism.
44,15,in the time,Our specification writers are being guided on the number of Guided Learning Hours per unit to ensure that the content is teachable **in the time**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,70,'In the time' is slightly informal; 'within the allocated time' or 'within the teaching time available' would be more appropriate for formal writing.

47,16,represent,Our specification writer for this unit is aware of the concerns and we will aim to include writing that **represent** a variety of perspectives reflecting the diverse nature of Welsh citizenship and its cultures in order to make the unit interesting and relevant to learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The subject 'writing' is singular, so the verb should be 'represents' to maintain subject-verb agreement."
48,17,more of an authentic,"This amendment will allow the translanguaging task to be **more of an authentic** and engaging task for learners, to better prepare learners for the world of work and beyond.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'a more authentic' is more concise and stylistically preferred in British English.
49,17,set text,"In response, we are exploring opportunities to add **set text** to Unit 2 and Unit 4. This would help ensure the study of a range of literature whilst promoting flexibility and choice for centres in terms of topics, themes, and diversity.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"Given the context of 'a variety of literary works' and 'a range of literature', 'set texts' (plural) is more appropriate."
50,18,and of non-fiction,"We propose to curate anthologies of poetry **and of non-fiction** texts to support teachers in both classroom delivery and preparation for assessment – these will be relevant to the examined Units 1 and 6, and to the non-examination assessment in Units 3 and 5.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,"The second 'of' is redundant and can be omitted for conciseness, making it 'anthologies of poetry and non-fiction texts'."
51,18,the comparison of two unseen poems in Unit 1 and Unit 3 requires the comparison of two poems,The current GCSE English Literature qualification requires the assessment of poetry in two units: **the comparison of two unseen poems in Unit 1 and Unit 3 requires the comparison of two poems** from fifteen specified poems listed for study.,ErrorCategory.AMBIGUOUS_PHRASING,90,"The sentence structure is confusing, making it unclear what the subject of 'requires' is and how 'Unit 1' and 'Unit 3' relate to the two comparisons."
52,18,different,"Furthermore, the nature of the tasks in the different units will be **different**, with analysis/comparison assessed in the examination, and poetry used as a vehicle for the oracy task in Unit 5, which will focus on the discussion of attitudes rather than literary analysis.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,The repetition of 'different' can be avoided for better stylistic flow; consider 'will vary' or 'will differ'.
53,18,were considered,"The length of the examinations for Units 1, 4 and 6 **were considered** by some respondents to be too long.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The subject 'length' is singular, so the verb should be 'was considered' to maintain subject-verb agreement."

56,19,equally split response,We asked stakeholders for their preference for a 4- or 5-unit structure and received an **equally split response**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrase 'equally split response' is informal; 'evenly split response' or 'a response that was equally divided' would be more appropriate for formal writing.
