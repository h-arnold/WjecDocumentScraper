1,8,are still __________ and __________ on,Mai recognises that Jamaican families **are still __________ and __________ on** the difficulties of her own family's past.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The sentence structure implies a compound predicate for the plural subject 'Jamaican families'. However, the provided singular verb options ('reflects', 'looks') do not agree with a plural subject, making the sentence grammatically incorrect or highly ambiguous for the student to complete."
2,15,"Or,","Answer one of the following:

#### **Either**

**5.** Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore to what extent Phil controls one or two of the other characters in the play. Remember to support your answer with reference to the play. You should comment on the play's contexts.

**Or,**

**6.** ""The need to belong is what drives the characters' behaviour in the play.""",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The comma after 'Or' is grammatically incorrect when presenting alternatives in this heading format; it should either be 'Or' or 'Or:'.
3,24,window,"Leon sees ""Fat arms of white fire curl out of the broken **window** and<br>wave at him"".",ErrorCategory.FACTUAL_INACCURACY,100,The quote provided in question 10(a)(i) uses 'window' while the preceding extract uses 'windows'.
4,26,driving-force,"Hope is the **driving-force** for Leon's behaviour in the novel."" Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore how far you agree with this statement.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"The compound noun 'driving force' is typically written as two words in British English, not hyphenated."
5,29,Didn't deep down believe his own stories about Gwyn.,"Pigeon looks at Cher, and thinks it's strange how it's all happened, thinks how Cher believed it all, every word, and he didn't, not deep down. **Didn't deep down believe his own stories about Gwyn.**",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"This is a sentence fragment, lacking an explicit subject, and should either be joined to the preceding sentence or rephrased with a subject."
6,29,come on…,"“Tyrd!” Gwyn says, over and over, **come on…**",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,85,"The phrase 'come on…' is an explanation or translation of 'Tyrd!' and requires proper punctuation (e.g., an em dash or parentheses) to separate it from the preceding clause."
7,40,You are advised to spend about 40 minutes on 19 or 20.,You are advised to spend about 40 minutes on **19** or **20**. **You are advised to spend about 40 minutes on 19 or 20.** [25],ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,95,"This sentence is a direct repetition of the preceding sentence, making it redundant."
8,40,"Or,","**19** Write a story with the title: An unexpected achievement. **Or,** **20** Write about a time when you, or somebody else, made a friend.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,The comma after 'Or' is superfluous when 'Or' is used as a conjunction introducing an alternative option in a list format.
9,44,however;,Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (**however;** the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A semicolon is incorrectly used after 'however' within the parenthetical clause; a comma is required here.

11,45,that,"Marking should be positive, rewarding achievement rather **that** penalising failure or omissions.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The phrase 'rather than' is required here; 'that' is a homophone error in this context.
12,45,standardising,Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be provided during **standardising** and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The repetition of 'standardising' is awkward; 'standardisation' would be more appropriate for the noun form in the second instance.

Tick (✓) one box.<br>Award one mark for the correct answer:,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"The subject 'Which one' is singular, requiring the singular verb 'is' instead of 'are' for subject-verb agreement."

Using literary and linguistic approaches, explore how far you agree with this statement.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The term 'driving force' is used inconsistently on this page, appearing as 'driving-force' here and 'driving force' (two words) in subsequent paragraphs.

22,63,play,"Less successful responses will be reliant on narrative with some relevant discussion of events in the **play** that show Leon's behaviour and, perhaps, how this is driven by his hopes.",ErrorCategory.FACTUAL_INACCURACY,95,"The document consistently refers to the text under discussion as a 'novel', making the reference to 'the play' factually incorrect or inconsistent with the rest of the document."
23,72,Paraphrase or general references may be used.,"Less successful answers will be mostly narrative, with some discussion of characters and behaviour that can be seen as innocent or as causing problems. **Paraphrase or general references may be used.** There will be awareness of the novel's context, and, perhaps, empathy, towards the top of this mark range.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,This is a sentence fragment; it lacks a clear subject and main verb to stand as a complete sentence in a descriptive paragraph.
24,73,simple narrative with an awareness,"Less successful responses will be fairly **simple narrative with an awareness** of how Orwell uses the novel as a warning against dangerous human behaviour, perhaps linked to some discussion of relevant context.",ErrorCategory.AMBIGUOUS_PHRASING,85,"The phrasing 'narrative with an awareness' is grammatically awkward and implies the narrative itself possesses awareness, rather than the responses demonstrating it."
25,74,understanding how contexts,"show a full and thorough **understanding how contexts** may inform viewpoints and perspectives, drawing confidently on well-chosen evidence from the text(s).",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A preposition 'of' is required after the noun 'understanding' when followed by a clause introduced by 'how'.
26,74,selection of points offered,"offer a competent **selection of points offered**, and meaningful development of ideas.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The word 'offered' is redundant as 'selection of points' already implies they have been presented.

28,74,"understanding of, with emerging awareness","• show clear **understanding of, with emerging awareness** of their impact.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"The sentence is incomplete and lacks a clear object for 'understanding of', making it grammatically unsound; it likely intends to refer to 'contexts'."
29,78,syntax and errors,Candidates rarely use appropriate grammar and **syntax and errors** may impede meaning.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,A comma should precede the conjunction 'and' when it joins two independent clauses in a compound sentence.
