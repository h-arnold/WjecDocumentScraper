## GCSE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE

## <span id="page-8-0"></span>1. INTRODUCTION

### <span id="page-8-1"></span>1.1 Aims

- appreciate how language connects us to the world around us through engagement with the spoken word and written texts from a range of times, places and cultures
- read and listen to a range of spoken and written texts, considering how language, register and style convey meaning
- understand the significance of purpose, audience, medium and context when communicating, expressing, understanding and responding to language
- express themselves in speaking and writing through clear, accurate, fluent and creative use of English
- develop and apply knowledge and understanding of the vocabulary, grammar and uses of the English language

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales' Approval Criteria.

#### <span id="page-8-2"></span>1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE English Language and Literature qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/languages-literacy-and-communication/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of what matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/languages-literacy-and-communication/statements-of-what-matters/) and those [subject specific skills and concepts](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/languages-literacy-and-communication/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area) outlined in the ['Designing your Curriculum'](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/languages-literacy-and-communication/designing-your-curriculum/) section of the Languages, Literacy and Communication Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted on page 30; the Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery. 

{9}------------------------------------------------

The GCSE English Language and Literature qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:

- supporting the statements of what matters[1](#page-9-1) , giving learners the opportunity to:
  - develop their understanding, empathy and their ability to respond and to mediate effectively
  - interact, explore ideas, express viewpoints, knowledge and understanding and build relationships
  - experience and respond to a variety of diverse literature that gives them insight into the culture, people and history of Wales as well as the wider world
  - spark their imagination and creativity.
- supporting the principles of progression[2](#page-9-2) by giving learners the opportunity to:
  - build on their linguistic skills
  - grow holistically in their understanding and purposeful use of languages, literacy and communication
  - apply their understanding of linguistic concepts
  - adapt and manipulate language to communicate effectively to a range of different audiences
  - develop receptive, interpretive and expressive language skills
  - transfer existing knowledge and skills into new contexts including the social and cultural aspects of language.
- supporting the key considerations for language development and selecting literature[3](#page-9-3) by giving learners the opportunity to:
  - experience relevant, engaging, authentic and challenging stimuli to inspire purposeful speaking and writing
  - experience a wealth of literature.

### <span id="page-9-0"></span>1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of English at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

{10}------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="page-10-0"></span>1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE English Language and Literacy (Single Award) has been designed to be delivered within 120 – 140 guided learning hours.

GCSE English Language and Literacy (Double Award) has been designed to be delivered within 240 – 280 guided learning hours.

Both qualifications have been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

#### <span id="page-10-1"></span>1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

#### <span id="page-10-2"></span>1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website [\(http://www.jcq.org.uk\)](http://www.jcq.org.uk/).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

{11}------------------------------------------------

## <span id="page-11-0"></span>2 SUBJECT CONTENT

#### <span id="page-11-1"></span>How to read the amplification

The amplification provided in the right-hand column uses the following stems:

- 'Learners should understand' is used when learners are required to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding rather than apply their knowledge, understanding and skills
- 'Learners should be able to' is used when learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding and demonstrate application of skills
- 'Learners will be required to' is used to show the specific requirements of individual units.

#### <span id="page-11-2"></span>Integration of Language and Literature

This qualification is an integration of English Language and Literature. As such, it is important to be aware of the following assumptions:

- the term 'literature' is used in its widest sense, to denote all written material regardless of its purpose. It is not intended to infer imaginative works of exclusively poetry, prose or drama.
- learners are required to analyse the literature they study using both linguistic and literary approaches. This makes clear the intention that learners engage with the techniques, devices and features present in literature in order to explore the impact they have and/or how they create meaning, whether those techniques, devices or features be linguistic or literary.
- as part of their learning, it is expected that learners will consider aspects of the English language, using literature as a vehicle for this. Consideration of vocabulary, grammar and syntax are required throughout the course, not only in regard to learners' own writing, but also in regard to the literature selected for study. Knowledge and understanding of the English language will be assessed in examined units; application of skills in the English language will be assessed in all units.

{12}------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="page-12-0"></span>Unit 1 (Single and Double Award)

#### **Context and meaning**

Written Examination: 1 hour 30 minutes Marked by WJEC

60 marks

#### **Overview of unit**

The purpose of this unit is for learners to:

- understand and respond critically to a range of poetry
- write with clarity, adapting for purpose and effect, and using appropriate linguistic features and techniques.

Unit 1 aims to encourage learners to engage with the concept of **Context and Meaning**. Learners are encouraged to draw on their understanding of how meaning is created through the study of poetry and apply this to their own writing. This includes a detailed understanding of the functions of the English language in the creation of poetic meaning. It is an opportunity for learners to understand how language and context influence and impact meaning in literature in order to shape their own writing, using language effectively to present their own ideas. This prepares learners to become more confident in adapting their writing for purpose and effect, making them more effective communicators. The study of **Context and Meaning** will help learners to become ethical, informed citizens of Wales and the world by understanding how context affects individuals and communities, and by enhancing their capacity for critical thinking.

In their study of the WJEC Anthology used in this unit, learners will have opportunities to explore and respond to different contexts, and to consider content and materials that reflect the diversity of our society and the wider world. They will be encouraged to develop creative responses, using their understanding of the writer's craft and writing conventions to inform the construction of their own texts.

{13}------------------------------------------------

#### **Areas of content**

#### **Unit 1: Context and Meaning**

Learners will be required to:

- 1.1 study all poems in the WJEC Poetry Anthology indicated for Unit 1 study, supplemented by additional poems from the 19**th** and 20**th** centuries
- 1.2 respond to linked poems, one that has been studied (from the anthology) and one unseen poem
- 1.3 produce writing that may be creative literary writing or non-fiction writing.

#### Content Amplification 1.1 Study all poems in the WJEC Poetry Anthology indicated for Unit 1 study, supplemented by a wider range of additional poems from the 19th and 20**th** centuries Poems for Unit 1 in the **WJEC Poetry Anthology** will be written by living authors. The anthology provides two poems for study for Unit 1 under each of the following themes: • Relationships • Identity • Conflict • The Natural World • Children and Parents Centres are required to supplement the poems in the anthology with a wider self-selected range of poems from the 19th and 20th century, which cover different forms. These must include sonnet, elegy, ballad and blank verse. To support the concept of **Context and Meaning**, learners must engage with the different contexts that have influenced the studied poetry. Examples of the contexts learners could engage with are: • socio-historical contexts • cultural influences • authorial context • literary context • period • status/power. Alongside these, learners could also consider their own context and its influence on interpretation and response. 1.2 Respond to linked poems, one that has been studied (from the anthology) and one unseen poem. Through the study of poetry, learners should understand: • how language, structure and form contribute to the presentation of information, ideas and themes in written texts and how these have an impact on the reader • how different contexts may inform different viewpoints and perspectives in poetry • how relevant contextual factors shape meaning. Learners should be able to: • understand and respond critically to the studied poetry by exploring poetic forms, styles and devices, themes and different perspectives • analyse and critically evaluate texts and viewpoints • select and evaluate relevant points to illustrate and support interpretations and develop ideas

{14}------------------------------------------------

- comprehend ideas and information, retrieve relevant detail and mediate, through paraphrasing, summarising and interpreting main points
- make comparisons and explain links within and between written texts, synthesising and summarising information, ideas and themes as appropriate
- make inferences and deductions, including identifying viewpoints and purposes
- communicate information, understanding, ideas, opinions and feelings clearly and accurately
- understand and use linguistic and literary terminology
- identify, understand and comment on aspects of language such as vocabulary, parts of speech, idiom, grammar and syntax
- structure responses to support coherence and cohesion.
- 1.3 Produce writing that may be creative literary writing or nonfiction writing.

Through their own writing, learners should be able to:

- demonstrate their understanding of how to write for a specific context, considering the effect of audience, purpose, genre, narrative voice and relevant contextual influences on their writing
- create clear meaning through their language choices and their use of linguistic and literary features
- communicate clearly, effectively and imaginatively, using linguistic and literary techniques, forms and vocabulary that engage the reader
- adapt communication by selecting register, vocabulary and techniques appropriate to different contexts and audiences, using a range of strategies and literary and linguistic techniques to engage and influence readers
- organise communication using a variety of linguistic and structural features to support cohesion and overall coherence
- use a range of sentence structures for clarity, purpose and effect, with appropriate grammar and syntax, and accurate punctuation and spelling.

Through studying poetry, learners will encounter different voices from different places and times which could stimulate their own creative responses even in a different genre.

A choice of writing tasks between creative literary writing and creative non-fiction writing will be offered in the examination. This may be in any of the forms listed, and for a variety of purposes.

Writing tasks could take the form of, but are not limited to:

- newspaper/magazine articles
- reports
- brochures
- instructional guides
- webpages
- blogs
- leaflets
- factsheets

#### <span id="page-16-0"></span>Unit 2 (Single and Double Award)

#### **Belonging**

Non-examination assessment: approximately 7 hours Marked by the centre, moderated by WJEC 60 marks

#### **Overview of unit**

The purpose of this unit is for learners to:

- develop oracy skills
- show understanding of and respond to narrative fictional prose in writing
- conduct research towards an individual oral presentation linked to the studied prose.

Unit 2 encourages learners to engage with the concept of **Belonging**, with a focus on investigating the themes, issues and representations around *cynefin*, community and citizenship in the selected narrative fiction text. Study of **Belonging** will help learners to become ethical, well-informed citizens who are knowledgeable about both their own culture, community, society and world, and those of others, now and in the past.

#### **Areas of content**

#### **Unit 2 Belonging**

Learners will be required to:

- 2.1 study a prose text selected from a comprehensive longlist of suggested texts

#### <span id="page-20-0"></span>Unit 4a (Single Award Only)

#### **Motivations**

Written Examination: Duration 1 hour 30 minutes Marked by WJEC 60 marks

#### **Overview of unit**

The purpose of this unit is for learners to:

- consider the (re)presentation of characters, relationships and communities
- understand written texts in their social, cultural and historical contexts, and how these may inform different viewpoints and perspectives
- understand their own motivations as writers in creating literary texts.

Unit 4a encourages learners to engage with the idea of the **Motivations** of writers and characters in the drama text selected for study, exploring the reasons for attitudes, behaviours and/or beliefs. **Motivations** could be linked to:

- characters' thoughts and behaviours
- cultural/social representation
- the writer's attitudes to social, cultural and historical views and stereotypes
- contextual ideas
- exploring different viewpoints.

Engaging with **Motivations** in literature and with language analysis encourages learners to become more ambitious and capable in their approach to understanding texts and in expressing themselves through language. This includes a detailed understanding of the functions of the English language in the creation of meaning. These experiences foster an appreciation of a writer's craft, and develop learners' own creative skills. Learners acquire a more nuanced understanding of different viewpoints and the skills needed to interpret, evaluate and respond to differing perspectives. This, along with contextual knowledge to support their understanding of the selected text, will allow learners to develop their ability to demonstrate empathy, developing their own emotional intelligence and awareness by considering the impact of the **Motivations** behind behaviour, speech and actions. The production of creative writing in this unit will engage learners as readers, narrators and creators of their own work, inspired by literature. Learners will generate their own creative ideas, plan and organise work. This unit will support learners to become unbiased and critically aware interpreters of what they hear, read and see through enhanced understanding of their own and other people's experiences, beliefs and cultures.

- make connections relating to time, place, space, setting, language and/ or relationships.

Learners will explore **Connections** and links between texts they read, hear and produce in this unit. **Connections** may be social, relational, temporal and/or linguistic, and may also be between the genre, meaning and purpose of texts. This includes a detailed understanding of the functions of the English language in the creation of meaning. By exploring **Connections** between language that is read, heard, seen and produced, learners are encouraged to become more ambitious and capable in their understanding of texts and in expressing themselves through language. These experiences encourage learners to develop understanding of different viewpoints and perspectives, and to become effective communicators.

#### **Areas of content**

#### **Unit 6: Connections**

Learners will be required to:

- 6.1 study a prescribed anthology of non-fiction writing provided by WJEC
- 6.2 explore connections between the Non-Fiction Anthology text(s) and an unseen text
- 6.3 produce non-fiction writing.

{34}------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="page-34-0"></span>3.2 Overview of arrangements for non-examination assessment

Non-examination assessment units in this qualification will be marked by the centre and moderated by WJEC. Tasks and associated stimuli will be released during the first week of April for first assessment the following academic year and the same question will remain for two years. Centres are required to ensure they use the correct question for each series. . Assessments must be submitted digitally – written assessments may be handwritten and scanned, or completed digitally; oracy assessments must be recorded audio-visually and uploaded.

#### Unit 2

Both tasks in this unit are based on the concept of **Belonging** developing learners' self-identity and empathy, fostering inclusivity, and helping them understand the impact of community and acceptance. This unit aims for learners to engage with this concept through the study of a prose text as well as through an oral presentation.

The assessment contributes 20% (Single Award) / 10% (Double Award) to the overall qualification and will take approximately 7 hours to complete.

#### Task A

Learners will use a range of linguistic and literary approaches to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the whole text, exploring the theme of **Belonging** through the study of character(s) and setting. The suggested length of response is 750-1000 words.

WJEC will publish a choice of stimuli for this task based on aspects of **Belonging** that are relevant to the novels on the longlist. These will be published in the first week of April for use in the following academic year and will be changed every two years.

Task A will assess AO1 and AO2.

#### Task B

Task B requires learners to complete an individually researched oral presentation linked to their understanding of **Belonging** developed through their literary study for Task A. The presentation should be linked to a theme, issue, representation or relationship inspired by the studied prose text that interests them.

Learners will develop oracy skills and conduct research towards an individual oral presentation inspired by the studied prose text.

Task B will assess mainly AO2, but also the learner's ability to conduct research to inform understanding of a topic and consider and comment on the reliability and validity of sources and evidence (AO1).

Parameters for task-setting will be set by WJEC, along with examples of tasks that may be used or modified by centres. Teachers should ensure that tasks are suitable for learners to demonstrate the required knowledge, skills and understanding.

{35}------------------------------------------------

#### Unit 3

All tasks in this unit are based on the concept of **Influence and Power** as outlined in the specification.

Developing an understanding of how a reader or listener can be influenced encourages learners to explore and challenge ideas presented to them and to raise healthy, questioning debate. In preparation for Task A, learners will be able to understand the role of power, and explore how writers and speakers attempt to influence their audiences. Learners will be able to acknowledge how others have shaped their views.

This unit aims to engage learners to engage with this concept through the teaching and learning of selected texts on a range of themes. Learners will be expected to identify and explore the effects of **Influence and Power** in what they have read, and use these strategies in their own communication.

Learners will be expected to use a range of linguistic and literary approaches in their responses to all tasks.

The assessment contributes 20% (Single Award) / 10% (Double Award) to the overall qualification and will take approximately 5 hours 55 minutes to complete.

#### Task A

Task A requires learners to participate in a group discussion of 6-10 minutes. For the purposes of this task, a group is defined as 3-4 learners.

WJEC will publish a choice from two selected themes as the discussion stimuli for this task, along with one prescribed text to be used in the discussion for each selection. Centres must ensure the following are used:

- one text from the anthology prescribed by WJEC for the chosen theme
- one further text from the anthology must be used
- at least one of the texts referenced in the discussion must be non-continuous.

Learners may include a third text from within or outside the anthology. This could be the non-continuous text.

The stimuli and prescribed texts will be published in the first week of April for first assessment the following academic year and will change every two years.

The discussion will require learners to provide evidence for their response to the stimulus, and/or their argument/counterargument through reference to the texts.

Task A will assess AO2 and AO1.

#### Task B

Task B requires learners to complete a piece of creative non-fiction writing. The suggested length is 400-500 words. The work must be a written text designed to be spoken (e.g. a speech, talk, vlog, podcast, advice piece, oral guidance). A choice of tasks will be set by WJEC – these will be published in the first week of April for first assessment the following academic year and will be changed every two years.

{36}------------------------------------------------

Using a range of linguistic and literary approaches, learners will apply their knowledge and understanding of the ways of influencing a reader or listener and/or of demonstrating power in a writer/speaker/audience relationship, using ideas, opinions and techniques which they have explored in their reading of texts from the anthology.

Task B will assess AO2 only.

#### Unit 5

Both tasks in this unit are based on the concept of **Continuity and Change** as outlined in the specification. The unit aims to engage learners with this concept through the study of a whole play by William Shakespeare and a range of poems, one of which must be from the 1600-1900 period. The texts selected should allow learners to identify and explore examples of continuity and change, to make connections, and to consider attitudes, contextual factors, and audience/reader responses. Learners will be expected to select and use a range of linguistic and literary approaches to communicate their responses to the texts.

The assessment contributes 20% to the Double Award qualification and will take approximately 8 hours to complete.

#### Task A

Task A requires learners to complete an extended response with a suggested length of 1000 -1500 words, based on the study of a whole play by Shakespeare chosen by the centre.

A choice of tasks based on different aspects of **Continuity and Change** will be published by WJEC in the first week of April for assessment for the following academic year. Tasks will be changed every two years.

Learners will write about the whole play using linguistic and literary approaches to show understanding of developments in plot and character, to explore themes, to analyse language and structure, to engage with changes in attitudes and ideas over time, and to comment on changes in language use over time. They must also consider the context of the play and the way contextual factors inform their reading.

Learners can be encouraged to watch live/recorded performances of the chosen play to develop their understanding. However, this must not be a substitute for studying the whole text.

Task A will assess AO1 and AO2.

#### Task B

Task B requires learners to undertake a paired discussion based on the study of one prescribed 1600-1900 poem from the WJEC Anthology and a further poem selected by the learner from the anthology or an additional self-selected poem. Learners may include a third poem in the discussion if they wish.

WJEC will publish a choice of stimuli for the discussion, along with one prescribed poem from two of the themes in the poetry anthology. These will be published during the first week of April for assessment for the following academic year. Stimuli and poems will be changed every two years.

The suggested duration of the discussion is 5-8 minutes. Centres must make an audio-visual recording of all paired discussions.

Task B will assess AO2 and AO1.

{37}------------------------------------------------

## <span id="page-37-0"></span>4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for GCSE English Language and Literature (Single and Double Award).

Information regarding malpractice is available in our [Guide to preventing, reporting and](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)  [investigating malpractice.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC [\(malpractice@wjec.co.uk](mailto:malpractice@wjec.co.uk) ). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet [Suspected](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)  [Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)

{38}------------------------------------------------

### <span id="page-38-0"></span>5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

#### <span id="page-38-1"></span>5.1 Entries and Awards

This is a unitised qualification. Candidates are entered for each unit separately.

Non-examination assessment opportunities (Unit 2, Unit 3 and Unit 5) will only be available in the summer series each year, while examination assessment opportunities (Unit 1, Unit 4a, Unit 4b and Unit 6) will be available in the summer series and in November each year, until the end of the life of the specification. Please note that November cash-in is only available to post-16 candidates.

Unit 1, Unit 2 and Unit 3 will first be available in summer 2026.

Unit 4b will be available for the first time in November 2026.

Unit 4a, Unit 5 and Unit 6 will be available for the first time in summer 2027.

#### Pre-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or under on 31st August in the academic year in which they were entered)

The terminal rule is set at 30% of the overall qualification for Pre-16 Candidates for GCSE English Language and Literature (Double Award and Single Award) and this must include an examination.

If the assessment being re-taken contributes to the 30% terminal rule requirement, the marks for the new assessment will count regardless of previous results in that assessment.

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade subject to the terminal rule being satisfied first i.e. that candidates must complete 30% of the assessment for a qualification in the series in which they are cashing in.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s). This is referred to as a 'fresh start'. When retaking a qualification (fresh start), a candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from examination units taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating the new grade(s).

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be used for the life of the specification.

Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1st September in the academic year in which they are entered)

There is no terminal rule that applies to Post-16 Candidates for GCSE English Language and Literature.

{39}------------------------------------------------

There is no limit on the number of times candidates can resit an individual unit; however, the better uniform mark score from only the two most recent attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade.

The 'fresh start' rule does not apply to post-16 candidates.

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be used for the life of the specification.

#### **Conversion of a Double Award result to a Single Award result**

Post-16\* candidates can request the conversion of a Double Award result to a Single Award result.

The rules regarding this conversion are:

- A post-16\* candidate must have cashed-in for the Double Award before a request for a conversion can be made for the Single Award.
- Performance in Unit 4b of the Double Award will be used as a proxy for Unit 4a of the Single Award for the purposes of this conversion.
- This route is not permissible for pre-16\* candidates.
- A request can be made by a centre for a conversion for the lifetime of the specification.
- A centre must obtain candidate permission and ensure their eligibility before submitting a request for a conversion.
- Candidates will not be able to do the following:
  - i) use unit 4a for the Double Award cash-in
  - ii) convert from a Single Award result to a Double Award result.
- Candidates cannot receive a result for both the Single Award and Double Award in a single series.

Approved conversions rescind the Double Award result and issues a candidate a new Single Award result.

The procedures for requesting a conversion will be available to centres prior to the first award.

<sup>\*</sup> Candidates who have cashed in in the summer year 11 but aren't 16 when they request back calculation are eligible.
