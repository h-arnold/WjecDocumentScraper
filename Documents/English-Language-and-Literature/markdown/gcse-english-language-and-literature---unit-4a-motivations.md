| 1. | Hermia God speed, fair Helena! Whither away? Helena Call you me fair? That 'fair' again unsay. Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair! Your eyes are lodestars, and your tongue's sweet air More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear. Sickness is catching. O, were favour so, Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go; My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye, My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody. |  |  |  |

Answer question 4 and either question 5 or question 6.

You are advised to spend about 15 minutes on question 4, and about 35 minutes on question 5 or question 6.

**4. Algernon** Oh! I am not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily. You mustn't think that

I am wicked.

**Cecily** If you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all in a very

inexcusable manner. I hope you have not been leading a double life, pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time. That

would be hypocrisy.

**Algernon** *(looks at her in amazement)* Oh! Of course I have been rather

reckless.

**Cecily** I'm glad to hear it.

**Algernon** In fact, now you mention the subject, I have been very bad in my own

small way.

### **Pygmalion – George Bernard Shaw**

Examiner only

Answer question 10 and either question 11 or question 12.

You are advised to spend about 15 minutes on question 10, and about 35 minutes on question 11 or question 12.

**10. HIGGINS** You might marry, you know. *[He bites a large piece out of the apple, and munches it noisily].* You see, Eliza, all men are not confirmed old bachelors like me and the Colonel. Most men are the marrying sort (poor devils!); and you're not bad-looking; it's quite a pleasure to look at you sometimes - not now, of course, because you're crying and looking as ugly as the very devil; but when you're all right and quite yourself, you're what I should call attractive. That is, to the people in the marrying line, you understand. You go to bed and have a good nice rest; and then get up and look at yourself in the glass; and you won't feel so cheap.

| (a) | Explain in your own words what Higgins means by the following:       |     |  |  |

Answer question 13 and either question 14 or question 15.

You are advised to spend about 15 minutes on question 13, and about 35 minutes on question 14 or question 14.

**13. Sheila** I caught sight of this girl smiling at Miss Francis – as if to say: "Doesn't she look awful" – and I was absolutely furious. I was very rude to both of them, and then I went to the manager and told him that this girl had been very impertinent – and – and – *(She almost breaks down, but just controls herself.)* How could I know what would happen afterwards? If she'd been some miserable plain little creature, I don't suppose I'd have done it. But she was very pretty and looked as if she could take care of herself. I couldn't be sorry for her.

# **MARK SCHEME**

#### **Guidance for examiners**

#### **Generic marking principles**

- Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
- Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.
- Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
- Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

#### **Positive marking**

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising candidates for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates' answers. The list is not exhaustive. The inclusion of *'Credit any other valid response.*' (or similar instruction) within mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates' responses. Credit should be given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates' answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However, unless there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks where the answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

#### **Banded mark schemes**

For band marked questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in candidates' answers. It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate's response. As noted above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive and candidates do not have to include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been provided, no marks should be awarded.

{39}------------------------------------------------

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each candidate's response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills, knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors or omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate's answer to pick out the evidence that is being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied. This is done as a two-stage process.

#### **Stage 1 – Deciding on the band**

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate's answer and check whether it matches the descriptors for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the descriptors most closely matches the work.

#### **Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark**

Having determined the appropriate band, deciding on the mark within a band will be made on the basis of a 'best fit' procedure, weaknesses in some areas being compensated for by strengths in others.

Examiners should use the full range of marks available to them. Marking should be positive, rewarding achievement rather that penalising failure or omissions. The awarding of marks must be directly related to the marking criteria, and all responses must be marked according to the banded levels provided for each question.

Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be provided during standardising and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work. Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the standardising material as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the work submitted.

This mark scheme instructs examiners to look for and reward valid alternatives where indicative content is suggested for an answer. This is not a checklist for expected content in an answer, or set out as a 'model answer', as responses must be marked in the banded levels of response provided for each question. Where a candidate provides a response that contains aspects or approaches not included in the indicative content, examiners should use their professional judgement to determine the validity of the response in light of the task and reward as directed by the bands. Candidates are free to choose any approach that is relevant to the set task. Candidates can (and will most likely) incorporate ideas other than those mentioned in the mark scheme.

|  |  | Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore how far you agree with this statement. Support your answer with reference to the play. Comment on the play's contexts. |  |

#### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how linguistic and literary features are used to present Oberon's behaviour throughout the play.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- Puck's introduction to Oberon
- Oberon's past relationship with Hippolyta
- Oberon's clear jealousy of Titania's changeling boy
- Oberon's cruel plan to use Love-in-Idleness to "torment" Titania
- Oberon's kind motives towards Helena and frustration over Puck's mistake
- Oberon's eventual pity for Titania's affection for Bottom
- Oberon's reconciliation with Titania
- the end of the play
- Shakespeare's control of structure
- the use of tension
- the language and tone Shakespeare gives his characters to use.

The most successful responses will consider a range of examples of Oberon's behaviour and the motivations behind these.

Discussion of whether cruelty is the driving force for all of Oberon's behaviour will be assured and evaluative, supported through overview as well as through direct reference, and treated with increasing sensitivity at the top of this band. There will be assured analysis of Shakespeare's use of literary and linguistic techniques. Contexts are likely to be explored with confidence.

Less successful responses will be general and narrative with some focus on Oberon's actions, and events that show him, perhaps, as a cruel figure. Paraphrase or general references may be used. There may be some awareness of how Oberon reflects the wider society of the play, or Elizabethan society, such as men's attitudes towards women.

#### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how linguistic and literary features are used to present attitudes towards love throughout the play.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include considerations of:

- Theseus and Hippolyta's relationship
- Egeus' objections to Lysander
- the relationship between the four lovers in friendship, love and anger
- Oberon and Titania
- Titania and Bottom
- the story of Pyramus and Thisbe
- Shakespeare's control of structure
- the use of conflict and tension
- the language and tone Shakespeare gives his characters to use.

The most successful responses will consider the motivations behind attitudes to love in the play, and how Shakespeare presents these. Discussion of attitudes towards love will be evaluative and astute, with assured use of relevant detail and informed overview. There will be a confident understanding of the way characterisation, events and ideas are portrayed by Shakespeare to convey attitudes, and assured analysis of Shakespeare's use of literary and linguistic techniques. There will be a particular focus on how contextual factors affect characters.

Less successful responses will be mostly narrative, with some discussion of love relationships in the play, such as the royal wedding, the four lovers, Oberon and Titania, Titania and Bottom, and a recognition of attitudes towards these. Paraphrase or general references may be used. There may be some awareness of how these relationships reflect the wider society of the play, or Elizabethan society.

#### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how linguistic and literary features are used to present female behaviour and Victorian society as its driving-force throughout the play.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- Lady Bracknell's relationship with Algernon
- Lady Bracknell's treatment of Gwendolen and expectations for her marriage
- Lady Bracknell's treatment of Jack
- Gwendolen's behaviour with Jack
- Cecily's behaviour with Algernon
- Algernon and Jack's discussions about the female characters
- Miss Prism's behaviour towards Dr Chasuble
- Cecily and Gwendolen's interactions, both as adversaries and then as friends
- the end of the play
- the way Wilde uses structure to make events more interesting
- the use of conflict and tension
- the language and tone Wilde gives his characters to use.

The most successful responses will consider how the behaviour of female characters is motivated by Victorian social expectations. Discussion of how the behaviour of female characters is motivated by Victorian social expectations will be assured and evaluative, with direct reference and overview. There will be an increased sensitivity in discussion. Gwendolen and Cecily may well still be the main characters considered, but the impact of social rules on other female characters, such as Lady Bracknell and Miss Prism, should also be valued when considered relevantly. There will be assured analysis of Wilde's use of literary and linguistic techniques.

Less successful responses will be fairly simple narrative with an awareness of the behaviour of some of the female characters, perhaps linked to some discussion of Victorian society. Paraphrase or general references may be used.

#### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how linguistic and literary features are used to present the ways in which characters deceive each other.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- Algernon and Jack's claim to the name of Ernest and their deceptions at the Manor House
- Algernon and Jack's claim to the name of Ernest and their deceptions at the Manor House
- Algernon's use of Bunbury to excuse himself from invitations
- Jack's lies to Cecily
- Gwendolen's hints of doing "something desperate" to marry Jack as a covert response to Lady Bracknell's disapproval
- Algernon's lies to Cecily
- Cecily's made-up letters from Algernon
- Gwendolen and Cecily's fractious first meeting
- Miss Prism's secret past
- the way Wilde uses structure to make events more interesting
- the use of conflict and tension
- the language and tone Wilde gives his characters to use.

The most successful responses will consider the motivations behind the deceptive behaviour of characters in the play, with reference to how class expectations affect these behaviours. Discussion of deceptive characters and actions and what motivates these will be evaluative and astute, with assured use of relevant detail and informed overview. There will be a confident understanding of the way characterisation, events and ideas about deception are portrayed by Wilde, and assured analysis of the playwright's use of literary and linguistic techniques. There will be a particular focus on how contextual factors and class expectations affect characters' deceptive behaviours.

Less successful responses will be mostly narrative, with some discussion of one or two characters and events that show deception. Paraphrase or general references may be used. There will be awareness of the play's context, and, perhaps, empathy, towards the top of this mark range.

| 8. | Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore how the characters are changed by the threats they face. Support your answer with reference to the play. Comment on the play's contexts. | [25] |

#### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how linguistic and literary features are used to present how characters are changed by the threats they face.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- Alem's reaction to Mr Hardwick in scene 2
- the threats posed and experienced by the boys from the children's home
- the flashback scenes in Ethiopia and Eritrea and the effect of threat on Alem's family
- the Fitzgeralds' reactions to events and Alem's experiences in the foster family
- the court scene and the effect of the threat of deportation
- the protest scenes
- Alem's parents
- the way Zephaniah and Sissay use structure to make events more interesting
- the use of conflict and tension
- the language and tone the writers give the characters to use.

The most successful answers will consider the effect of threats on characters' decisions and behaviours, with careful discussion of what changes these bring about. Answers will be well referenced, discussing the way characters are changed by the threats they face. There will be some sensitivity, and, towards the top of this mark range, evidence of evaluation. There will be assured analysis of the ways the writers use literary and linguistic techniques. There will be a focus on how contextual factors, such as social situation, conflict, and the justice system might affect the ways characters change. Candidates might also consider aspects relevant to the writers' backgrounds.

Less successful responses will be reliant on narrative with some relevant discussion of events in the play that show how characters change. There will be awareness of the play's context, and, perhaps, empathy, towards the top of this mark range. Paraphrase or general references may be used.

| 9. | Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore how Zephaniah presents friendship throughout the play Refugee Boy. Support your answer with reference to the play. Comment on the play's contexts. | [25] |

#### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how linguistic and literary features are used to present attitudes towards friendship throughout the play.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- Alem's confusion when misunderstanding the other boys' speech and motives
- the boys' behaviour towards each other and their changing treatment of Alem
- Ruth's concerns for Alem
- the court scenes and the writers' choice to have court roles played by the Fitzgeralds
- evidence of friendship in the protest scenes
- the end of the play
- the way Zephaniah and Sissay use structure to make events more interesting
- the use of conflict and tension
- the language and tone the writers give the characters to use.

The most successful responses will consider the motivations behind forming and keeping friendships in the play. Discussion of attitudes towards friendship will be evaluative and astute, with assured use of relevant detail and informed overview. There will be a confident understanding of the way characterisation, events and ideas are portrayed by the writers to convey attitudes, and assured analysis of how the writers use literary and linguistic techniques. There will be a particular focus on how contextual factors affect characters. Candidates might also consider aspects relevant to the writers' backgrounds.

Less successful responses will be mostly narrative, with some discussion of friendship, or lack of friendship in the play, such as for Alem, the boys in the children's home, and Ruth. Paraphrase or general references may be used. There may be some awareness of how these relationships reflect the wider society of the play and the writers' own experiences.

| 11. | Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore what Higgins' treatment of Eliza in Pygmalion shows us about life in Britain in the early twentieth century. | [25] |

#### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how linguistic and literary features are used to present Higgins' treatment of Eliza.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include:

- how Higgins upsets Eliza on their first meeting
- the way he speaks and behaves towards her at his flat
- when he's teaching her
- the way he views her as a project
- their confrontation after the embassy party
- the fact that he struggles to manage without her at the play's end
- the way Shaw uses structure to make events more interesting
- the use of conflict and tension
- the language and tone Shaw gives his characters to use.

The most successful responses will consider how far Higgins' treatment of Eliza is informed by the time in which he lives. Discussion of what Higgins' treatment of Eliza shows us about life in Britain in the early twentieth century will be assured and evaluative, with overview as well as through direct reference, and with increasing sensitivity. There will be assured analysis of Shaw's use of literary and linguistic techniques. Contexts are likely to be explored with confidence. There may be a recognition that Higgins embodies many aspects of society at the time, but is also socially inept himself.

Less successful responses will be general and narrative with some focus on Higgins' treatment of Eliza. Paraphrase or general references may be used. There may be some awareness of how Higgins' attitudes reflect the wider society of the play.

| 12. | "People are clever in different ways in Pygmalion." Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore how far you agree with this statement. Remember to support your answer with reference to the play. You should comment on the play's contexts. | [25] |

#### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how linguistic and literary features are used to present characters different areas of knowledge.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- Eliza's areas of knowledge and also misinterpretations of events
- Higgins and Pickering's knowledge of language
- Higgins' lack of social awareness or empathy
- Mrs Pearce's influence on both Eliza and Higgins
- Eliza's learning experience
- Mrs Eynsford Hill and Clara learning about the 'new ways'
- Mrs Higgins' understanding of her son and awareness of events
- Mr Doolittle's bargaining with Higgins
- the way Shaw uses structure to make events more interesting
- the use of conflict and tension
- the language and tone Shaw gives his characters to use.

The most successful responses will consider how characters' cleverness is affected by class expectations of the time. Answers will be well referenced, discussing the characters' different areas of knowledge with some sensitivity, and, towards the top of this mark range, with evidence of evaluation. There will be assured analysis of Shaw's use of literary and linguistic techniques. There will be a focus on how contextual factors, such as class and education levels, might affect characters' areas of knowledge.

Less successful responses will be reliant on narrative with some relevant discussion of events in the play that show in what way characters are clever. There will be awareness of the play's context, and, perhaps, empathy, towards the top of this mark range. Paraphrase or general references may be used.

| 14. | the play. | Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore which character you think changes the most as a result of the Inspector's visit. Support your answer with reference to Comment on the play's contexts. | [25] |

#### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how linguistic and literary features are used to present the character's change.

Candidates may choose any appropriate character, although arguments for characters who do not change much will probably be less convincing. Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- the extent to which Birling learns about himself and others
- Sheila's change, and what she learns about herself, other people and wider society
- the extent to which Gerald learns about himself and other people
- the extent to which Mrs Birling learns about herself and other people
- Eric's change, and what he learns about himself, other people and wider society
- the way Priestley uses structure and Act breaks to make events more interesting
- the use of conflict and tension
- the language and tone Priestley gives his characters to use.

The most successful responses will consider how the chosen character's ability to change is affected by the time in which they live and what this shows about the character. Answers will be well referenced, discussing the character's change with some sensitivity, and, towards the top of this mark range, with evidence of evaluation. There will be assured analysis of Priestley's use of literary and linguistic techniques. There will be a focus on how contextual factors, such as class, might affect the character's learning journey and change.

Less successful responses will be reliant on narrative, with some relevant discussion of a character who changes as a result of the Inspector's visit. There will be awareness of the play's context, and, perhaps, empathy, towards the top of this mark range. Paraphrase or general references may be used.

| 15. | play. | Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore how Priestley presents the upper class in Britain at the time the play is set. Support your answer with reference to the Comment on the play's contexts. | [25] |

#### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how literary and linguistic features are used to present the upper class in the play.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- Birling's power in the household and in work, and his attempts to intimidate the Inspector
- Sheila's abuse of her privileged position / her growing confidence and empowerment
- Gerald's treatment of Eva and his attitude towards women
- Mrs Birling's behaviour, her attempts to avoid interrogation and her treatment of Eva
- Eric's treatment of Eva and his changing role in the household
- the Inspector's attitudes to upper-class characters
- a wider consideration of the upper class in Edwardian society, perhaps through characters
- such as Joe Meggarty and Charlie Brunswick
- the way Priestley uses structure and Act breaks to make events more interesting
- the use of conflict and tension
- the language and tone Priestley gives his characters to use.

The most successful responses will consider how Priestley presents the behaviour of upper-class characters as motivated by Edwardian social expectations. Discussion of upper-class characters and their attitudes will be evaluative and astute, with assured use of relevant detail and informed overview. There will be a confident understanding of the way characterisation, events and ideas are portrayed by Priestley to convey these attitudes, and assured analysis of Priestley's use of literary and linguistic techniques. There will be a particular focus on how contextual factors affect characters.

Less successful responses will be dependent on simple narrative with an awareness of upper-class characters and the events they are involved in. There may be empathy evident. Paraphrase or general references may be used. Reference to context will probably be implicit at this level.
