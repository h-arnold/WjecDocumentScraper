You are advised to spend about 15 minutes on question **10**, and about 35 minutes on question **11** or question **12**.

**10.** He turns the corner and sees a car lying on its side. Fat arms of white fire curl out of the broken windows and wave at him. Something in the car is hissing like fat in a frying pan. Leon turns and runs back the other way. The next road is deserted. The street lights are broken but the lights are on in every house and a woman stands on the corner covering her face and crying. Two men in turbans shout at him.

"Get off the street! Can't you see? Go home!"

"No! Come with us. Over here."

Leon takes a few steps towards them. "I'm lost," he says.

**13.** Pigeon stares. In the fair, the dark gathering away from it all, the fairlights whirling, the van resting on its side at the bottom of the hill, and Cher lying there, her soft skin white, dotted like a tabbycat's coat, but with red. Pigeon looks at Cher, and thinks it's strange how it's all happened, thinks how Cher believed it all, every word, and he didn't, not deep down. Didn't deep down believe his own stories about Gwyn.

Pigeon looks at Gwyn there, his angular body shaking over Cher's fragile one as he tries to get her to wake up.

"Tyrd!" Gwyn says, over and over, come on…

Answer question **16** and **either** question **17** or question **18**.

You are advised to spend about 15 minutes on question **16**, and about 35 minutes on question **17** or question **18**.

**16.** The men gave a shout of triumph. They saw, as they imagined, their enemies in flight, and they rushed after them in disorder. This was just what Snowball had intended. As soon as they were well inside the yard, the three horses, the three cows, and the rest of the pigs, who had been lying in ambush in the cowshed, suddenly emerged in their rear, cutting them off. Snowball now gave the signal for the charge. He himself dashed straight for Jones. Jones saw him coming, raised the gun, and fired.

## **MARK SCHEME**

## **Guidance for examiners**

## **Generic marking principles**

- Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
- Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.
- Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
- Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

### **Positive marking**

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising candidates for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates' answers. The list is not exhaustive. The inclusion of *'Credit any other valid response.*' (or similar instruction) within mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates' responses. Credit should be given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates' answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However, unless there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks where the answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

### **Banded mark schemes**

For band marked questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in candidates' answers. It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate's response. As noted above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive and candidates do not have to include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been provided, no marks should be awarded.

{45}------------------------------------------------

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each candidate's response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills, knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors or omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate's answer to pick out the evidence that is being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied. This is done as a two-stage process.

### **Stage 1 – Deciding on the band**

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate's answer and check whether it matches the descriptors for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the descriptors most closely matches the work.

### **Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark**

Having determined the appropriate band, deciding on the mark within a band will be made on the basis of a 'best fit' procedure, weaknesses in some areas being compensated for by strengths in others.

Examiners should use the full range of marks available to them. Marking should be positive, rewarding achievement rather that penalising failure or omissions. The awarding of marks must be directly related to the marking criteria, and all responses must be marked according to the banded levels provided for each question.

Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be provided during standardising and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work. Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the standardising material as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the work submitted.

This mark scheme instructs examiners to look for and reward valid alternatives where indicative content is suggested for an answer. This is not a checklist for expected content in an answer, or set out as a 'model answer', as responses must be marked in the banded levels of response provided for each question. Where a candidate provides a response that contains aspects or approaches not included in the indicative content, examiners should use their professional judgement to determine the validity of the response in light of the task and reward as directed by the bands. Candidates are free to choose any approach that is relevant to the set task. Candidates can (and will most likely) incorporate ideas other than those mentioned in the mark scheme.

**2.** Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore how Winsome Pinnock presents the changing relationship between Enid and Del throughout the play. Remember to support your answer with reference to the play. Comment on the play's contexts. [25]

### **Indicative Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how literary and linguistic features are used to present the changing relationship between Enid and Del.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- Enid and Del's early disagreement in Mai's flat
- Enid's reaction to Del losing her job and Del's retaliation
- Del's secret pregnancy and escape to Mai's flat
- The conversations Del has with Mai about Enid
- Enid sharing her worries about Del with Mai
- Del embracing the life of an obeah and her final reconciliation with Enid
- Pinnock's control of structure
- the use of tension
- the language and tone Pinnock gives her characters to use.

The most successful responses will consider the shifting dynamics of the relationship and what this reveals about both Enid and Del. Answers will be evaluative and assured, showing a clear appreciation of the changing relationship between Enid and Del. There may be a sensitive analysis of the stages of the relationship, through their confrontations, separate conversations with Mai, and final, awkward reconciliation. There will be assured analysis of Pinnock's use of literary and linguistic techniques, such as the characters' language divisions. Contexts are likely to be explored with confidence, with understanding shown of how Enid's pride in Britain is at odds with Del's experiences.

Less successful responses will be predominantly narrative with reference to the main features of Enid and Del's relationship, such as their arguments and Del running away to live with Mai. Paraphrase or general references may be used. There may be some awareness of how Enid and Del's feelings about British society differ.

**3.** "The struggle to fit into 1980's British society is what drives most of the characters in the play." Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore how far you agree with this statement. Remember to support your answer with reference to the play. [25]

### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how literary and linguistic features are used to present the ways in which characters struggle to fit in.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- the significance of Enid's visits to Mai
- Enid's continued ties to Jamaica
- Enid's pride of her life in Britain set against her experiences in work
- Enid's conversations with Broderick
- Del's treatment in work
- Viv's rejection of the education system
- the conflict between Enid and her daughters
- how far Mai wishes to fit into British society
- Pinnock's control of structure
- the use of tension
- the language and tone Pinnock gives her characters to use.

The most successful responses will consider how far the behaviour of the characters is motivated by their different life experiences and different attitudes towards the importance of fitting in. Discussion of how the struggle to fit in drives the characters will be evaluative and astute, with assured use of relevant detail and informed overview. There will be a confident understanding of the way characterisation, events and ideas about the struggle to fit in are portrayed by Pinnock, and assured analysis of the playwright's use of literary and linguistic techniques. There may be a consideration of whether Mai wishes to fit into British society, and the different struggles experienced by first generation and second generation immigrant characters. There will be a particular focus on how contextual factors and social expectations affect characters' behaviours, with, perhaps, a consideration of Pinnock's own experiences.

Less successful responses will be dependent on simple, general narrative, with some awareness of events and characters who feel they do or do not fit into society. There may be some generality rather than focus on specific events, with some awareness shown of how the characters' struggles reflect their backgrounds and British society at the time.

**5.** Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore to what extent Phil controls one or two of the other characters in the play. Remember to support your answer with reference to the play. You should comment on the play's contexts. [25]

### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how linguistic and literary features are used to present Phil's control over one or two other characters.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- the effect of Phil's silences
- his planning of the cover-up and framing
- the decisions he makes for the group
- his threats towards Brian and Danny
- his decision to murder Adam
- John, Richard and Cathy's levels of control
- Phil's final withdrawal from the group
- the cultural influence of teenage gang stereotypes
- social pressures faced by young people
- Kelly's control of structure
- the use of tension
- the language and tone Kelly gives his characters to use.

The most successful responses will consider Phil's motivations for controlling characters, and the characters' reasons for submitting to or trying to rebel against this control. Discussion of the extent to which Phil controls characters will be assured and evaluative, supported through overview as well as through direct reference, and treated with increasing sensitivity at the top of this band. There will be assured analysis of Kelly's use of literary and linguistic techniques. Contexts are likely to be explored with confidence.

Less successful responses will be general and narrative with some focus on Phil's actions, and events that show his control over one or two characters. Paraphrase or general references may be used. There may be some awareness of how Phil represents the cultural view of the teenage gang leader.

**6.** "The need to belong is what drives the characters' behaviour in the play." Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore how far you agree with this statement. Remember to support your answer with reference to the play. You should comment on the play's contexts. [25]

### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how literary and linguistic features are used to present the behaviour of characters.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- the group's early confusion
- Leah's attempts to forge a bond with Phil
- John's attempts at group unity and later mental decline
- Phil's planning, framing and group control
- the effect of Cathy's DNA 'initiative' on the group
- how Adam's return, and eventual murder affect the group dynamic
- the cultural influence of teenage gang stereotypes
- social pressures faced by young people
- Kelly's control of structure
- the use of tension
- the language and tone Kelly gives his characters to use.

The most successful responses will consider how far the behaviour of the characters is motivated by their situation and their different attitudes towards the importance of belonging to the group. Discussion of how the behaviour of characters could be motivated by the need to belong will be assured and evaluative, with direct reference and overview. There will be an increased sensitivity in discussion. Analysis of Kelly's use of literary and linguistic techniques will be assured. Wider contexts, such as social and cultural attitudes to teenage gangs, social responses to cases of child crime and the playwright's views of curtailing Western liberties in the wake of terrorist attacks may be considered.

Less successful responses will be fairly simple in narrative with an awareness of how characters' behaviour in the play could be driven by the need to belong. Paraphrase or general references may be used. There may be some awareness of social and cultural attitudes towards teenage gangs.

Answer

**8.** Using linguistic and literary approaches, show how Priestley uses **one** of the characters in *An Inspector Calls* to convey his opinions and attitudes about life in early twentieth century Britain. [25]

### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how Priestley uses literary and linguistic features to present characters and convey his own opinions and attitudes about life in early twentieth century Britain.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- the role of the Inspector and how his attitudes represent Priestley's own
- the unfavourable presentation of the Birlings and Gerald and the opinions and attitudes Priestley conveys about people like this
- the more favourable or softening of the presentation of some characters, such as Sheila and Eric, and the opinions and attitudes Priestley conveys through them
- the sympathetic presentation of Eva Smith and what this shows about Priestley's opinions and attitudes towards the working class
- the relevance of the play's reference to historical events
- Priestley's control of structure
- the use of tension
- the language and tone Priestley gives his characters to use.

The most successful answers will consider how Priestley's favourable or unfavourable presentation of characters reflects his own views of members of society at this time. Discussion of how the behaviour and attitudes of the candidate's chosen character are influenced by Edwardian values will be assured and evaluative, with direct reference and overview. There will be an increased sensitivity in discussion of how Priestley presents this character through literary and linguistic features in order to convey his own opinions and attitudes. There will be an assured analysis of how Priestley's favourable or unfavourable presentation of characters reflects his own views of members of society at this time.

Less successful responses will be fairly simple in narrative with an awareness of the behaviour of the candidate's chosen character, perhaps linked to some discussion of life in early twentieth century Britain and Priestley's opinions and attitudes towards it. Paraphrase or general references may be used.

Answer

**9.** Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore how Priestley presents attitudes to money in *An Inspector Calls*. Remember to support your answer with reference to the play. You should comment on the play's contexts. [25]

### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how literary and linguistic features are used to present attitudes to money throughout the play.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- the Birlings' home
- Birling's position in society and his eagerness for Sheila to marry Gerald
- how Birling's statements about society and business reflect his interests
- Birling's treatment of Eva Smith
- the way Sheila uses her privilege
- Gerald's privileged life, his behaviour at the Palace Bar and the County Hotel, his use of Charlie Brunswick's flat and his treatment of Eva Smith
- the way Mrs Birling uses her privilege
- Eric's treatment of Eva
- Eva's attitude to money
- the Inspector's attitudes about those in privileged positions
- the end of the play
- Priestley's control of structure
- the use of tension
- the language and tone Priestley gives his characters to use.

The most successful responses will consider the motivations behind attitudes to money in the play, and how Priestley presents these. Discussion of attitudes to money will be evaluative and astute, with assured use of relevant detail and informed overview. There will be a confident understanding of the way characterisation, events and ideas are portrayed by Priestley to convey attitudes, and assured analysis of Priestley's use of literary and linguistic techniques. There will be a particular focus on how contextual factors affect characters.

Less successful responses will be mostly narrative, with some discussion of attitudes to money in the play, such as through the Birlings and Gerald, Eva and the Inspector. Paraphrase or general references may be used. There may be some awareness of how attitudes to money reflect twentieth century society.

**11.** "Hope is the driving-force for Leon's behaviour in the novel." Using literary and linguistic approaches, explore how far you agree with this statement. Remember to support your answer with reference to the novel. You should comment on the novel's contexts. [25]

### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how literary and linguistic techniques are used to present hope as the possible driving force for Leon's behaviour.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- Leon's hopes for his relationship with his mother
- Leon's care of Jake and desire to stay with him
- Maureen's influence on Jake
- how life with Sylvia affects Jake's hopes
- how Leon's friendships at the allotment affect him
- Leon's experiences with Zebra
- the effect of the race riots on Leon
- Leon's adoption.

The most successful responses will discuss whether hope is the driving force for Leon's behaviour, these will be assured and evaluative, supported through overview as well as through direct reference, and treated with increasing sensitivity at the top of this band. There will be assured analysis of the ways de Waal uses literary and linguistic techniques. There will be a focus on how contextual factors, such as the care system and the race riots of the 1980s, affect Leon.

Less successful responses will be reliant on narrative with some relevant discussion of events in the play that show Leon's behaviour and, perhaps, how this is driven by his hopes. There will be awareness of the novel's context, and, perhaps, empathy, towards the top of this mark range. Paraphrase or general references may be used.

Answer

**12.** Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore how Kit de Waal presents attitudes to family throughout the novel. Remember to support your answer with reference to the novel. You should comment on the novel's contexts. [25]

### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how literary and linguistic features are used to present ideas about family.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- Leon's confusing relationship with his mother
- the responsibility Leon feels for Jake
- Leon's relationship with Maureen
- when Leon goes to live with Sylvia
- the influence of Leon's wider social group, such as Tufty and Mr Devlin
- the effect of the social care system on Leon
- the end of the novel
- de Waal's own life experiences
- de Waal's control of structure
- use of tension
- characterization
- narrative voice.

The most successful responses will consider different ideas about family and how these ideas affect characters' behaviour in the novel. Discussion of ideas about family will be evaluative and astute, with assured use of relevant detail and informed overview. There will be a confident understanding of the way characterisation, events and ideas are portrayed by the writer to convey different ideas and attitudes, and assured analysis of how de Waal uses literary and linguistic techniques. There will be a particular focus on how contextual factors affect characters. Candidates might also consider aspects relevant to de Waal's background.

Less successful responses will be mostly narrative, with some discussion of different family situations in the novel, such as Leon and his mother and brother, with Maureen and with Sylvia. Paraphrase or general references may be used. There may be some awareness of how these relationships reflect the wider society of the novel and the writer's own experiences.

**Answer**

**14.** Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore how Alys Conran presents the changing relationship between Pigeon and Iola throughout the novel. Remember to support your answer with reference to the novel. You should comment on the novel's contexts. [25]

### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how literary and linguistic features are used to present the changing relationship between Pigeon and Iola.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- shifting ideas about Gwyn and how this affects Pigeon and Iola's relationship
- the differences between Pigeon and Iola's home lives
- the effect on the friendship of Pigeon and Iola's sibling relationships
- reactions to Cher's accident
- the shifting blame for the shooting of Pigeon's stepfather
- the effect on the relationship of Pigeon's time in prison
- the relationship at the end of the novel
- contextual factors, such as the effect of multiculturalism, poverty and fractured families
- Conran's control of structure
- use of tension
- characterisation
- narrative voice.

The most successful responses will consider the shifting dynamics of the relationship and what this reveals about both Pigeon and Iola. Answers will be evaluative and assured, showing a clear appreciation of the changing relationship between Pigeon and Iola. There may be a sensitive analysis of the stages of the relationship, through their shared view of Gwyn, the shifts in this, their confrontations, and their final reconciliation. There will be assured analysis of Conran's use of literary and linguistic techniques, such as the shifting narrative perspective and what the use of Welsh reveals about the stages of the relationship. Contexts are likely to be explored with confidence.

Less successful responses will be predominantly narrative with reference to the main features of Pigeon and Iola's relationship, such as their shared ideas about Gwyn and the shooting of Pigeon's stepfather. Paraphrase or general references may be used. There may be some contextual awareness of how Pigeon and Iola differ in background and social situation.

Answer

**15.** "Pigeon is a book about looking for the truth." Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore how far you agree with this statement. Remember to support your answer with reference to the novel. You should comment on the novel's contexts. [25]

### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how literary and linguistic features are used to present the characters' search for the truth.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- Pigeon's hatred of his stepfather being focused on Gwyn
- the stories about Gwyn and the trouble these cause
- Pigeon's level of understanding about his mother
- the reader's own search for the truth about the shooting
- Iola's growing awareness of Pigeon's problems, of Efa's life, and of Cher's
- Iola's search for the truth about Nain, Taid, and her father
- Dafydd, Efa and Iola
- the police looking for the truth
- Gwyn's search for a sense of identity
- Conran's control of structure
- use of tension
- characterisation
- narrative voice.

The most successful answers will consider how far the characters' decisions and behaviour are motivated by their desire to look for the truth. Discussion of how the behaviour of characters is driven by their search for the truth will be assured and evaluative, with direct reference and overview. There will be an increased sensitivity in discussion. Analysis of Conran's use of literary and linguistic techniques will be assured with an analysis of, perhaps, the effect of the shifting narrative perspective and the use of Welsh. Contexts are likely to be explored with confidence.

Less successful responses will be fairly simple narrative with an awareness of how character behaviour in the play is driven by their search for the truth. Paraphrase or general references may be used. There may be some contextual awareness of characters' social situations.

| (c) | Read the whole extract. What impressions of the animals does the writer create in this extract?<br>Give 0 marks for responses where there is nothing worthy of credit.<br>Give 1 mark to those who identify and comment on superficial details. These answers may struggle to engage with the text and/or question.<br>Give 2 marks to those who identify details and give straightforward comments supported by some textual references. These answers may rely on paraphrasing or narrative approaches.<br>Give 3 marks to those who make clear comments about different impressions supported by textual references. These answers show awareness of the writer's use of language and make inferences.<br>Give 4 marks to those who make accurate and perceptive comments about different impressions supported by purposeful textual references. These answers make clear inferences based on how the writer has constructed meaning and include an understanding of the writer's craft.<br>Ideas candidates may explore may include:<br>Snowball has anticipated the men's behaviour "just what Snowball had intended"the animals "suddenly emerged" taking the men by surprisethe animals "lying in ambush" denotes the meticulous planning they have donethe animals work together to implement Snowball's plan"gave the signal for the charge"Snowball has been in control of the situation so far so Jones's actions are unexpectedthe animals – particularly Snowball – are brave "He himself dashed straight for Jones"the animals seem unlikely to win against a man with a gun but are willing to sacrifice themselves.Reward valid alternatives. | [4] | [4] |

**17.** "There are no truly innocent characters in *Animal Farm*."

Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore how far you agree with this statement. Remember to support your answer with reference to the novel. You should comment on the novel's contexts. [25]

### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how literary and linguistic features are used to present innocent and/or corrupt characters:

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- the motivations of Jones, Pilkington and Frederick
- Napoleon, Squealer and the pigs' motivations and their methods of manipulation
- Snowball's naivety
- Old Major's role in the novel
- Clover's self-doubt
- Moses' behaviour
- Mollie's self-absorption
- Benjamin's cynicism
- the ways in which the characters' behaviour can be regarded as either innocent or corrupt and the effect this has on events in novel
- links to relevant context / the Russian Revolution / Orwell's political beliefs
- Orwell's control of structure
- use of tension
- characterisation and use of anthropomorphism
- narrative voice.

The most successful answers will consider the motivations behind characters' decisions and behaviours and how far characters can therefore be considered as innocent or corrupt. Discussion of innocent and/or culpable characters and what motivates their behaviour will be evaluative and astute, with assured use of relevant detail and informed overview. There will be a confident understanding of the way characterisation, events and ideas about innocence, naivety and/or corruption are portrayed by Orwell, and assured analysis of the writer's use of literary and linguistic techniques. There will be a particular focus on how contextual factors affect characters. Candidates might also consider aspects relevant to the writer's background.

Less successful answers will be mostly narrative, with some discussion of characters and behaviour that can be seen as innocent or as causing problems. Paraphrase or general references may be used. There will be awareness of the novel's context, and, perhaps, empathy, towards the top of this mark range.

**18.** Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore how Orwell uses *Animal Farm* as a warning against dangerous human behaviour. Remember to support your answer with reference to the novel. You should comment on the novel's contexts. [25]

### **Content**

Look for relevant textual support with some reference to how Orwell uses literary and linguistic features to use the novel as a warning against dangerous human behaviour.

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include a consideration of:

- the behaviour and motivations of Jones, Pilkington and Frederick
- Napoleon, Squealer and the pigs' actions and links to wider context and human behaviour
- Snowball's naivety and mistakes
- Old Major's role in the novel
- Clover's self-doubt and inaction
- Moses and links to the role of religion in the novel
- Mollie's self-absorption and wider links to the petit bourgeoisie
- Benjamin's cynicism and lack of direct action
- the ways in which the characters' behaviour represents human error
- links to relevant context / the Russian Revolution / Orwell's political beliefs
- Orwell's control of structure
- use of tension
- characterisation and use of anthropomorphism
- narrative voice.

The most successful answers will consider the message Orwell conveys through the novel and how this is conveyed through the decisions and behaviours the writer gives his characters. Discussion of how Orwell uses the novel as a warning against dangerous human behaviour will be assured and evaluative, with direct reference and overview. There will be an increased sensitivity in discussion and a clear understanding of how characters reflect wider society. There will be assured analysis of Orwell's use of literary and linguistic techniques.

Less successful responses will be fairly simple narrative with an awareness of how Orwell uses the novel as a warning against dangerous human behaviour, perhaps linked to some discussion of relevant context. Paraphrase or general references may be used.
