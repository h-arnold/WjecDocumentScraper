# Task A

### Overview

This is an essay task.

The suggested length is **750-1000** words.

The total time learners are allowed to spend on the research and planning stage is **3 hours**.

The total time learners are allowed to spend on the task-taking stage is **2 hours**.

Marks available: **30**

### The task

The essay task will be prescribed by WJEC. Centres may tailor the title of task to suit their chosen text ensuring accessibility and relevance for their learners while maintaining the required level of analytical depth and rigour.

The task will be released in April the year before assessment. The same task will remain for two series. Centres are required to ensure they use the correct task for each series. Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the year learners undertake the task.

The essay will be linked to learners' understanding of **Belonging** developed through the study of a prose text from the longlist. Learners will use a range of linguistic and literary approaches to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the whole text, exploring the theme of **Belonging** through the study of character(s) and/or setting.

Areas based on the theme of **Belonging** that could be considered include, but are not limited to:

- (a) familial belonging
- (b) cultural belonging
- (c) social belonging
- (d) locational belonging
- (e) self-belonging
- (f) anything counter to belonging such as: exclusion, isolation, alienation, disconnection.

### Learners should:

- give a sustained response, reflecting an understanding of the text as a whole
- use linguistic and literary approaches, including an analysis of the language, structure and form choices made by the writer and the effect of these on the reader
- use context to inform analysis of the prose text
- have a clear and developing argument that addresses the question directly and a conclusion summing up the content of the response and drawing the analysis/evaluation together.

{6}------------------------------------------------

### 1. Area: Self-belonging

Task title: Examine the ways one or two characters present the theme of self-belonging in your studied novel. 

### Sample tailored titles

- (a) Examine the ways Marcus's situation presents the theme of self-belonging in *About a Boy*.
- (b) Examine the ways changes in Scrooge's character reflect the theme of selfbelonging in *A Christmas Carol*.

Or

### 2. Area: Isolation

Task title: Examine the ways one or two characters present the theme of isolation in your studied novel. 

### Sample tailored titles

© WJEC CBAC Ltd 2025.

- (a) Examine the ways Jean Rhys develops Antoinette's journey to present the theme of isolation in *Wide Sargasso Sea*.
- (b) Examine the ways Golding presents the boys' developing isolation in *Lord of the Flies*.

In tailoring the generic task, there is no expectation that all learners in a centre will use the same text or the same title in completing this unit.

### Preparing for the Assessment – Research and planning stage

It is important that centres have already read, studied and prepared the texts with learners before they start this process.

Learners are allowed **3 hours** for the research and planning stage of this task. This does not include time taken reading, studying and preparing texts with the learners.

Learners are not permitted to complete any of the research and planning work related to the NEA outside of the centre.

{7}------------------------------------------------

### Resources

During the research and planning stage of this task:

- learners may have access to a copy of the studied text
- learners may have access to dictionaries and thesauri
- learners can have access to resources and/or preparatory notes. They should, however, be advised that all work must be their own – copying and pasting from internet sources, using comments from critics without acknowledgement and/or reproducing someone else's essay is plagiarism
- the use of AI to generate responses is prohibited and will be treated as malpractice
- learners' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be stored securely between timetabled sessions.

If learners are provided with worksheets/scaffolding for the preparation of the assessment, copies of the assistance they have been given must be included with the moderation sample. Such worksheets are not permitted as part of the notes for task-taking. Comments as to the nature and amount of help given should be made on the Unit 2 non-examination assessment Candidate Mark Record sheet.

### Supervision

For the research and planning stage of this task, learners must be indirectly supervised.

Centres must ensure that:

- all candidates participate in the assessment
- there is sufficient supervision to ensure that work can be authenticated
- the work an individual candidate submits for assessment is their own.

{8}------------------------------------------------

### Task Taking – Essay Writing

Following the completion of the preparation stage, the final task must be completed under direct supervision.

Learners are allowed a total of **2 hours** to complete this task. This time allowance may be split up into shorter periods to suit the centre and may include any redrafting if required.

If the assessment session is broken up into shorter periods of time, all learners' work must be collected and kept securely within the centre.

### Resources

During the task taking stage of this task:

- learners are not permitted to use notes in the assessment session. They may have a copy of the text, but this must be checked for notes/essay plans to prevent any incidents of malpractice. This also prohibits the use of extracts from the play rather than a whole copy
- work may be handwritten or digitally produced. No access to dictionaries or thesauri is permitted during task-taking, and digital grammar and spell check programmes must be disabled
- once the work is completed by the learner in this two-hour period, it may not be revised.

### Supervision

For the task taking stage, learners must be directly supervised.

The centre must ensure that:

- all candidates are within direct sight of the supervisor throughout the session(s)
- display materials which might provide assistance are removed or covered
- there is no access to e-mail, the internet or mobile phones
- candidates complete their work independently
- interaction with other candidates does not occur
- no assistance of any description is provided.

{9}------------------------------------------------

# Task B

### Overview

This is an individually researched oral presentation.

The task is set by centres but must meet the parameters laid down by WJEC.

Centres must make an audio-visual recording of all presentations.

Learners will develop oracy skills and conduct research towards the presentation.

Tasks set must direct learners to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of theme, issue, representation or relationship linked to the learner's understanding of **Belonging** developed through their literary study for Task A.

The total time learners are allowed to spend on the research and planning stage is **2 hours**.

The total time learners are allowed to spend on the task-taking stage is **4-6 minutes**.

Marks available: **30**

{10}------------------------------------------------

### Development of the task

The task must focus on a theme, issue, representation or relationship linked to **Belonging** and inspired by the studied prose text.

Different tasks may be developed by the teacher to meet the needs of individual learners, or for a whole class or cohort if appropriate. WJEC examples of tasks may be used or modified by centres if appropriate to meet the needs of their learners.

![](_page_9_Figure_3.jpeg)

### Unit 2 Task B must:

- have a clearly defined focus to give learners the opportunity to show their understanding of an aspect linked to **Belonging**
- give opportunities for research to support the presentation with statistics, facts, evidence as well as examples from texts
- allow learners to present and develop ideas on their selected topic.

### Possible aspects for investigation

- Relationships family dynamics, friendship groups, belonging at different life stages
- Diversity multicultural belonging, celebrations and traditions from different cultures, bilingualism/language barriers
- Wales and Global contexts Welsh identity, Welsh language, Welsh culture, migrants and refugees, diaspora communities

{11}------------------------------------------------

### Sample tasks

### *A Christmas Carol*:

Scrooge's redemption is not only a journey towards self-acceptance but also a catalyst for social reform, inspiring others to embrace their social responsibility. How important is it that we all play a part in wider society

### *The Woman in Black*:

Isolation is a crucial aspect of Gothic texts such as *'The Woman in Black'*. How do you think isolation affects people in 21st Century Britain and what can we do to combat this?

### *Persepolis*:

*Persepolis* explores the links between family and belonging*.* How important do you think family is in building a sense of belonging in the 21st Century?

### Preparing for the Assessment – research and planning stage

Learners are allowed **2 hours** for the research and planning stage of this task. This does not include time taken reading, studying and preparing texts with the learners.

While in the research and planning stage for this task, learners must work under indirect supervision. Learners may make use of research materials, and teachers should give advice of a general kind. The work of individual learners may be informed by working with others, but learners must then provide an individual response.

Learners are not permitted to complete any of the research and planning work related to the NEA outside of the centre.

### Resources

During the research and planning stage of this task:

- learners have access to resources and/or preparatory notes as directed by the brief or unit guidance
- learners will need to gather information from published sources when researching and planning
- learners are allowed access to the internet and any electronic and printed resources available to them. They should, however, be advised that all work must be their own – copying and pasting from internet sources, using comments from critics without acknowledgement and/or reproducing someone else's essay is plagiarism
- the use of AI to generate responses is prohibited and will be treated as malpractice.

If learners are provided with worksheets/scaffolding for the preparation of the assessment, copies of the assistance they have been given must be included with the moderation sample. Such worksheets are not permitted as part of the notes for task-taking. Comments as to the nature and amount of help given should be made on the Unit 2 non-examination assessment Candidate Mark Record sheet.

{12}------------------------------------------------

### Supervision

For the research and planning stage of this task, learners must be indirectly supervised.

The centre must ensure that:

- all candidates participate in the assessment
- there is sufficient supervision to ensure that work can be authenticated
- the work an individual candidate submits for assessment is their own.

Candidates' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be stored securely between timetabled sessions.

{13}------------------------------------------------

### Task Taking – Oracy

The presentation is expected to last between **4 and 6 minutes**. Contributions that significantly exceed or fall short of these times will be self-penalising.

To ensure fair assessment of all learners, teachers must intervene and draw the task to a close if the suggested time is exceeded. During the task, it is permissible to warn learners that their time is coming to an end.

### Resources

During the task taking stage:

- learners have access to presentational aids and preparatory notes
- learners' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be stored securely between timetabled sessions.

### Supervision

For the task taking stage, learners must be directly supervised.

The centre must ensure that:

- all candidates are within direct sight of the supervisor throughout the session(s)
- display materials which might provide assistance are removed or covered
- there is no access to e-mail, the internet or mobile phones
- candidates complete their work independently
- interaction with other candidates does not occur
- no assistance of any description is provided.

### Marking

© WJEC CBAC Ltd 2025.

Both Task A and Task B will be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC. Teachers must use the assessment criteria provided by the WJEC (see page 39). Relevant comments justifying the mark awarded should be completed on each unit coversheet.

The assessment of Task A (essay) must contain **both in-text annotations and a summative comment**. When assessing the final draft, it is important that only the candidate's own work is rewarded.

{14}------------------------------------------------

The assessment of Task B can be carried out either directly at the time of the response or by listening to the audio-visual recording at a later time. Teachers should make notes on the assessment including references to any teacher intervention – for example, to prompt a learner. This should be noted and taken into consideration when the assessment is made.

The work for this unit should be marked by teachers according to the marking criteria using a 'best fit' approach. Teachers select the band descriptors that most closely describes the quality of the work being marked. Where the candidate's work convincingly meets the descriptors, the highest mark should be awarded.

Where the candidate's work adequately meets the descriptors, a mark in the middle range should be awarded where appropriate.

Where the candidate's work just meets the descriptors, the lowest mark should be awarded.

Marking should be positive, rewarding achievement rather than penalising failure or omissions. The award of marks must be directly related to the assessment criteria.

### Moderation

Moderation will take place at two levels:

- within the centre to ensure that a uniform standard has been applied across teaching groups – this must be done in good time so that marks and samples can be submitted for the WJEC deadline
- through moderation of a sample of work by WJEC.

All learners are required to sign an authentication form to confirm that the work submitted is their own. Teachers are required to confirm that the work assessed is solely that of the learner concerned and was conducted under the required conditions.

A copy of the authentication form, which forms part of the cover sheet for each learner's work, can be found at the end of this pack.

Malpractice discovered prior to the learner signing the declaration of authentication need not be reported to WJEC but must be dealt with in accordance with the centre's internal procedures.

### Teacher Guidance

© WJEC CBAC Ltd 2025.

The level of guidance teachers may give throughout the assessment of this unit are as follows:

| Review candidates' work and provide oral and written advice at a general level in order to secure a functional outcome.  | ✓ |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| Evaluate progress to date and propose broad approaches for improvement.                                                  | ✓ |
| Provide detailed specific advice on how to improve drafts to meet assessment criteria.                                   | x |
| Give detailed feedback on errors and omissions which leave candidates with no opportunity to show initiative themselves. | x |
| Intervene personally to improve the presentation or content of work.                                                     | x |

{15}------------------------------------------------

N.B. In all levels of guidance, teachers are permitted to intervene/advise on issues of safety or wellbeing.

### Collaboration during the tasks

For Task A, collaboration is not permitted. Learners must not collaborate in any way during the task.

For Task B, collaboration is partially permitted. Learners are not permitted to work in groups but are permitted to comment on each other's work in controlled conditions during the research and planning stage, for example as part of teacher-sanctioned peer feedback. All work produced must be the learner's own.

# WJEC GCSE English Language and Literature

<span id="page-25-0"></span>Candidate Assessment Pack (3750U2)

Unit 2: Belonging

{27}------------------------------------------------

### About this pack: information and instructions for candidates

This candidate assessment pack is for candidates completing Unit 2 – Belonging.

Within this pack, you will find:

- information for candidates, which tells you about things that you must and must not do when you are completing the assessment
- a Declaration Form
- a Time Record sheet.

### Task A

**You will have 5 hours in total to complete this assessment.** You should spend:

- 3 hours completing the research and planning stage
- 2 hours completing the final assessment

### Task B

**You will have just over 3 hours in total to complete this assessment.** You should spend:

- 2 hours completing the research and planning stage
- 4-6 minutes completing the final assessment

You will be supervised throughout the assessment. For the research and planning stage you will be indirectly supervised. For the task-taking stage you will be directly supervised.

Your teacher is allowed to help you to understand the assessment requirements briefs and the task, but there are rules about the kind of help and how much they can give you. You should speak to your teacher if you have any questions about what you are and are not allowed to do as you are completing the tasks, as they will know how much help they are allowed to give you.

It is important that you work independently from other candidates and the work produced should be your own unaided work. You and your teacher will be required to sign a declaration that all work presented is your own work.

You are advised to check your work carefully to make sure that it is accurate and correct.

{28}------------------------------------------------

### Information for candidates

The following information has been taken from the [JCQ Information for candidates –](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) non[examination assessments](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) and the [JCQ Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) Use in Assessments:](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/)  [Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/) This tells you about things that you **must** and **must not** do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not understand, you **must** ask your teacher.

### Preparing your work

- When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you need to ensure that your final product reflects your own independent work and isn't copied or paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
- If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you **must** tell your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
- If you worked as part of a group on a task, you **must** each write up your own account of the assignment. Even if the data you have is the same, you **must** describe in your own words how that data was obtained, and you **must** independently draw your own conclusions from the data.
- Take care of your work and keep it safe. **Do not** leave it lying around where your classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You **must** always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; **do not** share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
- **Do not** be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI tools and chatbots) – this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort of copying.
- You **must not** write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

# Plagiarism

Plagiarism involves taking someone else's words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them off as your own. **It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously.** Don't think you won't be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:

- Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
- Markers are highly experienced subject specialists they may have read the source you are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!
- Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and style of writing or punctuation.

# Penalties for breaking the regulations

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be applied:

- the piece of work will be awarded zero marks
- you will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question
- you will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series
- you will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

**Remember – it's your qualification so it needs to be your own work.**
