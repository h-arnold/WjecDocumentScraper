## Instructions for teachers

Along with the instructions in this handbook teachers must read the relevant details in the specification for the Single and Double award of this qualification.

Teachers must also read the JCQ document, Instructions for conducting non-examination assessments for detailed advice relating to the administration of non-examination assessment.

Assessment will be based on two tasks. For Task A, learners will be required to respond to one of two prescribed tasks on their studied prose text.

For Task B, the learners will be required to deliver an individually researched presentation based on the theme of Belonging and linked to their text studied for Task A; teachers should work with learners on aspects of Belonging that interest them in developing a title for this task. An audio-visual recording must be made for each learner.

The assessment criteria for both tasks can be found on page 15.

Teachers must complete the Unit 2 Assessment Record Sheet for all learners (found on the WJEC GCSE English Language and Literature webpage) and submit to WJEC for those learners included in the moderation sample.

The submission deadline for Unit 2 samples of work is 17 March annually. The work must be uploaded by e-submission.

## Task A

## The task

The essay task will be prescribed by WJEC. Centres may tailor the title of the task to suit their chosen text ensuring accessibility and relevance for their learners while maintaining the required level of analytical depth and rigour.

The task will be released in April the year before assessment. The same task will remain for two years. Centres are required to ensure they use the correct task for each series. Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the course learners undertake the task.

The essay will be linked to learners' understanding of Belonging developed through the study of a prose text from the longlist. Learners will use a range of linguistic and literary approaches to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the whole text, exploring the theme of Belonging through the study of character(s) and/or setting.

Areas based on the theme of Belonging that could be considered include, but are not limited to:

- a) familial belonging
- b) cultural belonging
- c) social belonging
- d) locational belonging
- e) self-belonging
- f) anything counter to belonging such as: exclusion, isolation, alienation, disconnection.

## Learners should:

- give a sustained response, reflecting an understanding of the text as a whole
- use linguistic and literary approaches, including an analysis of the language, structure and form choices made by the writer and the effect of these on the reader
- use context to inform analysis of the prose text
- have a clear and developing argument that addresses the question directly and a conclusion summing up the content of the response and drawing the analysis/evaluation together.

In tailoring the generic task, there is no expectation that all learners in a centre will use the same text or the same title in completing this unit.



{6}------------------------------------------------



## Preparing for the assessment - Research and planning stage

It is important that centres have already read, studied and prepared the texts with learners before they start this process.

Learners are allowed 3 hours for the research and planning stage of this task. This does not include time taken reading, studying and preparing texts with the learners.

Learners are not permitted to complete any of the research and planning work related to the NEA outside of the centre.

## Resources

During the research and planning stage of this task:

- learners may have access to dictionaries and thesauri
- learners can have access to resources and/or preparatory notes. They should, however, be advised that all work must be their own - copying and pasting from internet sources, using comments from critics without acknowledgement and/or reproducing someone else's essay is plagiarism
- the use of AI to generate responses is prohibited and will be treated as malpractice
- learners' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be stored securely between timetabled sessions.

If learners are provided with worksheets/scaffolding for the preparation of the assessment, copies of the assistance they have been given must be included with the moderation sample. Such worksheets are not permitted as part of the notes for task-taking. Comments as to the nature and amount of help given should be made on the Unit 2 Assessment Record Sheet.

## Supervision

For the research and planning stage of this task, learners must be indirectly supervised.

Centres must ensure that:

- all learners participate in the assessment
- there is sufficient supervision to ensure that work can be authenticated
- the work an individual learner submits for assessment is their own.



{7}------------------------------------------------



## Task taking - Essay writing

The final task must be completed under direct supervision.

Learners are allowed a total of 2 hours to complete this task. This time allowance may be split up into shorter periods to suit the centre and may include any redrafting if required. If the assessment session is broken up into shorter periods of time, all learners' work must be collected and kept securely within the centre.

## Resources

During the task taking stage:

- learners are not permitted to use notes in the assessment session. They may have access to a clean copy of the text: this should be the whole text and not extracts. The text must be checked for notes/essay plans to prevent any incidents of malpractice
- work may be handwritten or digitally produced. No access to dictionaries or thesauri is permitted during task-taking, and digital grammar and spell check programmes must be disabled
- once the work is completed by the learner in this two-hour period, it may not be revised.

## Supervision

For the task taking stage, learners must be directly supervised.

Centres must ensure that:

- all learners are within direct sight of the supervisor throughout the session(s)
- display materials which might provide assistance are removed or covered
- there is no access to email, the internet or mobile phones
- learners complete their work independently
- interaction with other learners does not occur
- no assistance of any description is provided.



{8}------------------------------------------------



## Task B

## Development of the task

The task must focus on a theme, issue, representation or relationship linked to Belonging and inspired by the studied prose text.

Different tasks may be developed by the teacher to meet the needs of individual learners, or for a whole class or cohort if appropriate. WJEC examples of tasks may be used or modified by centres if appropriate to meet the needs of their learners.

<!-- image -->

## Unit 2 Task B must:

- have a clearly defined focus to give learners the opportunity to show their understanding of an aspect linked to Belonging
- give opportunities for research to support the presentation with statistics, facts, evidence as well as examples from texts
- allow learners to present and develop ideas on their selected topic.

## Possible aspects for investigation

- Relationships - family dynamics, friendship groups, belonging at different life stages
- Diversity - multicultural belonging, celebrations and traditions from different cultures, bilingualism/language barriers
- Wales and Global contexts - Welsh identity, Welsh language, Welsh culture, migrants and refugees, diaspora communities.



{9}------------------------------------------------



## Preparing for the assessment - research and planning stage

Learners are allowed 2 hours for the research and planning stage of this task. This does not include time taken reading, studying and preparing texts with the learners.

While in the research and planning stage for this task, learners must work under indirect supervision. Learners may make use of research materials, and teachers should give advice of a general kind. The work of individual learners may be informed by working with others, but learners must then provide an individual response.

Learners are not permitted to complete any of the research and planning work related to the NEA outside of the centre.

## Resources

During the research and planning stage of this task:

- learners will need to gather information from published sources when researching and planning
- learners are allowed access to the internet and any electronic and printed resources available to them. They should, however, be advised that all work must be their own copying and pasting from internet sources, using comments from critics without acknowledgement and/or reproducing someone else's essay is plagiarism
- the use of AI to generate responses is prohibited and will be treated as malpractice.

If learners are provided with worksheets/scaffolding for the preparation of the assessment, copies of the assistance they have been given must be included with the moderation sample. Such worksheets or scaffolding are not permitted as part of the learner's notes for task-taking. Comments as to the nature and amount of help given should be made on the Unit 2 Assessment Record Sheet.

## Supervision

For the research and planning stage of this task, learners must be indirectly supervised.

Centres must ensure that:

- all learners participate in the assessment
- there is sufficient supervision to ensure that work can be authenticated
- the work an individual learner submits for assessment is their own.

Learners' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be stored securely between timetabled sessions.



{10}------------------------------------------------



## Task taking - Oracy

The presentation is expected to last between 4 and 6 minutes . Contributions that significantly fall short of these times will be self-penalising.

To ensure fair assessment of all learners, teachers must intervene and draw the task to a close if the suggested time is exceeded. During the task, it is permissible to warn learners that their time is coming to an end.

| Learners                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Teachers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Learners may use information technology such as PowerPoint, or other presentational aids such as handouts, but only as a resource to facilitate the presentation. It must be emphasised that this is not a reading task, but rather an oral presentation prepared by the learner. | During the learner's individual researched presentation, the teacher should: • make an audio-visual recording of the presentation • give the learner an opportunity to present independently • ensure that the learner does not read their presentation • interrupt or prompt only when necessary. |
| Learners may use short bullet points in their presentational aid that include, for example, statistics, facts, examples or relevant quotations. They must not use scripted notes for this assessment.                                                                             | Teachers should retain all presentational aids used at the end of the presentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Resources

During the task taking stage:

- learners have access to presentational aids and preparatory notes
- learners' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be stored securely between timetabled sessions.

{11}------------------------------------------------



## Marking instructions

Both Task A and Task B will be marked by the centre and moderated by WJEC. Teachers must use the assessment criteria provided by WJEC (see page 13). Relevant comments justifying the mark awarded should be completed on the Assessment Record Sheet.

The assessment of Task A (essay) must contain both in-text annotations and a summative comment . When assessing the final draft, it is important that only the learner's own work is rewarded.

The assessment of Task B (IRP) can be carried out either directly at the time of the response or by listening to the audio-visual recording at a later time. Teachers should make notes on the assessment including references to any teacher intervention - for example, to prompt a learner. This should be noted and taken into consideration when the assessment is made.

The work for this unit should be marked by teachers according to the marking criteria using a 'best fit' approach. Teachers select the band descriptors that most closely describe the quality of the work being marked.

- Where the learner's work convincingly meets the descriptors, the highest mark should be awarded.
- Where the learner's work adequately meets the descriptors, a mark in the middle range should be awarded where appropriate.
- Where the learner's work just meets the descriptors, the lowest mark should be awarded.

Marking should be positive, rewarding achievement rather than penalising failure or omissions. The award of marks must be directly related to the assessment criteria.

## Moderation

Moderation will take place at two levels:

- within the centre to ensure that a consistent standard has been applied across teaching groups - this must be done in good time so that marks and samples can be submitted for the WJEC deadline
- through moderation of a sample of work by WJEC.

All learners are required to sign an authentication form to confirm that the work submitted is their own. Teachers are required to confirm that the work assessed is solely that of the learner concerned and was conducted under the required conditions.

Malpractice discovered prior to the learner signing the declaration of authentication need not be reported to WJEC but must be dealt with in accordance with the centre's internal procedures.



{12}------------------------------------------------



## Teacher Guidance

The level of guidance teachers may give throughout the assessment of this unit are as follows:

| Review learner's work and provide oral and written advice at a general level in order to secure a functional outcome.   | ✓   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| Evaluate progress to date and propose broad approaches for improvement.                                                 | ✓   |
| Provide detailed specific advice on how to improve drafts to meet assessment criteria.                                  |    |
| Give detailed feedback on errors and omissions which leave learners with no opportunity to show initiative themselves.  |    |
| Intervene personally to improve the presentation or content of work.                                                    |    |

N.B. In all levels of guidance, teachers are permitted to intervene/advise on issues of safety or wellbeing.

## Collaboration during the tasks

For Task A, collaboration is not permitted. Learners must not collaborate in any way during the task.

For Task B, collaboration is partially permitted. Learners are not permitted to work in groups but are permitted to comment on each other's work in controlled conditions during the research and planning stage, for example, as part of teacher-sanctioned peer feedback. All work produced must be the learner's own.

## GCSE English Language and Literature

Unit 2: Belonging (3750U2)

Learner Assessment Pack



{14}------------------------------------------------



This assessment pack is for learners completing GCSE English Language and Literature Unit 2: Belonging.

In this pack you will find information that tells you about things you must and must not do when completing the assessments.

## Task A

There are 5 hours in total to complete this assessment. You should spend:

- 3 hours completing your research and planning for the assessment
- 2 hours completing the final assessment.

## Task B

You will have just over 2 hours to complete this assessment. You should spend:

- 2 hours completing your research and planning for the assessment
- 4-6 minutes completing the final assessment.

For both tasks, you will be supervised throughout the two stages of the assessment. For the research and planning stage, you will be indirectly supervised. This means that your teacher is allowed to help you to understand the assessment requirements and the task, but there are rules about the kind of help and how much help they can give you.

You should speak to you teacher if you have any questions about what you are and are not allowed to do as you are completing the tasks, as they will know how much help they are allowed to give you.

It is important that you work independently and that the work produced should be your own work. You and your teacher will be required to sign a declaration that all the work presented is your own work.

You are advised to check your work carefully to make sure that it is accurate and correct.



{15}------------------------------------------------



The following information has been taken from the JCQ Information for candidates - non examination assessments and the JCQ Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use in Assessments: Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications.

This tells you about things that you must and must not do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not understand, you must ask your teacher.

## INFORMATION FOR CANDIDATES

- When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you are signing to say that the work has been produced in line with the controls and guidance set out for this assessment.

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR CANDIDATES

- If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you must tell your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
- Where group work is permitted, you must each write up your own account of the assessment.
- You must always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; do not share it with anyone other than your teacher.
- Where research is required, ensure that you credit your sources (including AI) by referencing your work.
