# <span id="page-3-0"></span>Instructions for teachers

Along with the instructions in this handbook, teachers must read the relevant details in the specification for the Single and Double award of this qualification.

Teachers must also read the JCQ document, [Instructions for conducting](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/non-examination-assessments/) non-examination [assessments](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/non-examination-assessments/) for detailed advice relating to the administration of non-examination assessment.

Assessment will be based on two tasks. For Task A, the learners will be required to participate in a group discussion on one of the two prescribed tasks. An audio-visual recording must be made for each group.

For Task B, learners will be required to write a text designed to be delivered orally from a choice of five prescribed tasks.

The assessment criteria for both tasks can be found on page 15.

Teachers must complete the Unit 3 Assessment Record Sheet for **all learners** (found on the WJEC GCSE English Language and Literature webpage) and submit to WJEC for those learners included in the moderation sample.

**The submission deadline for Unit 3 samples of work is 24 March annually. The work must be uploaded by e-submission.**

# <span id="page-4-1"></span>Task A

## **The task**

WJEC will provide a choice from two selected themes as the discussion stimuli for this task, along with one prescribed text to be used in the discussion for each selection. These will be published in April the year before assessment. The same task will remain for two years. Centres are required to ensure they use the correct task for each series.

Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the course learners undertake the task. To stimulate the discussion and provide evidence for the learner's argument/ counterargument, centres must ensure the following are used:

- one text from the anthology prescribed by WJEC for the chosen theme
- one further text from the anthology must be used
- at least one of the texts referenced in the discussion must be non-continuous.

Learners may include a third text from within or outside the anthology.

The group discussion will focus on the concept of **Influence and Power**, with reference to the prescribed and selected texts.

## Learners should:

- evidence engagement with the texts studied
- use linguistic and literary approaches
- discuss their own and alternative views
- show an understanding of the ways in which they have been influenced.

{5}------------------------------------------------

#### **Preparing for the Assessment – Research and planning stage**

Learners are allowed **3 hours** for the research and planning stage of this task. This does not include time taken reading, studying and preparing texts with the learners.

While in the research and planning stage for this task, learners must work under indirect supervision. Learners may make use of research materials, and teachers may give advice of a general kind. The work of individual learners may be informed by working with others, but learners must then provide an individual response.

Learners are not permitted to complete any of the research and planning work related to the NEA outside of the centre.

## **Resources**

During the research and planning stage of this task:

- learners may gather information from published sources when researching and planning
- learners are allowed unrestricted access to the internet and any electronic and printed resources available to them. They should, however, be advised that all work must be their own – copying and pasting from internet sources, using comments from critics without acknowledgement and/or reproducing someone else's essay is plagiarism
- the use of AI to generate responses is prohibited and will be treated as malpractice
- learners' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be stored securely between timetabled sessions.

If learners are provided with worksheets/scaffolding for the preparation of their assessment, copies of the assistance they have been given must be included with the moderation sample. Such worksheets are not permitted as part of the notes for task-taking. Comments as to the nature and amount of help given should be made on the Unit 3 Assessment Record Sheet.

#### **Supervision**

For the research and planning stage of this task, learners must be indirectly supervised.

- all learners participate in the assessment
- there is sufficient supervision to ensure that work can be authenticated
- the work an individual learner submits for assessment is their own.

{6}------------------------------------------------

#### **Task taking – Discussion**

Learners are required to respond to one of the tasks provided by WJEC. The discussion is expected to last between 6 and 10 minutes. Contributions that significantly fall short of these times will be self-penalising.

To ensure fair assessment of all learners, teachers **must** intervene and draw the task to a close if the suggested time is exceeded. During the task, it is permissible to warn learners that their time is coming to an end.

| Learners                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Teachers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Learners are permitted to use annotated texts and brief notes made during the preparatory stages to inform their discussion. Annotations may focus on, for example, statistics, facts, examples or relevant quotations. | During the group discussion, the teacher should: <ul><li>make an audio-visual recording of the discussion</li><li>give learners the opportunity for independent discussion</li><li>ensure that learners do not read their contributions</li><li>ensure that learners are not responding to a script</li><li>interrupt or prompt only when necessary.</li></ul> |
| Learners must not use scripted notes of any kind for this assessment. | Teachers should retain all notes and annotated texts used by learners after the discussion. |

During the discussion, the teacher may:

- stimulate discussion or prompt participants
- encourage a change of direction
- ask a learner to provide evidence to corroborate ideas or to develop an argument.

#### **Resources**

During the task taking stage:

- learners have access to resources and/or preparatory notes as directed by the guidance above
- learners' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be stored securely.

#### **Supervision during task taking**

For the task taking stage, learners must be directly supervised.

- all candidates are within direct sight of the supervisor throughout the session(s)
- display materials which might provide assistance are removed or covered
- there is no access to e-mail, the internet or mobile phones
- candidates complete their work independently
- no assistance of any description is provided
- candidates' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be stored securely between timetabled sessions.

{7}------------------------------------------------

## <span id="page-7-0"></span>Task B

#### **The task**

WJEC will prescribe a list of stimuli for this task, from which learners will select one. Types of task may include, but are not limited to, persuasion, argument, advice, advertising, opinion or campaign writing.

The tasks will be released in April the year before assessment. The same tasks will remain for two years. Centres are required to ensure they use the correct task for each series. Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the course learners undertake the task.

Tasks will reflect one of the following themes:

- 1. Diversity
- 2. Human Rights
- 3. Relationships
- 4. Wales and Global Contexts
- 5. Work and Sustainability

Learners do not have to select the same theme for this task as for their group discussion task.

In this creative non-fiction writing task, learners will write a text designed to be delivered orally, for example a speech, talk, podcast. This text should not take the form of a transcript. All the tasks are to be written in the voice of one person.

They will apply what they have learned about **Influence and Power** to their own writing. Using a range of linguistic and literary approaches, learners will apply their knowledge and understanding of the ways of influencing a reader or listener and/or of demonstrating power in a writer/speaker/audience relationship, using ideas, opinions and techniques which they have explored in their reading of texts from the anthology.

#### Learners should:

- evidence engagement with the specified theme
- write from a position of knowledge and apply their understanding of the ways of influencing a reader/listener
- make decisions on appropriate language and register for their audience
- demonstrate their ability to influence
- show clear awareness of structure and the necessity for organised writing.

{8}------------------------------------------------

#### **Preparing for the assessment – Research and planning stage**

Learners are allowed **1 hour** for the research and planning stage of this task.

While in the planning stage for this task, learners must work under indirect supervision. Learners may make use of research materials, and teachers may give advice of a general kind. The work of individual learners may be informed by working with others, but learners must then provide an individual response.

Learners are not permitted to complete any of the planning work related to the NEA outside of the centre.

# **Resources**

During the planning stage of this task:

- learners have access to resources and/or preparatory notes. They should, however, be advised that all work must be their own – copying and pasting from internet sources, using comments from critics without acknowledgement and/or reproducing someone else's essay is plagiarism
- the use of AI to generate responses is prohibited and will be treated as malpractice
- learners may have access to dictionaries and thesauri
- learners' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be stored securely between timetabled sessions.

If learners are provided with worksheets/scaffolding for the preparation of the assessment, copies of the assistance they have been given must be included with the moderation sample. Such worksheets are not permitted as part of the notes for task-taking. Comments as to the nature and amount of help given should be made on the Unit 3 Assessment Record Sheet.

#### **Supervision**

For the planning stage of this task, learners must be indirectly supervised.

- all learners participate in the assessment
- there is sufficient supervision to ensure that work can be authenticated
- the work an individual learner submits for assessment is their own.

{9}------------------------------------------------

#### **Task taking – drafting, editing and writing**

The final task must be completed under direct supervision.

Learners are allowed a total of **1 hour 45 minutes** to complete this task. This time allowance may be split up into shorter periods to suit the centre and may include any redrafting if required. If the assessment session is broken up into shorter periods of time, all learners' work must be collected and kept securely within the centre.

Work may be handwritten or digitally produced. Grammar and spell check programmes and access to the internet must be disabled. Once the work is completed by the learner in this 1 hour 45-minute period, it may not be revised.

## **Resources**

During the task taking stage:

- learners may have access to notes made during the research and planning stage, but not to other resources
- work may be handwritten or digitally produced. No access to dictionaries or thesauri is permitted during task-taking, and digital grammar and spell check programmes must be disabled
- if learners bring their own computers or other electronic devices into supervised sessions, appropriate checks must be carried out to ensure that all material stored on the devices is permissible.

# **Supervision**

For the task taking stage, learners must be directly supervised.

- all learners are within direct sight of the supervisor throughout the session(s)
- display materials which might provide assistance are removed or covered
- there is no access to email, the internet or mobile phones
- learners complete their work independently
- interaction with other learners does not occur
- no assistance of any description is provided.

{10}------------------------------------------------

# <span id="page-10-0"></span>Marking Instructions

Task A and Task B will be marked by the centre and moderated by WJEC. Teachers must use the assessment criteria provided by WJEC (see page 13). Relevant comments justifying the mark awarded should be completed on the Assessment Record Sheet.

The assessment of Task A (discussion) can be carried out either directly at the time of the response or by listening to the audio-visual recording at a later time. Teachers should make notes on the assessment including references to any teacher intervention – for example, to prompt a learner. This should be noted and taken into consideration when the assessment is made.

The assessment of Task B (creative writing) must contain **both in-text annotations and a summative comment**. When assessing the final draft, it is important that only the candidate's own work is rewarded.

The work for this unit should be marked by teachers according to the marking criteria using a 'best fit' approach. Teachers select the band descriptors that most closely describe the quality of the work being marked.

- Where the candidate's work convincingly meets the descriptors, the highest mark should be awarded.
- Where the candidate's work adequately meets the descriptors, the mark in the middle range should be awarded where appropriate.
- Where the candidate's work just meets the descriptors, the lowest mark should be awarded.

Marking should be positive, rewarding achievement rather than penalising failure or omissions. The awarding of marks must be directly related to the assessment criteria.

#### **Moderation**

Moderation will take place at two levels:

- within the centre to ensure that a consistent standard has been applied across teaching groups – this must be done in good time so that marks and samples can be submitted by the WJEC deadline
- through moderation of a sample of work by WJEC.

All learners are required to sign an authentication form to confirm that the work submitted is their own. Teachers are required to confirm that the work assessed is solely that of the learner concerned and was conducted under the required conditions.

Malpractice discovered prior to the learner signing the declaration of authentication need not be reported to WJEC but must be dealt with in accordance with the centre's internal procedures.

{11}------------------------------------------------

#### **Teacher Guidance**

The level of guidance teachers may give throughout the assessment of this unit are as follows:

| Review learners' work and provide oral and written advice at a general level in order to secure a functional outcome. |  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| Evaluate progress to date and propose broad approaches for improvement.                                                     | ✓ |
| Provide detailed specific advice on how to improve drafts to meet assessment criteria. |  |
| Give detailed feedback on errors and omissions which leave candidates with no opportunity to show initiative themselves. |  |
| Intervene personally to improve the presentation or content of work.                                                        |   |

N.B. In all levels of guidance, teachers are permitted to intervene/advise on issues of safety or wellbeing.

# **Collaboration during the tasks**

For Task A, collaboration is permitted. During both preparation and task-taking learners are permitted to work in groups.

#### However:

- although it is acceptable for all members of the group to use the same research, each learner must use their own words to present their ideas and draw their own conclusions
- preparation time should not be used to rehearse the discussion.

Whilst group work may be permitted, group assessment is not. Members of the group will have made different contributions and the work of each learner must be individually assessed and therefore will not receive the same mark.

The teacher's record must describe the individual learner's contribution to any group work.

#### For Task B:

Collaboration is not permitted. Learners must not collaborate in any way during the task.
