# WJEC GCSE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE (SINGLE AND DOUBLE AWARD)

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

{1}------------------------------------------------

#### **Q: What are the purposes of the Single and Double Awards?**

A: The double award has been introduced to provide the most appropriate qualification for most learners and should be offered by all schools. The single award provides an alternative route for the small proportion of learners who would benefit from a smaller qualification, given their circumstances. Given that the difference between the qualifications is breadth – the volume of work required – the SA may be more appropriate for a learner who, for example, has had a long-term absence from school and could not cover the amount of content required for the DA. Both qualifications are designed to be completed over two years.

#### **Q: How can we access the texts for study across all units?**

A: The Poetry anthology for Units 1 and 5, the Non-Fiction anthology for Units 3 and 6 and the list of prose texts for Unit 2 are available digitally on the WJEC qualifications [webpage.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/qualifications/gcse-english-language-and-literature-double-and-single-award-teaching-from-2025/#tab_keydocuments) The anthologies will be reviewed and refreshed when necessary. The choice of texts for Units 4a and 4b are indicated within the specification.

## **Q: What information is included in the Assessment Packs?**

A: Sample exam questions, details of NEA tasks, mark schemes for all tasks, explanation of timings and expectations for controlled conditions, advice on the planning process, expectations for marking and moderation, assessment objectives and their breakdown across different tasks.

## **Q: In Unit 1, how many supplementary poems need to be selected for study in addition to the 10 anthology poems?**

A: As many as would adequately prepare learners for the unseen poetry questions they will have in Unit 1. The specification clarifies that the supplementary poems should be from the 19th and 20th centuries and cover different forms. These must include sonnet, elegy, ballad and blank verse. In the exam, learners will be assessed on one poem from the anthology and one unseen poem.

#### **Q: In Unit 1, what is meant by the contexts of poems?**

A: The specification offers the following as examples: socio-historical contexts; cultural influences; authorial context; literary context; period; status/power. Alongside these, learners could also consider their own context and its influence on interpretation and response. The Assessment Pack provides further detail of how context will be assessed.

**Q: In Unit 1, Section B, will there always be one fiction task and one non-fiction task?** A: Yes.

#### **Q: When will we receive the NEA briefs for Units 2, 3 and 5?**

A: The NEA briefs will be released in April, including the prescribed WJEC texts. In the first year of the qualifications, Summer 2026, only Units 2 and 3 will be available.

{2}------------------------------------------------

#### **Q: Will NEAs be submitted in year 10?**

A: This depends on how centres structure delivery. Units 2 and 3 are first available for assessment in Summer 2026, so could theoretically be entered and submitted for external moderation then.

#### **Q: When can Units 2 and 3 be cashed in?**

A: First entries for units 2 and 3 will be Summer 2026. A cash-in can only be applied when all units that make up the qualification have been sat and entered.

#### **Q: Is there an expectation that all oracy assessments are recorded audio visually?**

A: Yes. If there is a reason a learner cannot be filmed, then a centre should contact Special Requirements/GCSE English for advice.

## **Q: Will we be provided with a list of writing types that we need to teach?**

A: There will not be prescribed lists of text types to cover; the specification does list some examples. Text purpose is more important than text type.

## **Q: What is meant by "literary and linguistic approaches"?**

A: Integrated linguistic and literary approaches encourage learners to select and apply their knowledge of terminology from both linguistic and literary disciplines in meaningful ways. This should be the basis for all their analysis, making their arguments focused and purposeful. An integrated approach is not about being able to label words or written features, and learners will not get credit for observing techniques without commenting on the meaning and the effects created. Feature spotting is a limiting approach because it shows no evidence of interpretation – and learners should always read for meaning.

## **Q: Will we be given guidance on the terminology that we will need to cover from linguistic and literary perspectives?**

A: The Guidance for Teaching will feature a glossary that defines terminology that could be expected at this level.

## **Q: Do the sample questions about word class and similes (the restricted questions) encourage technique spotting?**

A: The low tariff questions test learners' knowledge of linguistic and literary terminology. This is different from 'linguistic and literary approaches' needed for the extended analytical responses. Feature spotting will gain little credit so learners should ensure that they use terminology from both disciplines to explore how meaning is created.

#### **Q: Will exams only be available in the summer series?**

A: No, we are also offering a November series for the examined units.

{3}------------------------------------------------

#### **Q: Will exams be closed text?**

A: Yes. There will be extract questions, and in Unit 4a/4b an essay question assessing engagement with the whole text. Any text that candidates need to closely reference will be printed in the assessment materials.

## **Q: What do the Blended Learning Resources cover and will they be available in a downloadable format?**

A: The Blended Learning Resources provide lessons on all the examination texts for Units 1, 4a, 4b and 6. In addition, there are resources for teaching non-fiction and creative literary writing effectively. (Pending answer for part 2)

## **Q: Is there an optimal teaching order for these units?**

A: Units can be taught in any order, but centres may wish to build delivery around the availability of assessment opportunities as outlined in the specification. Please note that NEA briefs will not be published until the April before the year of entry.

## **Q: Will there be marking support for teachers?**

A: Yes. Further guidance to support teachers marking the NEA tasks will be provided in the coming twelve months.

## **Q: When will centres be required to submit samples and marks for NEA?**

A: Pending answer

## **Q: How will these qualifications work for post-16 learners?**

A: Pending answer

#### **Q: How will NEA be submitted for moderation?**

A: All NEA will be submitted for moderation on IAMIS.
