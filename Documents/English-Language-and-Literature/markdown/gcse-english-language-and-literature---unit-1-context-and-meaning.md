John Cooper Clarke became famous in the late 1970s and 1980s and is known as a 'punk poet'. In 'i wanna be yours' he is addressing a woman.

#### **i wanna be yours**

let me be your vacuum cleaner breathing in your dust let me be your ford cortina\* i will never rust 5 if you like your coffee hot let me be your coffee pot you call the shots i wanna be yours

- 10 let me be your raincoat for those frequent rainy days let me be your dreamboat when you wanna sail away let me be your teddy bear 15 take me with you anywhere i don't care i wanna be yours
- let me be your electric meter 20 i will not run out let me be the electric heater you get cold without let me be your setting lotion hold your hair 25 with deep devotion deep as the deep atlantic ocean that's how deep is my emotion deep deep deep deep de deep deep 30 i don't wanna be hers i wanna be yours

#### **Valentine (1993)**

Not a red rose or a satin heart.

I give you an onion. It is a moon wrapped in brown paper. 5 It promises light like the careful undressing of love.

Here.

It will blind you with tears

10 like a lover. It will make your reflection a wobbling photo of grief.

I am trying to be truthful.

15

Not a cute card or a kissogram.

I give you an onion. Its fierce kiss will stay on your lips, 20 possessive and faithful as we are, for as long as we are.

Take it.

25 Its platinum loops shrink to a wedding ring, if you like. Lethal. Its scent will cling to your fingers, cling to your knife.

Carol Ann Duffy

#### **MARK SCHEME**

#### **Guidance for examiners**

#### **Generic marking principles**

- Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
- Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.
- Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
- Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

#### **Positive marking**

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising candidates for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates' answers. The list is not exhaustive. The inclusion of *'Credit any other valid response.*' (or similar instruction) within mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates' responses. Credit should be given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates' answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However, unless there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks where the answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

#### **Banded mark schemes**

For band marked questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in candidates' answers. It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate's response. As noted above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive and candidates do not have to include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been provided, no marks should be awarded.

{19}------------------------------------------------

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each candidate's response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills, knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors or omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate's answer to pick out the evidence that is being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied. This is done as a two-stage process.

#### **Stage 1 – Deciding on the band**

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate's answer and check whether it matches the descriptors for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the descriptors most closely match the work.

#### **Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark**

Having determined the appropriate band, deciding on the mark within a band will be made on the basis of a 'best fit' procedure, weaknesses in some areas being compensated for by strengths in others.

Examiners should use the full range of marks available to them. Marking should be positive, rewarding achievement rather that penalising failure or omissions. The awarding of marks must be directly related to the marking criteria, and all responses must be marked according to the banded levels provided for each question.

Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be provided during standardising and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work. Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the standardising material as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the work submitted.

This mark scheme instructs examiners to look for and reward valid alternatives where indicative content is suggested for an answer. This is not a checklist for expected content in an answer, or set out as a 'model answer', as responses must be marked in the banded levels of response provided for each question. Where a candidate provides a response that contains aspects or approaches not included in the indicative content, examiners should use their professional judgement to determine the validity of the response in light of the task and reward as directed by the bands. Candidates are free to choose any approach that is relevant to the set task. Candidates can (and will most likely) incorporate ideas other than those mentioned in the mark scheme.

#### **Section A Reading**

|  | Question | Answer | AO1 | AO2 | Total Mark |
|----|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|-----|---------------|
| 1. | (a) | What is the word class of the two words from the first line of 'Valentine' underlined below: 'Not a red rose or a satin heart.' | [1] |  | [1] |
|  |  | Award one mark for the term adjective or the term modifier, one mark maximum. |  |  |  |
|  | (b) | Explain the effect that the words red and satin have in the poem. | [4] |  | [4] |
|  |  | Award one mark to those who give a straightforward explanation of the effect of the word 'red', for instance saying that it makes the rose sound bright or romantic. Reward valid alternatives. |  |  |  |
|  |  | Award one mark to those who give a straightforward explanation of the effect of the word 'satin', for instance saying that it makes it the heart sound luxurious, romantic or made of material. Reward valid alternatives. |  |  |  |
|  |  | Award up to two marks to those who give a more detailed explanation of how either of both of these words are used to achieve effects. |  |  |  |
|  |  | For instance: <ul><li>The word satin suggests that the gift is fake/superficial</li><li>The word red suggests that the gift is a very familiar, perhaps cliched one</li><li>These two words emphasise that they are commercial, standard Valentine gifts.</li></ul> |  |  |  |
|  |  | Reward valid alternatives. If only one of the two words is referred to then award a maximum of two marks. |  |  |  |

Ideas candidates might explore may include::

- The poet is giving an unusual gift, an onion, which is different to traditional Valentine's gifts such as red roses and satin hearts
- She is giving an unusual gift because it is a more accurate representation of love (layers, causes pain, lethal etc.) (I am trying to be truthful)
- The poet is insistent about the gift when she says 'Here' and 'Take it' for example
- Gifts have consequences, and these are definite, recognised by the words 'it will'.
- Emotions are created by the giving of love, and these can be painful (wobbling photo of grief, cling to your knife etc.)
- The gift of an onion is a physical metaphor for the giving of love.

These answers should show an understanding of the writer's craft and are able to make thoughtful inferences. Give 5 marks to those who make accurate and perceptive comments about how meaning is created supported by wellselected examples and purposeful textual references. These answers will include more insightful inferences and an assured understanding of the writer's craft. Ideas candidates might explore may include: • The poet repeats the word 'let' to emphasise the pleading nature of his request • The poet repeats 'let me' to show that he should be the lover rather than anyone else • The poet repeats 'you' and 'yours' to emphasise that the address is to this one specific woman and that the power is hers and the focus is on her • The poet repeats the phrase 'let me be yours' to emphasise the strength and/or urgency of his request. He is insistent • The poet repeats the phrase 'i wanna be yours' at the end of each stanza to create a refrain that emphasises the exact nature of his request, saying that he wants to belong to her just like the possessions he has listed.

|  | Using linguistic and literary approaches, explain to what extent you agree with this statement. Remember to discuss the contexts of the poems where appropriate in your answer. |  |  |  |
|  | In your response, you could: <ul><li>explain what the poems are about</li><li>compare different aspects of the poems</li><li>discuss how themes and ideas are presented and structured</li><li>explore the poets' choices of words, phrases and images, and the effects they create</li><li>give your personal response to the poems.</li></ul> |  |  |  |

#### **Indicative Content**

Look for and reward all valid interpretations. These might include:

- Cooper Clark presents love in a stereotypical masculine way, intending to woo his wouldbe lover, whereas Duffy's representation of love could be seen as more traditionally female rooted in the day-to-day small gestures found in relationships.
- that 'Valentine' is expressing a negative but more realistic view of love
- that 'Valentine' shows that love is about honesty and pain as well as gifts
- that 'Valentine' is a contextual attack on the commercialisation of Valentine's Day
- that 'i wanna be yours' is positive in its presentation of the unselfish aspects of love
- that 'i wanna be yours can be seen as presenting a less mature and more idealistic view of love than 'Valentine'
- that the writer's context for 'i wanna be yours' can be related to its tone in presenting love through everyday images such as the coffee pot
- that both poems show different aspects of love and could both be seen as positive in different ways.

The most successful responses will include consideration of a range of detail from both poems to support an insightful analysis of how love is presented in each. This will be compared and related to various contexts. Answers will be confident and detailed, focusing on the way that love is presented as positive or otherwise in the two poems. There will be some sensitivity, and, towards the top of this mark range, evidence of evaluation. There will be some assured analysis of the ways the writers use literary and linguistic techniques. There will be a focus on how contextual factors might affect a reading of the poems. Comparison will be detailed and valid, with insight into the different ways in which love is presented in the two poems.

Less successful responses will be underdeveloped and based on a simple understanding of one or both poems showing a basic awareness of the presentation of love. There may be awareness of the context of the poems perhaps including that of the reader. Responses at this level may sometimes be general and rely on any potential links to own experiences. There may be some attempt at comparison between the poems.

**10.** For Question 10 the most successful responses are likely to:

- Establish two clear characters and the situation in which the advice is given
- Establish a tone for the advice, perhaps an informal conversation or a more formal warning of the possible pitfalls
- Include advice that is detailed and specific
- Employ humour, or another identifiable dynamic between the characters, such as jealousy, concern or control
- Have a significant end point. Even though this is an extract from a longer work there should be a relevant and clearly identifiable ending to the exchange between the characters
- Use the advice expressed to highlight the strength or limitations of the relationship between the characters or to focus more on the strength or limitations of one of the characters.
