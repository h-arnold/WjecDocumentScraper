## 1. NEW GCSE English Language and Literature Update

As we work through the early stages of the new GCSE English Language and Literature qualifications, please do keep in touch with the subject team with your queries and observations, telling us what you need and what you like, so we can ensure that you are confident in your delivery and put our resources into making you feel confident and wellsupported.

September 2024 was the final time centres should have begun delivery of a two-year course for the WJEC GCSE legacy qualifications.

From September 2025, learners must not be entered into these legacy GCSEs in Year 10 in subjects where reformed GCSEs are available.

The NEA briefs for Units 2 and 3 were published on the WJEC Portal in April and the Unit 5 NEA brief in June 2025. Details of the conditions relevant to task-setting, task-taking and task-marking are published in each unit's brief. Further details around the NEA tasks and marking will be provided through the autumn term and part of WJEC's continuing Professional Learning programme.

As a reminder, the first examination available to learners will be Unit 1 in summer 2026, with Units 1 and 4b available in November 2026. All examined units will be available in summer 2027 and for each series thereafter.

## 2. Resources

For the new qualification, there are a wide range of engaging resources tailored to support you in delivering the WJEC English Language and Literature GCSE. These can be found on the Digital Resources page.

Our Blended Learning Resources and Knowledge Organisers are designed to complement traditional face-to-face teaching with an online learning pack that allows learners to work at their own pace. They can be used as revision tools, as part of catch-up, or for flipped learning.

Our Blended Learning Resources can be accessed here:

Creative Writing Non-Fiction Writing Non-Fiction: Diversity Non-Fiction: Human Rights Non-Fiction: Relationships Non-Fiction: Wales and Global Contexts Non-Fiction: Work and Sustainability Play: A Midsummer Night's Dream Play: Pygmalion Play: An Inspector Calls Play DNA Play: Leave Taking Play: Refugee Boy Play: The Importance of Being Earnest Poetry: Children and Parents Poetry: Conflict Poetry: Identity Poetry: Relationships Poetry: The Natural World

Prose: Animal Farm

Prose: My Name is Leon

Prose: Pigeon

## Our Knowledge Organisers can be accessed here:

Unit 1: Poetry (Context and Meaning) Unit 4a: Drama (Motivations) Unit 4b: Drama (Motivations) Unit 4b: Prose (Motivations) Unit 6: Non-Fiction (Connections)

Sample Assessment Materials are available within the Key Documents tab on the WJEC GCSE English Language and Literature subject page. These documents contain sample examination papers and detailed marking guidelines.

The Guidance for Teaching document is designed to support teachers in the delivery of WJEC GCSE English Language and Literature. It is not intended as a comprehensive reference, but as support for teachers to develop stimulating and exciting courses tailored to the needs and skills of their learners. The guide offers course plans, possible classroom activities and links to useful resources (including our own, freely available digital materials) to provide ideas for immersive and engaging lessons.

## Guidance for Teaching spotlight: The Glossary

The glossary is provided within the Guidance for Teaching as a guide to support teachers and learners. It defines terms that will be useful in preparing learners for the WJEC GCSE English qualification; it is not intended to be definitive nor a checklist. Hopefully, teachers will see the glossary as a suggestion of the terms that could be introduced to learners to help them develop their analytical toolkit.

Learners will not be credited for feature-spotting but should know some of the terms provided to engage better with how meaning has been constructed and to comment

productively on the effects such features create. In turn, they will then be able to deliberately and effectively employ the features in their own writing and speaking.

The key terms have been grouped to support understanding and planning when tackling specific areas of learning.

## 3. Professional Learning

The materials from the pan-Wales Preparing to Teach clusters are available on Portal. Included in these materials is the Spoken Language session with an audio commentary, offering an overview of ways to teach the spoken language elements of the new qualification.

Exam Walkthroughs and NEA Walkthroughs are now available on Portal. These resources offer practical hints and tips on how to effectively approach questions in the examination papers and the NEA. Using questions from the Sample Assessment Materials, the PowerPoint with audio help and audio script in the notes will walk learners through the assessments, helping them revise and practise useful exam techniques.

## Past Papers

Remember that 26 September is the last date for receipt of applications for Reviews of Marking and Reviews of Moderation (ROMMAs) and for the request of electronic copies of scripts for teaching and learning purposes. Please see our website for more details.

If you haven't already seen your NEA moderation report, you can access this via the secure Portal. Click on 'Internal Assessment' then the relevant examination series (e.g. GCSE English Literature Summer 2025) and you will be able to 'View Moderator Report'. Moderators' reports can only be downloaded until the 31 December 2025.

For the summer 2025 series, a free, unannotated scripts service is available for GCSE English Language (3700U20-1 and 3700U30-1) and GCSE English Literature (3720U10-1, 3720UA0-1, 3720U20-1, 3720UB0-1, 3720U30-1 and 3720UC0-1). Centres can download scripts on behalf of candidates via WJEC Portal which also includes instructions on the process.

## 2. Analysing Candidates Results

WJEC offers two services to help you understand your learners' results and develop their exam skills: Exam Results Analysis and Online Exam Review.

Exam Results Analysis on the Portal allows you to compare your learners' performance on each question with that of the candidature overall, letting you see where they have done well and where there might be room for improvement. To do this, under the 'Results' tab, click on 'View/Print Item Level Data' or 'View/Print Centre Performance' for comparable data.

Online Exam Review provides a number of marked exemplars, from previous years, of candidate responses to key questions in an interactive format. These allow learners to mark others' work and discuss ways in which it may be improved, thus developing their own skills. There will be no exemplars from 2025 for the legacy qualifications but exemplars from the Summer 2024 examinations are available on the Portal for GCSE English Language and GCSE English Literature.

Please read them carefully as they provide helpful observations and commentary on candidates' performance across the examined series that could help prepare learners for the next series. Each report has a handy bullet pointed list at the end of each section to summarise key point and areas of concern and success as well as links to useful resources at the beginning of the report.
