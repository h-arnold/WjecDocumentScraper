## <span id="page-4-0"></span>Task A

#### **Overview**

Task A is an essay.

The suggested length is 1000-1500 words.

The total time learners are allowed to spend on research and planning is **3 hours**.

The total time learners are allowed to spend on the final assessment is **3 hours**.

Marks available: **30**

The essay task will be chosen from a selection of tasks prescribed by WJEC.

Tasks will be released during the first week of April for assessment in the following academic year. The same task will remain for two years. Centres are required to ensure they use the correct question for each series. Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the year learners undertake the task.

The essay will be linked to learners' understanding of continuity and change developed through a critical discussion of the Shakespeare play in the light of the question set. This could focus on areas such as character and relationships, plot and dramatic structure, specific elements of language, or differences and similarities in contemporary and twentyfirst century attitudes.

#### **Sample Task**

Theme: Changing Attitudes

Explore the ways that attitudes are presented throughout your studied play by Shakespeare and how these are different or the same to a modern audience. 

#### **Sample titles**

- 1. Explore how attitudes to family are presented in *Romeo and Juliet* and how attitudes are different or the same for a modern audience.
- 2. Explore how attitudes to war and conflict are presented in *Henry V* and how attitudes are different or the same for a modern audience.
- 3. Explore how attitudes to love are presented in *Much Ado About Nothing* and how attitudes are different or the same for a modern audience.

The NEA released in April 2026 will include an additional theme as a choice.

{5}------------------------------------------------

#### Learners should:

- evidence engagement with the whole play
- show their understanding of the play and their understanding of continuity and change in context
- use linguistic and literary approaches
- use context to inform analysis of the play, examining their effect on meaning/audience responses
- select and evaluate relevant examples from the play
- have a clear and developing argument that addresses the question directly and a conclusion that draws the argument together.

#### **Preparing for the Assessment – Research and planning stage**

It is important that centres have already read, studied and prepared the whole Shakespeare play with learners before they begin this stage.

Learners are allowed **3 hours** for the research and planning stage of this task. This does not include time taken reading, studying and preparing texts with the learners.

While in the research and planning stage for this task, learners must work under indirect supervision. They may make use of research materials, and teachers may give advice of a general kind. The work of individual learners may be informed by working with others, but learners must then provide an individual response.

Learners are not permitted to complete any of the research and planning work related to the NEA outside of the centre.

#### **Resources**

During the research and planning stage of this task:

- learners can have access to resources and/or preparatory notes. They should, however, be advised that all work must be their own – copying and pasting from internet sources, using comments from critics without acknowledgement and/or reproducing someone else's essay is plagiarism
- the use of AI to generate responses is prohibited and will be treated as malpractice
- learners may have access to dictionaries and thesauri
- learners' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be stored securely between timetabled sessions.

If learners bring their own computers or other electronic devices into supervised sessions, appropriate checks must be carried out to ensure that all materials stored on the devices are permissible.

If learners are provided with worksheets/scaffolding for their assessment, copies of the assistance they have been given must be included with the moderation sample. Such worksheets are not permitted as part of the notes for task-taking. Comments as to the nature and amount of help given should be made on the Unit 5 non-examination assessment Candidate Mark Record Sheet. Candidate Mark record Sheets for each series must be downloaded from the WJEC website.

{6}------------------------------------------------

#### **Supervision**

For the research and planning stage of this task, learners must be indirectly supervised:

The centre must ensure that:

- all candidates participate in the assessment
- there is sufficient supervision to ensure that work can be authenticated
- the work an individual candidate submits for assessment is their own.

#### **Task Taking – Essay Writing**

Following the completion of the preparation stage, the task must be completed under direct supervision.

Learners are allowed a total of **3 hours** to complete this task. This time allowance may be split up into shorter periods to suit the centre and may include redrafting if required.

If the assessment session is broken up into shorter periods of time, all learners' work must be collected and kept securely within the centre.

Learners are not permitted to use notes during task taking. Copies of the plays must be checked for notes/essay plans to prevent any incidents of malpractice Work may be handwritten or digitally produced. Learners are not permitted access to dictionaries or thesauri during task-taking, and digital grammar and spell check programmes must be disabled. Once the work is completed by the learner in this three-hour period, it may not be revised.

#### **Resources during task taking**

During the task taking stage, learners can have an unannotated copy of the Shakespeare play they have studied, but the use of other notes/resources is not allowed. This also prohibits the use of extracts from the play rather than a whole copy.

If learners bring their own computers or other electronic devices into supervised sessions, appropriate checks must be carried out to ensure that all materials stored on the devices are permissible and that access to the internet is disabled.

#### **Supervision during task taking**

The centre must ensure that:

- all candidates are within direct sight of the supervisor throughout the session(s)
- display materials which might provide assistance are removed or covered
- there is no access to e-mail, the internet or mobile phones
- candidates complete their work independently
- interaction with other candidates does not occur
- no assistance of any description is provided
- candidates' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be stored securely between timetabled sessions.

{7}------------------------------------------------

#### **Task B**

#### **Overview**

Task B is a paired discussion.

Centres must make an audio-visual recording of all paired discussions.

The total time learners are allowed to spend on research and planning is **2 hours**.

The total time learners are allowed to spend on the final assessment is **5-8 minutes**. 

Marks available: **30**

The task will be selected from a list prescribed by WJEC, which will offer two themes from the anthology as foci leading to a discussion of continuity and change in two or more poems from different periods. Paired learners should discuss the same poems.

The task and prescribed poem(s) will be released during the first week of April for assessment in the following academic year. The same task will remain for two years. Centres are required to ensure they use the correct task for each series. . Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the year learners undertake the task.

The discussion must be based on **one** 1600-1900 poem from the WJEC Anthology, and **one further** poem(s) chosen by the learner either from the anthology or a self-selected poem. Learner may include a third poem in the discussion if they wish.

The paired discussion will be linked to learners' appreciation of continuity and change in the content, context, ideas and attitudes, and/or language and style of the poems they have selected. Learners should engage with the unit concept and the designated theme, expressing personal opinions and feelings, and exploring similarities and differences over time. Their discussion should be supported by relevant examples, and they should use linguistic and literary approaches to communicate their ideas clearly. They do not, however, need to give a literary analysis of each poem.

Areas that could be considered include, but are not limited to:

- how poets across time express different attitudes to the designated themes
- how the chosen poems are linked by content, ideas or language/form
- how individual readers respond to each poet's experiences and attitudes
- how contextual factors shape meaning.

{8}------------------------------------------------

#### **Sample task**

#### **Theme: Relationships**

#### **How is love presented in the selected poems?**

Discussion to springboard from

- Prescribed 1600 1900 poem from the WJEC anthology: 'La Belle Dame sans Merci' (1820)
- Additional poem(s) is a choice made by the centre from the anthology or an additional poem

The NEA released in April 2026 will include an additional theme as a choice.

#### **Preparing for the Assessment – Research and planning**

Learners are allowed **2 hours** for the research and planning stage of this task. . This does not include time taken reading, studying and preparing poems with the learners.

While in the research and planning stage for this task, learners must work under indirect supervision. They may make use of research materials, and teachers may give advice of a general kind. The work of individual learners may be informed by working with their partner, but learners must then provide an individual oral response in the paired discussion.

Learners are not permitted to complete any of the research and planning work related to the NEA outside of the centre.

#### **Resources**

During the research and planning stage of this task:

- learners can have access to resources and/or preparatory notes. They should, however, be advised that all work must be their own – copying and pasting from internet sources, and/or reproducing someone else's work is plagiarism
- the use of AI to generate responses is prohibited and will be treated as malpractice
- learners' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be stored securely between timetabled sessions.

{9}------------------------------------------------

If learners bring their own computers or other electronic devices into supervised sessions, appropriate checks must be carried out to ensure that all materials stored on the devices are permissible.

If learners are provided with worksheets/scaffolding for their assessment, copies of the assistance they have been given must be included with the moderation sample. Such worksheets are not permitted as part of the notes for task-taking. Comments as to the nature and amount of help given should be made on the Unit 5 non-examination assessment coversheet. Candidate Mark Record Sheets for each series must be downloaded from the WJEC website.

#### **Supervision**

For the research and planning stage of this task, learners must be indirectly supervised:

The centre must ensure that:

- all candidates participate in the assessment
- there is sufficient supervision to ensure that work can be authenticated
- the work an individual candidate submits for assessment is their own.

#### **Task Taking – Oracy**

The paired discussion is expected to last between **5 and 8 minutes**. Contributions that significantly exceed or fall short of these times will be self-penalising.

To ensure fair assessment of all learners, teachers must intervene and draw the task to a close if the suggested time is exceeded. During the task, it is permissible to warn learners that their time is coming to an end.

Where it is seen to be appropriate, a teacher could take the role of partner for an individual candidate.

During the recorded oral response, the teacher may:

- stimulate discussion
- encourage a change of direction
- ask a learner to provide evidence to corroborate ideas or to develop an argument
- ensure that both candidates have the opportunity to engage in the discussion.

#### **Resources during task taking**

During the task taking stage, learners can have an annotated copy of the poems they have studied, and/or brief notes using bullet points (not full sentences). These should be collected at the end of the paired discussion and included with the moderation sample.

#### **Supervision during task taking**

For the task taking stage, learners must be directly supervised.

The centre must ensure that:

- all candidates are within direct sight of the supervisor throughout the session(s)
- display materials which might provide assistance are removed or covered
- there is no access to e-mail, the internet or mobile phones
- candidates complete their work independently
- no assistance of any description is provided

{10}------------------------------------------------

candidates' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be stored securely between timetabled sessions.

#### **Marking**

Both Task A and Task B will be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC. Teachers must use the assessment criteria provided by the WJEC . Relevant comments justifying the mark awarded should be completed on each unit coversheet.

The assessment of Task A (Shakespeare essay) must contain **both in-text annotations and a summative comment**. When assessing the final draft, it is important that only the candidate's own work is rewarded.

The assessment of Task B (paired discussion of poems) can be carried out either directly at the time of the response or by listening to the audio-visual recording at a later time. Teachers should make notes on the assessment including references to any teacher intervention – for example, to prompt a learner. This should be noted and taken into consideration when the assessment is made.

The work for this unit should be marked by teachers according to the marking criteria using a 'best fit' approach. Teachers select the band descriptors that most closely describe the quality of the work being marked.

Where the candidate's work convincingly meets the descriptors, the highest mark should be awarded.

Where the candidate's work adequately meets the descriptors, the mark in the middle range should be awarded where appropriate.

Where the candidate's work just meets the descriptors, the lowest mark should be awarded.

Marking should be positive, rewarding achievement rather than penalising failure or omissions. The award of marks must be directly related to the assessment criteria.

#### **Moderation**

Moderation will take place at two levels:

- within the centre to ensure that a uniform standard has been applied across teaching groups – this must be done in good time so that marks and samples can be submitted for the WJEC deadline through moderation of a sample of work by WJEC
- through moderation of a sample of work by WJEC.

All learners are required to sign an authentication form to confirm that the work submitted is their own. Teachers are required to confirm that the work assessed is solely that of the learner concerned and was conducted under the required conditions.

A copy of the authentication form, which forms part of the cover sheet for each learner's work, must be downloaded from the WJEC website.

Malpractice discovered prior to the learner signing the declaration of authentication need not be reported to WJEC but must be dealt with in accordance with the centre's internal procedures.

{11}------------------------------------------------

#### **Teacher Guidance**

The level of guidance teachers may give throughout the assessment of this unit are as follows:

| Review candidates' work and provide oral and written advice at a general level in order to secure a functional outcome. |  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| Evaluate progress to date and propose broad approaches for improvement.                                                     |  |
| Provide detailed specific advice on how to improve drafts to meet assessment criteria. | x |
| Give detailed feedback on errors and omissions which leave candidates with no opportunity to show initiative themselves. | x |
| Intervene personally to improve the presentation or content of work.                                                        | x |

N.B. In all levels of guidance, teachers are permitted to intervene/advise on issues of safety or wellbeing.

#### **Collaboration during the tasks**

For Task A, collaboration is partially permitted. Learners are not permitted to work in groups but are permitted to comment on each other's work in controlled conditions, for example as part of teacher-sanctioned peer feedback.

All work produced must be the learner's own.

For Task B, collaboration is partially permitted. During the preparation for the discussion, learners are permitted to work in pairs. However:

- each learner must annotate their own poems and write up their own notes. It is acceptable for both learners to use the same research, but each learner must use their own words to present their ideas and draw their own conclusions
- the preparation time should not be used to rehearse the discussion.

The work of each learner in the paired discussion must be individually assessed and therefore will not necessarily receive the same mark. The teacher's record must describe individual learner's contributions.

You should refer to the Assessment Guide / JCQ Instructions for conducting nonexamination assessment for further information on managing assessment within our GCSE Qualifications.

## WJEC English Language and Literature

<span id="page-22-0"></span>Sample Candidate Assessment Pack (3750U5)

Unit 5: Continuity and Change

{23}------------------------------------------------

#### About this pack: information and instructions for candidates

This candidate assessment pack is for candidates completing Unit 5 – Continuity and Change.

Within this pack, you will find:

- information for candidates, which tells you about things that you must and must not do when you are completing the assessment
- the mark scheme which will be used to assess your work
- a Declaration Form
- a Time Record sheet.

#### **Task A: You will have 6 hours in total to complete this assessment.** You should spend approximately:

- 3 hours completing research and planning
- 3 hours completing the final assessment

#### **Task B: You will have just over 2 hours in total to complete this assessment.** You should spend approximately:

- 2 hour/s completing task research and planning
- 5-8 minutes completing the final assessment

You will be supervised throughout the assessment.

Your teacher is allowed to help you to understand the assessment tasks, but there are rules about the kind of help and how much they can give you. You should speak to your teacher if you have any questions about what you are and are not allowed to do as you are completing the tasks, as they will know how much help they are allowed to give you.

It is important that you work independently from other candidates and the work produced should be your own unaided work. You and your teacher will be required to sign a declaration that all work presented is your own work.

You are advised to check your work carefully to make sure that it is accurate and correct.

**You must not discuss or share any details of the brief until after 5 May 202X.**

{24}------------------------------------------------

### Information for candidates

The following information has been taken from the [JCQ Information for candidates –](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) non[examination assessments](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) and the [JCQ Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) Use in Assessments:](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/)  [Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/) This tells you about things that you **must** and **must not** do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not understand, you **must** ask your teacher.

## **Preparing your work**

- When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you need to ensure that your final product reflects your own independent work and isn't copied or paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
- If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you **must** tell your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
- If you worked as part of a group on a task, you **must** each write up your own account of the assignment. Even if the data you have is the same, you **must** describe in your own words how that data was obtained, and you **must** independently draw your own conclusions from the data.
- Take care of your work and keep it safe. **Do not** leave it lying around where your classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You **must** always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; **do not** share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
- **Do not** be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI tools and chatbots) – this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort of copying.
- You **must not** write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

## **Plagiarism**

Plagiarism involves taking someone else's words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them off as your own. **It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously.** Don't think you won't be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:

- Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
- Markers are highly experienced subject specialists they may have read the source you are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!
- Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and style of writing or punctuation.

## **Penalties for breaking the regulations**

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be applied:

- the piece of work will be awarded zero marks
- you will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question
- you will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series
- you will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

**Remember – it's your qualification so it needs to be your own work**
