#### **Unit 6 – Accompanying Texts**

#### **Text A –**

is non-continuous text produced by YouGov, a company that surveys public opinion and provides data. This text presents data gathered about the outdated terms 'BAME' and 'Minority Ethnic'.

### **How do ethnic minority Britons feel about the term 'BAME'?**

#### **What does BAME mean?**

The vast majority of ethnic minority Britons (83%) say they understand the term BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) very or fairly well, whilst 13% say they lack understanding. This uncertainty increases with age; 8% of those aged 18 to 24 have this view compared to 19% of those aged 65 and above.

Slightly more ethnic minority Britons say that they don't understand what is meant by the term 'Minority Ethnic' (17%). The youngest age group say they don't understand it, 23% of those aged 18 to 24; compared to 14% of 50-64 year olds and 15% of those aged 65 and above.

{21}------------------------------------------------

#### **Is it acceptable to use the term BAME?**

Attitudes here appear contradictory. While ethnic minority Britons tend to think it is acceptable to use as an umbrella term for the portion of the British population that is non-white (by 49% to 31%), it is not their preferred term, which goes to simply "ethnic minorities" by 58% to 27%.

![](_page_21_Figure_4.jpeg)

The tendency to see BAME as an oversimplification is clear across all ethnic groups. All ethnic groups tend to see the term as a short-term fix.

**Text C** – This text is taken from his novel written by Sathnam Sangehera, *The Boy with the Topknot* (a topknot is a hair bun often worn by Sikhs). In this text he shares some of his secondary school experiences where he is just one of a few non-white children.

Things were going badly for me at my new school, and had been from the moment I went to buy the uniform from Beatties department store in town and Mum asked me to haggle down the price, only for the assistant to retort: 'This isn't Wolverhampton market, madam.' Into my second year, I still felt bewildered by the school: the way the music teacher gave us a keyboard and just expected us to be able to read and write music; the way some of the kids patted the corners of their mouths at the end of their packed lunch; the way, frankly, they were so white. Until I went to Wolverhampton Grammar, I hadn't really been aware of being different. Largely because, even with my topknot, I wasn't. In my final class at Woden Primary, there were two of us (boys) in my class alone with long hair and, if anything, my classmates found my name – translating as 'god', and bearing an admittedly hilarious likeness to 'Batman' ('Satman!) – more amusing than my hair. But now I was just one of a few topknots in the whole school, and my days were marked by taunts of 'Oi turbinator' and 'Is that your packed lunch on your head?'

In this new environment, I felt I could do nothing right. When we were asked to wrap our textbooks for protection, I did so in 1970s floral wallpaper, while the boys around me came back with theirs expertly wrapped in plastic. While the other kids who had packed lunches came with neatly packed sandwiches, Mum gave me omelette sandwiches and aloo gobi parathas, which stank out the packed lunch area, so much so that I ate alone outside. After several months I had managed to make only one proper friend – James Lockley, or Lock, as we called each other by surnames, who caught the bus to school from a similarly crap part of town and shared my pop music obsession.

From wanting to be centre of attention, I became timid and speechless. At junior school, parents' evenings had been the absolute highlight of my year, as exciting as a birthday and Christmas combined. I would whip myself into a state of high excitement as mum disappeared down the road with my sister Puli – who went to translate – and almost shake with pleasure as mum returned to repeat every comment with a smile and a congratulatory 'Shabaash'. But now I couldn't stand them.

#### MARK SCHEME

#### **Guidance for examiners**

#### <span id="page-24-0"></span>**Generic marking principles**

- Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
- Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.
- Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
- Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

#### **Positive marking**

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising candidates for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates' answers. The list is not exhaustive. The inclusion of *'Credit any other valid response.*' (or similar instruction) within mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates' responses. Credit should be given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates' answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However, unless there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks where the answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

#### **Banded mark schemes**

For band marked questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in candidates' answers. It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate's response. As noted above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive and candidates do not have to include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been provided, no marks should be awarded.

{25}------------------------------------------------

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each candidate's response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills, knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors or omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate's answer to pick out the evidence that is being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied. This is done as a two-stage process.

#### **Stage 1 – Deciding on the band**

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate's answer and check whether it matches the descriptors for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the descriptors most closely matches the work.

#### **Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark**

Having determined the appropriate band, deciding on the mark within a band will be made on the basis of a 'best fit' procedure, weaknesses in some areas being compensated for by strengths in others.

Examiners should use the full range of marks available to them. Marking should be positive, rewarding achievement rather that penalising failure or omissions. The awarding of marks must be directly related to the marking criteria, and all responses must be marked according to the banded levels provided for each question.

Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be provided during standardising and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work. Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the standardising material as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the work submitted.

This mark scheme instructs examiners to look for and reward valid alternatives where indicative content is suggested for an answer. This is not a checklist for expected content in an answer, or set out as a 'model answer', as responses must be marked in the banded levels of response provided for each question. Where a candidate provides a response that contains aspects or approaches not included in the indicative content, examiners should use their professional judgement to determine the validity of the response in light of the task and reward as directed by the bands. Candidates are free to choose any approach that is relevant to the set task. Candidates can (and will most likely) incorporate ideas other than those mentioned in the mark scheme.

#### **Points that candidates may consider:**

- he was not taught about the contributions of people of colour to British wartime efforts "No one ever taught me that at school", the scale of which is emphasised to shock the audience "over a million"
- "we never learned about the British Empire" shows this subject was not something commonly taught / the plight of indigenous people were whitewashed in history teaching
- repeated use of plural pronoun "we" to highlight that the lack of knowledge about this is widespread / including the audience in the shame of not knowing this history
- repetition of "we never learned" to emphasise the profound effect of narrow education
- use of hypothetical sentence, "If we did learn about that then maybe we wouldn't think about diversity … of politeness", to show what could be achieved if these subjects had been taught / looks at education from a different angle helps us consider how things could have been different/positive
- passive voice "no-one ever taught me that" to stress gaps in education when he was young
- use of metaphor "we never learned about whose blood…" gives a stark image of the history that hasn't been shared – especially relating to diversity; audience will question their own education
- "maybe we'd think" gives the impression that a lack of education when young has lifelong repercussions
- "It was only recently I learned…" gives the impression of a continuing education
- active voice "I learned…" to show that he is now in control of what he learns (subjects that he is interested in)
- use of timed pauses throughout the extract to allow the audience to register the significance of what Ahmed is saying.

Look for and reward valid alternatives.

| 8. | In line 2, the writer tells us that his mother asked him to "haggle" down the price of his school uniform. Which of the following best describes the meaning of "haggle". Tick (✓) one box. |  | [1] |  | [1] |
|  | to find an alternative school uniform to pay for the school uniform using shopping vouchers |  |  |  |  |
|  | to try and agree a lower price for the school uniform ✓ |  |  |  |  |

| Question |  | Answer | AO1 | AO2 | Total Mark |
| 9. |  | Using linguistic and literary approaches, explore how the writer of Text C presents his school experience as difficult. | 10 | 3 | 13 |

#### **Points that candidates may consider:**

- direct (declarative) statement "things were going badly for me at school"; the reader is left in no doubt
- even buying the uniform was a source of cultural embarrassment when his mum asked him to "haggle the price…"
- uses the adjective "bewildered" to suggest his unease with and confusion about school
- his teachers' expectations were high "just expected to be able to read and write music" which makes him feel substandard
- he feels alienated by the manners of some other pupils who "patted the corners of their mouths at the end of their packed lunch"
- he highlights the stark cultural differences between different ethnicities with the adverb *so* "they were so white"
- he is made to feel "different"
- racial slurs are pervasive and wide-ranging, from comments about his "topknot" to more abusive challenge "Oi turbinator"
- he feels personally incapable "I could do nothing right"
- he lists points of contrast to emphasis the differences between himself and the other boys: "floral wallpaper" and "expertly wrapped in plastic" / "neatly packed sandwiches" and "aloo gobi parathas" suggests acute consciousness of differences between social and ethnic groups
- "one proper friend" isolated from the others/quite lonely in school
- his one friend came from "a similarly crap part of town": more affluent children did not socialise with him
- the effects on being so miserable at school left him "timid and speechless"
- the change from the excitement of parents' evenings to now feeling "I couldn't stand them" suggests a disenfranchisement from his education / a lack of pride or self-worth.

Look for and reward valid alternatives.

| Points of similarity / difference | TEXT B | TEXT C |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inclusion | First and foremost, we are all human beings "what unites us is far, far greater than what divides us" | Pride taken in education in primary school "parents' evenings had been the absolute highlight of my year" |
| Cultural value | British music industry is representative and produces "world-conquering musical genres" | He sees his culture as separating him from students who eat "neatly packed sandwiches" whilst he has "aloo gobi parathas" for lunch |
| Division / Isolation | If individuals do not feel included in British society we run the risk of "losing people to extremism" | Sense of isolation in school as the vast majority of students were "so white" |
| Historic / Identity | People of colour have contributed to British society for hundreds, if not thousands, of years – often unrecognised "Over a million Indians fought and died for Great Britain" | his sister "went to translate" at parents' evenings indicating the value his parents placed on retaining their language and cultural identity |
| Social views | Inclusion and representing multicultural Britain is morally right: "Let's do what's right" | He is socially limited to people from "a similarly crap part of town" |
| Effects of under representation | If people of colour aren't represented "they'll switch off" from mainstream society | He feels a changed person "In this new environment, I felt I could do nothing right" and becomes "timid and speechless" |
| Representation / Visibility | White population of Britain are represented in "billboard[s], TV, film" whereas people of colour are not. | He is viewed as other/different and assigned an identity based on his racial appearance "I was just one of a few topknots" |
| Diversity | The importance of showing people "characters and stories that don't resemble them at all" to foster tolerance and understanding | In his primary school he "hadn't really been aware of being different" as there was greater diversity in the cultural and racial backgrounds of pupils |
| Education | Education excludes historically problematic events "we never learned about the British Empire" | He is marginalised at school "I ate alone outside" |

{33}------------------------------------------------

#### Overview:

Text B – aware of problems but hopeful for the future. Encourages people to make a difference and change. See the dangers of not embracing different cultures.

Text C – acutely aware of cultural differences. Shows how people can really struggle to fit in – culture can make people feel isolated.

Look for and reward valid comparisons.
