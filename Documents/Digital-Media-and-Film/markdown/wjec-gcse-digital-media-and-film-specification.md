## GCSE DIGITAL MEDIA AND FILM

## 1 INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Aims

GCSE Digital Media and Film supports learners to:

- explore and appreciate other people's digital media and film products to develop their own digital media and/or film talents
- develop knowledge, appreciation and understanding of the uses and impact of digital media and film and of how meaning is communicated
- gain an understanding of genres and contexts of digital media and film
- respond to and reflect on digital media and film created by other people, applying knowledge of contexts to evaluate the effectiveness of ideas and techniques used to communicate meaning
- develop creative skills through experimenting and investigating to plan, design and produce effective digital media and/or film products
- apply technical skills to demonstrate control
- reflect on, refine and evaluate their own work
- enable learners to explore the cross-cutting themes of human rights and diversity, including Black, Asian and minority ethnic themes, contributions and experiences.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales' s Approval Criteria.

## 1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Digital Media and Film qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the principles of progression, along with the statements of what matters and those subject specific skills and concepts outlined in the ' Designing your Curriculum ' section of the Expressive Arts Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted on page 24; the Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.



{8}------------------------------------------------



The GCSE Digital Media and Film qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:

- Supporting the statements of what matters by giving learners the opportunity to:
- engage with genres, techniques, tools, materials and practices that enables them to become curious and creative individuals
- develop an understanding of how the expressive arts communicate through visual, physical, verbal, musical and technological means
- develop their imagination and draw upon their own experiences, skills and talents to become creative artists themselves
- explore work from diverse cultures and societies and learn about these influences, histories and impact
- consider creative work in a range of digital media, forms, genres and styles
- learn the important skills of refinement and analysis
- reflect on the effectiveness of their own work and that of others, including the work of diverse artists from Wales and beyond
- be innovative and bold, and to create individual work
- communicate through a variety of digital media forms.
- Supporting the principles of progression 1  by encouraging learners to:
- explore, experience, interpret, create and respond to increasingly complex meaning
- develop an increased sophistication of conceptual learning
- develop a more sophisticated use of relevant skills and the ability to transfer existing skills and knowledge into new context.
- Supporting the subject specific considerations for Digital Media and Film 2  by giving learners the opportunity to consider:
- Aspects of pre-production, production and post-production, including editing, cinematography; sound, production design (including mise-en-scène), narrative, style, genre.
- Products and forms: film, television, audio (podcasting and digital radio), video games, websites.
- Distribution and exhibition: online platforms (including social media and streaming sites), cinema, digital television, video gaming platforms.
- Producers and audience s, including users, 'prosumers', spectators, content creators.
- Messages, ethics and issues: representations of people, identities, places and society, digital divides, social media issues (including privacy, bias and misinformation).

## 1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 -14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of Media or Film at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

{9}------------------------------------------------



## 1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE Digital Media and Film has been designed to be delivered within 120 -140 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

## 1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

## 1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

## 2 SUBJECT CONTENT

## How to read the amplification

The amplification provided in the right-hand column , titled 'Further Information' uses the following four stems:

- 'Learners should be aware of' is used when learners do not need to understand all aspects of the specified content in detail. Teachers should refer to Guidance for Teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and breadth to which this content should be taught.
- 'Learners should know' is used when learners are required to demonstrate basic knowledge and understanding.
- 'Learners should understand' is used when learners are required to demonstrate greater depth of knowledge and understanding, application of knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and analysis and evaluation of information for a given purpose.
- 'Learners should be able to' is used when learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques.

The use of the word ' including ' indicates that the specified content must be taught and could be subject to assessment.

The use of the words 'for example' or 'such as' indicates that the specified content is for guidance only, and alternative examples could be chosen.

## Opportunities for integration of learning experiences

GCSE Digital Media and Film generates opportunities for the following learning experiences to be developed (experiences will not be directly assessed):

- opportunities to undertake professional film and digital media experiences, such as studio visits, visiting professionals, or masterclasses - either in person or on-screen
- confidence in giving and receiving feedback, promoting independent thinking, originality and creative resilience
- opportunities to investigate, take risks and overcome creative challenges
- experience some form of collaborative work.

The Guidance for Teaching will include further information on the opportunities provided by the qualification for teachers/centres to integrate these learning experiences and skills into delivery.

For opportunities to develop cross-cutting themes, cross-curricular skills and integral skills please see Appendix A.

## 3.2 Arrangements for non-examination assessment

## Unit 2: Overview

For this assessment learners are required to build a portfolio by conducting independent research and producing a case study exploring the success of two products produced by a company in Wales. Learners should assess how the genre codes and conventions of the products appeal to audiences, examine the processes involved in production and the strategies for distribution and exhibition. Learners are then required to create a distribution strategy and an exhibition strategy for a new Welsh production company. There are two tasks for learners to complete:

1. Consider two digital media and/or film products produced by a company based in Wales and evaluate their success. Examine how the products use genre codes and conventions, how the products are produced and the strategies for distribution and exhibition.
2. You have been commissioned to propose a distribution strategy and an exhibition strategy for a new media product produced by a production company based in Wales. Decide on one product that you feel could be produced by your production company and then plan how it will be distributed and exhibited.

Learners may complete the assessment anytime during the course. However, centres should ensure that assessment is completed only when learners have undertaken the necessary teaching and learning and developed the required skills and knowledge.

The assessment contributes to 30% of the overall qualification. The unit will be marked out of a total of 72 marks.

The unit has a recommended teaching time of 36 hours which should incorporate teaching and learning and completing the assessment. Learners will have 18 hours to complete the assessment.

The assessment will be stored on the WJEC Portal.

This unit will be assessed by the centre and externally moderated by WJEC.

## Unit 3: Overview

For this assessment learners are required to:

1.   Produce two production pieces from the selected brief. One production piece should be audio-visual/audio and the other should be digital/online.
2.   Produce a reflective log.

## Stimulus

Learners will choose one brief from a list of three supplied on a three-year basis by WJEC. The brief will always be for a marketing campaign for a new:

- film
- video game
- series for a streaming site.

Every three years the following will change:

- the target audience
- the list of genres.



{28}------------------------------------------------



The assessment contributes to 40% of the overall qualification. The unit will be marked out of a total of 96 marks.

This unit has a recommended teaching time of 48 hours which should incorporate exploring, teaching and learning, creating and reflecting. There is no restriction on the amount of time candidates spend on the assessment.

The stimuli will be released on the WJEC Portal during the September of the first year of study, and new stimuli will be supplied every three years.

This unit will be assessed by the centre and externally moderated by WJEC.



{29}------------------------------------------------



## 4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for GCSE Digital Media and Film.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our Guide to preventing, reporting and investigating malpractice.

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC (malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet Suspected Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.



{30}------------------------------------------------



## 5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

## 5.1 Making entries

This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the course. Non-examination assessed units can be completed earlier in the course but must be submitted at the end of the course.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series until the end of the life of this specification. Summer 2028 will be the first assessment opportunity.

A qualification may be taken more than once.

Learners who resit the examination unit can carry forward the marks they received for non-examination assessment units from the first time they attempted the qualification.

Marks for non-examination assessment (NEA) may be carried forward for the life of the specification. If a candidate resits an NEA unit (rather than carrying forward the previous NEA mark), it is the new mark that will count towards the overall grade, even if it is lower than a previous attempt (unless the mark is absent).

The entry codes appear below.

|                                  | Entry code     | Entry code   |

## Appendix B: Glossary of Terminology

The following is a glossary of terminology which is designed to assist centres in preparing learners for the examined assessment within Unit 1 and the non-examined assessment within Units 2 and 3.

They are not aligned to specific assessment criteria within individual units but are designed to aid learners in articulating their ideas using subject-specific terminology as well as offering a range of concepts, terms and ideas for content that learners might wish to consider and/or include in the exploration and preparation of their practical and theoretical work. This list isn't exhaustive and centres/learners may explore other appropriate techniques and/or conventions.

| Genre                         | The type or category of a media product. In relation to film , a genre is a category or classification that identifies films based on their narrative elements, themes, tone, setting and stylistic approach. It helps audiences set expectations about the kind of story and emotional experience a film will deliver. In relation to video games , a genre is a classification that groups games based on their gameplay mechanics, objectives and player interactions, rather than just narrative or setting (as in film). It helps define how a game is played, what skills are required, and what kind of experience the player can expect. |
