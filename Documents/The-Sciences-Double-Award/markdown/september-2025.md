Following a consultation under the guidance of Canolfan Bedwyr, which is Bangor University's Centre for Welsh Language Services, Research and Technology (who are responsible for Y Termiadur Addysg), a decision was made to change the Welsh language terminology currently in use for 'speed' and 'velocity'.

{2}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_2_Picture_0.jpeg)

An important point to make here is that Canolfan Bedwyr consulted with WJEC, mathematics and physics subject specialists, the national literacy tests specialist panel and teachers who currently teach these subjects in secondary schools.

# The problem

The central issue with the current terminology is the inconsistency which exists between:

- Language in common, everyday use:
  - The word 'cyflymder' is used for 'speed' outside school including in professional situations (such as any discussion relating to speed limits etc). 'Buanedd' is an old historical term which doesn't form part of everyday language.
- Primary education:
  - Pupils learn the term 'cyflymder' for 'speed' in primary school.
- Secondary education:
  - When they reach secondary school, pupils need to change to using 'buanedd' for 'speed' without understanding why that is. Years later, the use of 'cyflymder' for 'velocity' is introduced.
- Educational subjects:
  - 'Cyflymder' is used for 'speed' in subjects like Physical Education and Information Technology but then 'cyflymder' is also used for 'velocity' in the subjects of Physics and Mathematics.

This inconsistency confuses pupils, especially as they move from primary to secondary education or in resources or activities which encompass both periods. The recent national numeracy tests are such an example, where a decision has to be made as to which term to use, with these tests being given to primary and secondary pupils. This problem will continue despite the fact that changes will be coming to these tests over the next few years.

#### The change

- **•** To use 'cyflymder' for 'speed' across all levels of education (reconciling with common speech)
- **•** Coin the new term 'felosedd' for 'velocity'
- **•** Dispose of the term 'buanedd' as a technical term

#### Arguments for change

- **•** It would reconcile terminology across primary and secondary education
- **•** It would reconcile school terminology with common speech
- **•** It would follow modern terminology principles (that is keeping familiar words for familiar concepts)

# Implementing the change

#### New GCSE/Level 2 specifications (teaching from 2025/2026)

Based on the recommendations of Canolfan Bedwyr therefore, 'cyflymder' (speed) and 'felosedd' (velocity) will be used in the following new qualifications:

- GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy (double award) specification teaching from 2025
- Level 2 Additional Mathematics specification teaching from 2026
- GCSE The Sciences (double award) teaching from 2026
- GCSE Integrated Science teaching from 2026

In order to mitigate for any confusion which may be caused by this change, the English terms will be put in brackets the first time the terms appear in an examination paper.

#### Current GCSE/Level 2 specifications

## Please note: these changes relate to the new specifications only, there will be NO change to the terms used in the current specifications.

'Buanedd' (speed) and 'cyflymder' (velocity) will continue to be used in the following specifications:

- GCSE Mathematics/Numeracy specification (current)
- Level 2 Additional Mathematics specification (current)
- GCSE Science specifications (Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Science Double Award, Applied Science Single Award/Double Award) (current)

From 2026 onwards, the terms in English will also be placed in brackets in the examination papers of the above specifications. This is to avoid any confusion for the candidates sitting one of the current GCSE Science specifications and the new GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy specification (teaching from 2025).
