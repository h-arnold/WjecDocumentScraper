# GCSE THE SCIENCES (DOUBLE AWARD)

# <span id="page-6-0"></span>1 INTRODUCTION

## <span id="page-6-1"></span>1.1 Aims

GCSE The Sciences (Double Award) supports learners to:

- demonstrate knowledge and understanding from a range of sciences, including biology, chemistry, and physics
- understand how different areas of science relate to them personally, locally, nationally, and internationally
- explore the connections between different topics of learning within and between each discipline
- develop the skills to question scientific ideas, using critical and creative thinking to solve problems
- develop a variety of enquiry skills, enabling them to successfully refine ways of working
- understand relationships between data, evidence and conclusions through quantitative and qualitative analysis and research
- understand and evaluate scientific models
- understand, evaluate and challenge scientific methods, evidence, and conclusions
- apply mathematical, communication and digital skills and tools when developing scientific knowledge and skills
- appreciate the role played by morals, ethics, sustainability, and other aspects of decision-making in the application of science.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales' Approval Criteria.

## <span id="page-6-2"></span>1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE The Sciences (Double Award) qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of what matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/statements-of-what-matters/) and those [subject specific skills and concepts](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area) outlined in the '[Designing your Curriculum](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/designing-your-curriculum/)' section of the Science and Technology Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted on page 65; the Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery. 

{8}------------------------------------------------

The GCSE The Sciences (Double Award) qualification will support the Curriculum for Wales by:

- supporting the statements of what matters, giving learners the opportunity to engage with the following:
  - curiosity being curious and searching for answers is essential to understanding and predicting phenomena
  - living things the world around us is full of living things which depend on each other for survival
  - matter matter and the way it behaves defines our universe and shapes our lives
  - forces forces and energy provide a foundation for understanding our universe.
- supporting the principles of progression by:
  - developing knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts
  - using, applying and evaluating scientific enquiry skills
  - becoming more effective as a learner, to solve scientific problems with increased independence
  - making connections and exploring new contexts, considering the impacts of scientific actions.

The construct of GCSE The Sciences (Double Award) qualification is to:

- explain phenomena scientifically to demonstrate how the world works
- construct and evaluate designs for scientific enquiry and interpret scientific data and evidence critically
- research, evaluate and use scientific information to make informed decisions[1](#page-7-2) .

## <span id="page-7-0"></span>1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of Biology, Chemistry and/or Physics at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

# <span id="page-7-1"></span>1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE The Sciences (Double Award) has been designed to be delivered within 240 – 280 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

## <span id="page-8-0"></span>1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

## <span id="page-8-1"></span>1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications.

# <span id="page-9-0"></span>2 SUBJECT CONTENT

The subject content for GCSE The Sciences qualification empowers learners by helping them understand how various areas of science connect to their lives on personal, local, national and global levels. Through exploring real-world scientific issues and phenomena, learners gain insight into how science impacts their everyday experiences and the world around them. The specification content encourages the development of creative thinking and problem-solving skills, allowing learners to approach challenges with innovation and logic. It also offers valuable opportunities for independent research, fostering curiosity and analytical thinking. Additionally, learners are encouraged to apply digital skills and tools throughout their studies, preparing them for a modern, technology-driven world.

## <span id="page-9-1"></span>Scientific Enquiry Skills

Scientific enquiry is fundamental to this qualification.

Scientific enquiry is the broad process of asking questions, exploring ideas and seeking understanding about natural phenomena. It involves practical and investigation skills alongside curiosity-driven activities like questioning, observing, gathering information and thinking critically. Scientific enquiry can include everything from formulating research questions to designing and carrying out experiments.

Investigation is part of scientific enquiry; it refers to the process of collecting data to answer a particular scientific question. An investigation is typically a planned, structured activity where experiments are conducted, observations are made or measurements are taken, to test a hypothesis or explore a problem. It also includes evaluation, consideration of next steps and planning of further work. Within the subject content there are a number of examples where 'investigate' is used. This is to ensure that specific investigation skills are developed

Scientific enquiry should not be treated as a standalone activity limited to Unit 7 but fully embedded throughout the teaching and learning of all units, ensuring that learners develop these important skills continuously and in context. This includes conducting practical science experiments and enquiries that actively engage learners, bringing their learning to life and fostering curiosity.

Every unit provides opportunities to enhance scientific enquiry skills, and it is essential that teaching and learning incorporates these experiences in a structured and meaningful way.

Scientific enquiry skills will be assessed in all units.

Further guidance to support the teaching and learning of these scientific enquiry skills can be found in the Scientific Enquiry Framework (Appendix B) and the Guidance for Teaching document.

## <span id="page-10-0"></span>Mathematical Skills

Additionally, mathematical skills play a crucial role in scientific understanding and must be integrated into the teaching of subject content rather than taught in isolation. Teaching and learning planning should ensure that learners apply relevant mathematical skills throughout their scientific studies, as outlined in Appendix D.

## <span id="page-11-0"></span>How to read the amplification

The amplification provided in the right-hand column uses the following four stems:

- 'Learners should know' is used when learners are required to demonstrate basic knowledge and understanding.
- 'Learners should understand' is used when learners are required to demonstrate greater depth of knowledge and understanding, application of knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and analysis and evaluation of information for a given purpose.
- 'Learners should be able to' is used when learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application of scientific enquiry skills.
- 'Learners should be aware of' is used when learners do not need to understand all aspects of the specified content in detail. This statement is used to set the content into a context. Teachers should refer to Guidance for Teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and breadth to which this content should be taught.

The use of the word 'including' indicates that the specified content must be taught and could be subject to assessment.

The use of the words 'for example' or 'such as' indicates that the specified content is for guidance only, and alternative examples could be chosen.

The layout of the content in the amplification will also support teachers' understanding of depth. If content within an amplification statement is for straightforward knowledge recall, such as naming something, then no sub-bullet is used. For example:

- the structure of a leaf, including cuticle, epidermis, stomata, guard cells, palisade layer, spongy layer, xylem and phloem.

If sub bullets are used, this indicates that the content given must be further developed. For example:

#### Content in **bold:**

This content is higher tier content only.

{13}------------------------------------------------

## <span id="page-12-0"></span>Connections and relationships between topics within scientific disciplines

This content enables learners to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the relationships and connections between different topics within that discipline. This content is identified by using *italics* in the first unit of each discipline (Units 1, 2 and 3) and then referenced at the start of each section in the second unit of each discipline (Units 4, 5 and 6).

This content has been selected to provide meaningful opportunities for learners to build upon the scientific knowledge, understanding and skills introduced in Units 1, 2, and 3. The aim is to create a natural progression that strengthens foundational concepts and deepens learners' engagement with the subject content and scientific enquiry.

## <span id="page-64-0"></span>Unit 7 Scientific Enquiry

Learners are required to complete two enquiries from a choice of three*.* Each chosen enquiry includes a practical task and written task 10% of qualification 56 marks

This assessment will not be tiered

#### **Overview of unit**

Scientific Enquiry is an integral element of the qualification. It encourages both scientific curiosity, and practical work, which helps to engage learners. It and helps them to develop a deeper understanding of the sciences.

The purpose of this unit is to:

- develop scientific thinking
- use experimental skills and strategies
- undertake practical science experiments as part of a scientific enquiry
- enquire into and apply scientific enquiry skills relevant to the context of the enquiry.

## **Areas of content**

This unit is based on the content and skills developed across the qualification and will give learners the opportunity to demonstrate their scientific enquiry skills from page 10 of the specification. These skills are further outlined in the Scientific Enquiry Framework (Appendix B). Learners should also demonstrate their use of scientific terminology (Appendix C) and mathematical skills (Appendix D).

The assessment requires candidates to undertake two scientific enquiries. Centres will be given three enquiries to choose from. Each enquiry is based on one of the science disciplines. The tasks within the enquires will be set in engaging contexts.

Each enquiry consists of two tasks.

#### Task 1 (6 marks):

Learners may work in groups of no more than three. Learners will be required to carry out a practical investigation using a given method including observation, measurement, and the collection of reliable data through hands-on experimentation.

#### Task 2 (22 marks):

Learners must work independently in high controlled conditions. Learners will be required to use the Scientific Enquiry Skills they have developed across the qualification. They should have access to their completed Task A.

Both tasks are designed to assess skills the Scientific Enquiry Skills listed on page 10 of this specification.

{66}------------------------------------------------

## <span id="page-65-0"></span>Opportunities for integration of learning experiences

GCSE The Science (Double Award) generates opportunities for the following learning experiences to be developed (experiences will not be directly assessed):

- explore relationships and connections between the sciences
- engage with the work of diverse scientists or professionals working in related areas, either in person or on-screen and/or remotely, to understand their interests and experiences within the sector
- visit areas of scientific interest, which could include natural environments, constructed environments, other educational establishments with a scientific focus, or scientific facilities. This could be either in person or digitally
- engage in learning outside of the classroom to further develop scientific understanding and skills
- research the different roles and careers that draw upon science
- develop collaboration skills by working with, and learning from, others.

The Guidance for Teaching will include further information on the opportunities provided by the qualification for teachers/centres to integrate these learning experiences and skills into delivery.

For opportunities to develop cross-cutting themes, cross-curricular skills and integral skills please see Appendix A.

# <span id="page-67-0"></span>4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for GCSE The Sciences.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our [Guide to preventing, reporting and](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)  [investigating malpractice.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC (malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet [Suspected](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)  [Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)

# <span id="page-68-0"></span>5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

## <span id="page-68-1"></span>5.1 Entries and Awards

This is a unitised qualification. Learners are entered for each unit separately.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer assessment period each year, until the end of the life of the specification.

Unit 1, Unit 2 and Unit 3 will be available in 2026 (and each year thereafter). Unit 4, Unit 5 and Unit 6 will be available in 2027 (and each year thereafter) and the qualification will be awarded for the first time in summer 2028.

Unit 7 will be available in the spring term from 2028 and each spring term thereafter. Centres should choose two out of the three enquires.

### Pre-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or under on 31st August in the academic year in which they were entered)

The terminal rule is set at 55% of the overall qualification for Pre-16 Candidates for GCSE The Sciences (Double Award).

If the assessment being re-taken contributes to the 55% terminal rule requirement, the mark for the new assessment will count regardless of previous results in that assessment.

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade subject to the terminal rule being satisfied first i.e. that candidates must complete 55% of the assessment for a qualification in the series in which they are cashing in.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s). This is referred to as a 'fresh start'. When retaking a qualification (fresh start), a candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from examination units taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating the new grade(s).

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

### Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1st September in the academic year in which they are entered)

There is no terminal rule that applies to Post-16 Candidates for GCSE The Sciences (Double Award).

There is no limit on the number of times a candidate can resit an individual unit; however, the better uniform mark score from the most two recent attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade.

The 'fresh start' rule does not apply to post-16 candidates.

{70}------------------------------------------------

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

## <span id="page-69-0"></span>5.2 Grading, awarding and reporting

<span id="page-69-1"></span>GCSE double award qualifications are reported on an eight point scale from A\*A\*- GG, where A\*A\* is the highest grade. Results not attaining the minimum standard for the award will be reported as U (unclassified).

{71}------------------------------------------------

## 5.3 Tiering

There are two tiers of entry for each unit of qualification.

Higher Tier: A\*– D Foundation Tier: C – G

Learners may be entered at different tiers across units.

The raw marks gained in each of the seven units will be converted to give a learner a Uniform Marks Scale (UMS) mark for each unit. The maximum UMS available for each assessment will be in line with the grades available for the tier taken in each assessment. These will then be aggregated to give a final UMS mark, providing a learner's overall grade in this qualification.

Individual unit results are reported on a uniform mark scale (UMS) with the following grade equivalences:

|        | Max<br>raw<br>marks | Max<br>UMS. | A* | A  | B  | C  | D  | E  | F  | G  |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Unit 1 | 56                  | 100         | 90 | 80 | 70 | 60 | 50 | 40 | 30 | 20 |
| Unit 2 | 56                  | 100         | 90 | 80 | 70 | 60 | 50 | 40 | 30 | 20 |
| Unit 3 | 56                  | 100         | 90 | 80 | 70 | 60 | 50 | 40 | 30 | 20 |
| Unit 4 | 64                  | 110         | 99 | 88 | 77 | 66 | 55 | 44 | 33 | 22 |
| Unit 5 | 64                  | 110         | 99 | 88 | 77 | 66 | 55 | 44 | 33 | 22 |
| Unit 6 | 64                  | 110         | 99 | 88 | 77 | 66 | 55 | 44 | 33 | 22 |
| Unit 7 | 56                  | 70          | 63 | 56 | 49 | 42 | 35 | 28 | 21 | 14 |

For Units 1, 2 and 3, the maximum uniform mark available on the foundation tier of the assessment will be 69 (i.e. 1 uniform mark less than the minimum needed to achieve a grade B on the unit). For Unis 4, 5 and 6, the maximum uniform mark available on the foundation tier of the assessment will be 76.

The qualification double grade is awarded on an eight-grade scale A\*A\*-GG. Candidates who do not achieve the minimum uniform marks required to achieve a G will have their achievement recorded as U (unclassified).

The uniform marks obtained for each unit are added up and the qualification double grade is based on this total. The total results reported on UMS will have the following grade equivalences on the eight-grade scale:

|       | MAX. | A*<br>A* | AA  | BB  | CC  | DD  | EE  | FF  | GG  |
|-------|------|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Total | 700  | 630      | 560 | 490 | 420 | 350 | 280 | 210 | 140 |

# <span id="page-74-0"></span>APPENDIX B: Scientific Enquiry Skills Framework

To encourage learners to be curious and seek answers through science, they must have opportunities to develop scientific enquiry skills across all units. Centres must ensure that learners engage in scientific enquiry activities based on the subject content throughout the qualification.

## **1. Development of scientific thinking**

It is expected that the skills within this section will be developed through the teaching of the subject content within the specification.

## Learners should:

- understand how scientific models and theories develop over time
- use a variety of methods to solve problems, make predictions and to develop scientific explanations and understanding of familiar and unfamiliar facts
- the power and limitations of science and any ethical issues which may arise
- explain every day and technological applications of science
- evaluate personal, social, economic and environmental implications of science and make decisions based on the evaluation of evidence and arguments
- evaluate risks both in practical science and the wider societal context, including perception of risk in relation to data and consequences
- recognise the importance of peer review of results and of communicating results to a range of audiences.

## **2. Experimental skills and strategies**

It is expected that the skills within this section will be developed through the range of practical work used to support the teaching of the subject content within the specification.

#### Learners should:

- use scientific theories and explanations to develop hypotheses
- use scientific vocabulary, terminology and definitions
- plan experiments or devise procedures to make observations, make or identify substances, test hypotheses, check data or explore phenomena
- apply knowledge of a range of techniques, apparatus, and materials, and select those appropriate to the experiment
- carry out experiments appropriately having due regard to the correct setting up of apparatus, the accuracy of measurements and health and safety considerations
- recognise when to apply a knowledge of sampling techniques to ensure any samples collected are representative
- make and record observations and measurements using a range of apparatus and methods
- recognise the importance of scientific quantities and understand how they are determined
- evaluate methods and suggest possible improvements and further investigations
- present observations and other data using appropriate methods
- translate data from one form to another
- carry out mathematical analysis
- represent distributions of results and comment on uncertainties
- interpret primary and secondary data, including identifying patterns and trends, making inferences and drawing conclusions
- present explanations including relating data to hypotheses

{76}------------------------------------------------

- be objective and evaluate data in terms of accuracy, precision, repeatability and reproducibility and identify potential sources of random and systematic error
- communicate the scientific rationale for investigations and methods used.

| Dependent variable                 | The variable which you measure every time you change the<br>value of the independent variable.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Controlled variable                | A variable which may affect the results of the investigation and<br>therefore should be kept constant.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Control experiment                 | An experiment that is carried out where (usually) the<br>independent variable is removed or kept at a constant value,<br>whilst all other variable and methods remain the same.                                                                                  |

| Valid conclusion                   | A conclusion (what you found out) supported by the results of<br>data from a well-designed investigation and based on good<br>scientific knowledge.                                                                                                              |
| Validity of experimental<br>design | How suitable the method is to answer the question being<br>asked. The method should include controlled variables.                                                                                                                                                |
| Resolution                         | This is the smallest change in the quantity being measured by<br>a measuring instrument that can be observed. For example, $±$<br>1 mm on a 1 metre ruler or $	ext{±}1^{\circ}	ext{C}$ on a thermometer.                                                         |
| Anomaly                            | A value in a set of results which is seen to be much bigger or<br>smaller than the rest of the values in the set.                                                                                                                                                |
| True value                         | This is the value that would be obtained in ideal conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Uncertainty                        | The range within which the true value can be expected, e.g.<br>"the temperature is 20 $^{\circ}	ext{C}$ $	ext{±} 2^{\circ}	ext{C}$ ". There is a formula to<br>calculate this which you will be given in an exam.                                                |
| Measurement error                  | The difference between a measured value and the true<br>value.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Systematic error                   | A systematic error is normally caused by the apparatus used<br>and causes readings to differ from the true value by the same<br>amount each time. The effect of systematic errors cannot be<br>reduced by increased repeats.                                     |
| Random error                       | This occurs when results vary unpredictably from one<br>measurement to the next. These are normally due to errors by<br>the person taking the measurements. The effect of random<br>errors can be reduced by taking more measurements and<br>calculating a mean. |
| Accuracy                           | A measurement result is considered accurate if it is close to<br>the true value.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Term                               | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Inaccuracy                         | A measurement result is in accurate if it is a long way from the<br>true value                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Precision                          | A set of precise measurements show very little spread about<br>the mean value.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Repeatability                      | The precision obtained when repeat readings are obtained by<br>a single learner or group.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Repeatable                         | A measurement is repeatable, if a single learner or group<br>using the same method and apparatus, obtains the same or<br>similar results when they carry out the investigation again.                                                                            |
| Reproducibility                    | The precision obtained when repeat readings are obtained by<br>a different learners or groups.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Reproducible                       | A measurement is reproducible, if different learners or groups<br>obtain the same or similar results. This could include using<br>different apparatus or methods.                                                                                                |
| Hazard                             | A chemical or piece of apparatus that could cause harm. It is<br>expected that in risk assessments the nature of the hazard is<br>also specified. For example,<br>'Hydrogen peroxide is an<br>irritant'.                                                         |
| Risk                               | A step in the method involving a hazard that might result in<br>danger. For example,<br>'Hydrogen peroxide could get onto the<br>skin when pouring it into the measuring cylinder or the<br>beaker'.                                                             |
| Control measures                   | Something that can be done to reduce or prevent a risk while<br>still allowing you to carry out the experiment. For example,<br>'Wash hands immediately if any hydrogen peroxide gets onto<br>them'.                                                             |
