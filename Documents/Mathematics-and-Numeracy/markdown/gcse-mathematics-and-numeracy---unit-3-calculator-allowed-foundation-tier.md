**15.** A rugby team consists of 15 players. The Welsh rugby team played the Irish rugby team in February 2024.

The scatter diagram below shows the height and mass of each of the 15 Welsh players who started the game against Ireland.

![](_page_22_Figure_3.jpeg)

(a) Two of the players, each with a mass greater than 90 kg, have the same mass.

[2]

Find the difference between the heights of these two players. Give your answer in centimetres.

(b) Siôn believes the scatter diagram shows that there is a positive correlation between the height and mass of the 15 Welsh players.

**17.** The scale diagram below shows a plan view of Gruff's garden.

The scale used is **1cm represents 1 metre.**

Gruff's house is along the side BC.

There is a hedge along AB.

There is a fence along CD.

Gruff wants to plant a tree in the garden.

The tree must be

- nearer to the fence than the house
- less than 7 metres from the corner *A*.

Draw suitable lines on the diagram and shade the region where the tree could be planted.

### How to read the mark scheme

- 'M' marks are awarded for any correct method applied to appropriate working, even though a numerical error may be involved. Once earned they cannot be lost.
- 'm' marks are dependant method marks. They are only given if the relevant previous 'M' mark has been earned.
- 'A' marks are given for a numerically correct stage, for a correct result or for an answer lying within a specified range. They are only given if the relevant M/m mark has been earned either explicitly or by inference from the correct answer.
- 'B' marks are independent of method and are usually awarded for an accurate result or statement.
- 'S' marks are awarded for strategy
- 'E' marks are awarded for explanation
- 'U' marks are awarded for units
- 'P' marks are awarded for plotting points
- 'C' marks are awarded for drawing curves
- 'OC' marks are awarded for 'organising and communicating', a strand of OCW (organising, communicating and writing accurately)
- 'W' marks are awarded for 'writing accurately', a strand of OCW (organising, communicating and writing accurately)
- 'SC' marks are awards for special cases
- CAO: correct answer only
- ISW: ignore subsequent working
- FT: follow through
