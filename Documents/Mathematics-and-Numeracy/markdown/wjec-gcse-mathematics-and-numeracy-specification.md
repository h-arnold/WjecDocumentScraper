INTRODUCTION

1.1  Aims

GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy (Double Award) qualification supports learners to:
•  make connections between different areas of mathematics and with other areas

of the curriculum

•  develop their conceptual understanding in explaining, expressing and

representing concepts in both concrete and abstract forms

•  communicate both abstract situations and real-world scenarios using

mathematical symbols and expressions

•  develop their ability to use mathematical facts, techniques and relationships

•

fluently to solve problems
recognise underlying mathematical structures within problems and develop
strategies to solve them

•  develop an understanding of relationships between mathematical concepts and

the use of justifications and proofs

•  gain a strong foundation in financial mathematics to equip them for life and work
•  develop confidence in using and applying digital technology to help solve

mathematical and statistical problems.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales’ Approval Criteria.

1.2  Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy (Double Award) qualification is underpinned
by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that
learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for
this qualification. Central to this design are the principles of progression, along with
the statements of what matters and those subject specific skills and concepts
outlined in the ‘Designing your Curriculum’ section of the Mathematics and Numeracy
Area of Learning and Experiences

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to
embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral
skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple
mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for
Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for
integrating the learning experiences noted on page 47; the Guidance for Teaching
will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

GCSE MATHEMATICS AND NUMERACY (DOUBLE AWARD) 8

The construct of GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy (Double Award) is based on the
five interdependent proficiencies that make up the Curriculum for Wales’ principles of
progression for the Mathematics and Numeracy Area. These are:
•  conceptual understanding
•  communication using symbols
fluency
•
•
logical reasoning
•  strategic competence.

The content of GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy (Double Award) qualification is
based on the following mathematical and numerical concepts that make up the
Curriculum for Wales’ statements of what matters for the Mathematics and Numeracy
Area:
•  number
•  algebra
•  geometry and measures
•  statistics and probability.

Aspects of each concept are explored in every unit of the qualification, supporting the
statement that ‘the different areas of mathematics are highly interconnected and
dependent on one another’ included in the specific considerations for this Area.

The qualification also supports key links with other Areas of the Curriculum for
Wales, including developing learners’ financial literacy in support of learner
wellbeing.

1.3  Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is
designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the
conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages
3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills
and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares
learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation
for the study of Mathematics at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification
provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do
not progress to further study in this subject.

1.4  Guided learning hours

GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy (Double Award) has been designed to be
delivered within 240 – 280 guided learning hours. The qualification has been
primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

GCSE MATHEMATICS AND NUMERACY (DOUBLE AWARD) 9

1.5  Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our
language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect
and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and
adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising
that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to
ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres
of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always
be on the website.

1.6  Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic,
religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible,
features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access
and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual
orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to
enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills
without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the
following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access
Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This
document is available on the JCQ website (http://www.jcq.org.uk/).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of
provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete
barrier to any part of the assessment.

Questions set in context

Learners will be required to respond to questions set in context and context-free questions in
all three written examinations.

Where questions are in context, they will be set in one of the following contextual categories:
•  personal contexts which could include but are not limited to:

•  personal finance
•  personal health
•

travel

•  careers, employment and work-based contexts which could include but are not limited to:

timekeeping

•
•  payroll
•

finances

•  societal contexts which could include but are not limited to:

•  economy
•  demographics

•  scientific, technological and environmental contexts could include but are not limited to:

•  climate

Unit 1 has a specific focus on assessing learners through personal and other real-world
contexts. Learners will be required to select and apply mathematical methods to these real-
world contexts.

Unit 2 focuses on mathematics that doesn’t require the use of a calculator, and has an
emphasis on algebra, probability and geometry.

The paper will include context-free questions and questions set in mathematical and other
contexts.

Unit 3 will have some questions that are in context, and others that are context-free. The
questions in context will mainly focus on statistics and measures.

Organising, communicating and writing accurately

Two marks will be awarded on each examination paper, at each tier, for the assessment of
‘communicating, organising and writing accurately’. These marks will be in addition to the
marks allocated to the mathematics. One mark will be awarded for communicating and
organising. The other mark will be awarded for writing accurately. These questions will be
clearly indicated on each examination paper.

For marks relating to organisation and communication, candidates will be expected to:
•  present their response in a structured way
•  explain to the reader what they are doing at each step of their response
•
•  write a conclusion that draws together their results and explains what their answer

lay out their explanations and working in a clear and logical way

means

For marks relating to writing accurately candidates will be expected to:
•  show all their working
•  use correct mathematical form in their working
•  use appropriate terminology, units, etc.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

5.1  Entries and awards

This is a unitised qualification. Candidates are entered for each unit separately.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer and November
assessment period each year, until the end of the life of the specification.

Unit 1 and Unit 2 will be available in the summer 2026 and November 2026 (and
each year thereafter). Unit 3 will be available in November 2026 and summer 2027
(and each year thereafter) and the qualification will be awarded for the first time in
November 2026.

Pre-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or under on 31st August in the
academic year in which they were entered)

The terminal rule is set at 30% of the overall qualification for Pre-16 Candidates for
GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy (Double Award).

If the assessment being re-taken contributes to the 30% terminal rule requirement,
the mark for the new assessment will count regardless of previous results in that
assessment.

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score
from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade subject to the
terminal rule being satisfied first i.e. that candidates must complete 30% of the
assessment for a qualification in the series in which they are cashing in.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the
third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s).
This is referred to as a 'fresh start'. When re-taking a qualification (fresh start), a
candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from
examination units taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating the new
grade(s).

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not
count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in
the final resit series.

Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1st September in the
academic year in which they are entered)

There is no terminal rule that applies to Post-16 Candidates from GCSE Mathematics
and Numeracy (Double Award).

There is no limit on the number of times a candidate can resit an individual unit;
however, the better uniform mark score from only the two most recent attempts will
be used in calculating the final overall grade.

The ‘fresh start’ rule does not apply to post-16 candidates.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2024

GCSE MATHEMATICS AND NUMERACY (DOUBLE AWARD) 59

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not
count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in

5.2  Grading, awarding and reporting

GCSE double award qualifications are reported on an eight grade scale from A*A*-
GG, where A*A* is the highest grade. Results not attaining the minimum standard for
the award will be reported as U (unclassified).

5.3

Tiering

There are two tiers of entry for each unit of qualification.
Higher Tier: A* – D
Foundation Tier: C – G

Learners may be entered at different tiers across units.

The raw marks gained in each of the three units will be converted to give a learner a
Uniform Marks Scale (UMS) mark for each unit. The maximum UMS available for
each assessment will be in line with the grades available for the tier taken in each
assessment. These will then be aggregated to give a final UMS mark, providing a
learner’s overall grade in this qualification.

For Units 1 and 2, the maximum uniform mark available on the foundation tier of the
assessment will be 83 (i.e. 1 uniform mark less than the minimum needed to achieve
a grade B on the unit). For Unit 3, the maximum uniform mark available on the
foundation tier of the assessment will be 111.

The qualification double grade is awarded on an eight-grade scale A*A*-GG.
Candidates who do not achieve the minimum uniform marks required to achieve a G
will have their achievement recorded as U (unclassified).

The uniform marks obtained for each unit are added up and the qualification double
grade is based on this total. The total results reported on UMS will have the following
