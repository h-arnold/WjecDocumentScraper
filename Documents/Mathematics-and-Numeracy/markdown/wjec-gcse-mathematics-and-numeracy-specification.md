## GCSE MATHEMATICS AND NUMERACY (DOUBLE AWARD)

<span id="page-7-0"></span>

#### 1. INTRODUCTION

<span id="page-7-1"></span>

##### 1.1 Aims

GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy (Double Award) qualification supports learners to:

- make connections between different areas of mathematics and with other areas of the curriculum
- develop their conceptual understanding in explaining, expressing and representing concepts in both concrete and abstract forms
- communicate both abstract situations and real-world scenarios using mathematical symbols and expressions
- develop their ability to use mathematical facts, techniques and relationships fluently to solve problems
- recognise underlying mathematical structures within problems and develop strategies to solve them
- develop an understanding of relationships between mathematical concepts and the use of justifications and proofs
- gain a strong foundation in financial mathematics to equip them for life and work
- develop confidence in using and applying digital technology to help solve mathematical and statistical problems.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales' Approval Criteria.

<span id="page-7-2"></span>

##### 1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy (Double Award) qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/mathematics-and-numeracy/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of what matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/mathematics-and-numeracy/statements-of-what-matters/) and those [subject specific skills and concepts](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/mathematics-and-numeracy/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area) outlined in the '[Designing your Curriculum](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/mathematics-and-numeracy/designing-your-curriculum/)' section of the Mathematics and Numeracy Area of Learning and Experiences

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted on page 47; the Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery. 

{9}------------------------------------------------

The construct of GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy (Double Award) is based on the five interdependent proficiencies that make up the Curriculum for Wales' principles of progression for the Mathematics and Numeracy Area. These are:

- conceptual understanding
- communication using symbols
- fluency
- logical reasoning
- strategic competence.

The content of GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy (Double Award) qualification is based on the following mathematical and numerical concepts that make up the Curriculum for Wales' statements of what matters for the Mathematics and Numeracy Area:

- number
- algebra
- geometry and measures
- statistics and probability.

Aspects of each concept are explored in every unit of the qualification, supporting the statement that 'the different areas of mathematics are highly interconnected and dependent on one another' included in the specific considerations for this Area.

The qualification also supports key links with other Areas of the Curriculum for Wales, including developing learners' financial literacy in support of learner wellbeing.

## <span id="page-8-0"></span>1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of Mathematics at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

## <span id="page-8-1"></span>1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy (Double Award) has been designed to be delivered within 240 – 280 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

{10}------------------------------------------------

### <span id="page-9-0"></span>1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

## <span id="page-9-1"></span>1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website [\(http://www.jcq.org.uk/\)](http://www.jcq.org.uk/).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

### Opportunities for integration of learning experiences

The GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy (Double Award) qualification generates opportunities for the following learning experiences to be developed (these experiences will not be directly assessed):

- develop their integral skills and cross-curricular skills in literacy and digital competency
- work both independently and collaboratively
- make appropriate connections with other parts of the curriculum in order to appreciate the role mathematics plays in other subject areas
- gain awareness and appreciation of some of the different careers and work-related areas that draw upon mathematics
- access rich tasks that invoke curiosity, build resilience and require Learners to be resourceful
- undertake practical work that allows Learners to apply their mathematical skills inside and outside of the classroom setting
- access digital technologies to enhance digital understanding and strengthen mathematical and numeracy skills
- encounter familiar, unfamiliar and complex problems.

Further amplification of the opportunities to develop cross-cutting themes, cross-curricular skills and integral skills can be seen in Appendix A.

The Assessment Pack will include all detailed information relating to assessment.

## <span id="page-49-1"></span>3.1 Assessment objectives and weightings

Below are the assessment objectives for this specification. Learners must:

#### **AO1**

#### **Recall and use their knowledge of the prescribed content:**

- demonstrate conceptual understanding through remembering and using mathematical facts, relationships, concepts and techniques
- follow direct instructions to solve problems involving routine procedures fluently

#### **AO2**

#### **Select and apply mathematical methods:**

- select and use the mathematics and resources needed to solve a problem fluently
- select and apply mathematical methods to solve nonstandard or unstructured, multi-step problems fluently
- make decisions when tackling a given task, for example, choosing how to display given information
- communicate mathematically, using a wide range of mathematical language, notation and symbols to explain reasoning and to express mathematical ideas unambiguously

{51}------------------------------------------------

#### **AO3**

**Demonstrate strategic competence by making connections between different aspects of mathematics and using mathematical skills in unfamiliar contexts:**

- demonstrate strategic competence by interpreting and analysing problems and generating strategies to solve them
- devise strategies to solve non-routine or unfamiliar problems, breaking them into smaller, more manageable tasks where necessary
- construct arguments and proofs using logical reasoning and deduction
- interpret findings or solutions in the context of the original problem
- use inferences and deductions made from mathematical information to draw conclusions

The table below shows the weighting of each assessment objective in each unit for the qualification as a whole, within a tolerance of +/- 5 percentage points for the overall weightings.

## <span id="page-51-0"></span>Questions set in context

Learners will be required to respond to questions set in context and context-free questions in all three written examinations.

Where questions are in context, they will be set in one of the following contextual categories:

- personal contexts which could include but are not limited to:
  - personal finance
  - personal health
  - travel
- careers, employment and work-based contexts which could include but are not limited to:
  - timekeeping
  - payroll
  - finances
- societal contexts which could include but are not limited to:
  - economy
  - demographics
- scientific, technological and environmental contexts could include but are not limited to:
  - climate
  - medicine
  - computing.

**Unit 1** has a specific focus on assessing learners through personal and other real-world contexts. Learners will be required to select and apply mathematical methods to these realworld contexts.

**Unit 2** focuses on mathematics that doesn't require the use of a calculator, and has an emphasis on algebra, probability and geometry.

The paper will include context-free questions and questions set in mathematical and other contexts.

**Unit 3** will have some questions that are in context, and others that are context-free. The questions in context will mainly focus on statistics and measures.

## <span id="page-51-1"></span>Organising, communicating and writing accurately

Two marks will be awarded on each examination paper, at each tier, for the assessment of 'communicating, organising and writing accurately'. These marks will be in addition to the marks allocated to the mathematics. One mark will be awarded for communicating and organising. The other mark will be awarded for writing accurately. These questions will be clearly indicated on each examination paper.

For marks relating to organisation and communication, candidates will be expected to:

- present their response in a structured way
- explain to the reader what they are doing at each step of their response
- lay out their explanations and working in a clear and logical way
- write a conclusion that draws together their results and explains what their answer means

For marks relating to writing accurately candidates will be expected to:

- show all their working
- use correct mathematical form in their working
- use appropriate terminology, units, etc.

{53}------------------------------------------------

## <span id="page-52-0"></span>Use of calculators

Calculators must meet the regulations set out below.

#### **Calculators must be:**

- of a size suitable for use on the desk
- either battery or solar powered

## <span id="page-57-0"></span>4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy (Double Award)

Information regarding malpractice is available in our [Guide to preventing, reporting and](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)  [investigating malpractice.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC (malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet [Suspected](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)  [Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)

### 5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

<span id="page-58-1"></span>

##### 5.1 Entries and awards

This is a unitised qualification. Candidates are entered for each unit separately.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer and November assessment period each year, until the end of the life of the specification.

Unit 1 and Unit 2 will be available in the summer 2026 and November 2026 (and each year thereafter). Unit 3 will be available in November 2026 and summer 2027 (and each year thereafter) and the qualification will be awarded for the first time in November 2026.

##### Pre-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or under on 31st August in the academic year in which they were entered)

The terminal rule is set at 30% of the overall qualification for Pre-16 Candidates for GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy (Double Award).

If the assessment being re-taken contributes to the 30% terminal rule requirement, the mark for the new assessment will count regardless of previous results in that assessment.

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade subject to the terminal rule being satisfied first i.e. that candidates must complete 30% of the assessment for a qualification in the series in which they are cashing in.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s). This is referred to as a 'fresh start'. When re-taking a qualification (fresh start), a candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from examination units taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating the new grade(s).

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

##### Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1st September in the academic year in which they are entered)

There is no terminal rule that applies to Post-16 Candidates from GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy (Double Award).

There is no limit on the number of times a candidate can resit an individual unit; however, the better uniform mark score from only the two most recent attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade.

The 'fresh start' rule does not apply to post-16 candidates.

{60}------------------------------------------------

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

The entry codes appear below:

| Unit                                                 |                                                                | Entry codes    |              |

<span id="page-59-0"></span>

##### 5.2 Grading, awarding and reporting

GCSE double award qualifications are reported on an eight grade scale from A\*A\*- GG, where A\*A\* is the highest grade. Results not attaining the minimum standard for the award will be reported as U (unclassified).

<span id="page-59-1"></span>

##### 5.3 Tiering

There are two tiers of entry for each unit of qualification.

Higher Tier: A\* – D Foundation Tier: C – G

Learners may be entered at different tiers across units.

The raw marks gained in each of the three units will be converted to give a learner a Uniform Marks Scale (UMS) mark for each unit. The maximum UMS available for each assessment will be in line with the grades available for the tier taken in each assessment. These will then be aggregated to give a final UMS mark, providing a learner's overall grade in this qualification.

{61}------------------------------------------------

Individual units are recorded on a uniform mark scale (UMS) with the following grade equivalences:

| Unit       | Max raw<br>marks | Max<br>UMS | A*  | A   | B   | C  | D  | E  | F  | G  |
|------------|------------------|------------|-----|-----|-----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 1<br>(30%) | 80               | 120        | 108 | 96  | 84  | 72 | 60 | 48 | 36 | 24 |
| 2<br>(30%) | 80               | 120        | 108 | 96  | 84  | 72 | 60 | 48 | 36 | 24 |
| 3<br>(40%) | 90               | 160        | 144 | 128 | 112 | 96 | 80 | 64 | 48 | 32 |

For Units 1 and 2, the maximum uniform mark available on the foundation tier of the assessment will be 83 (i.e. 1 uniform mark less than the minimum needed to achieve a grade B on the unit). For Unit 3, the maximum uniform mark available on the foundation tier of the assessment will be 111.

The qualification double grade is awarded on an eight-grade scale A\*A\*-GG. Candidates who do not achieve the minimum uniform marks required to achieve a G will have their achievement recorded as U (unclassified).

The uniform marks obtained for each unit are added up and the qualification double grade is based on this total. The total results reported on UMS will have the following grade equivalences on the eight-grade scale:

| Unit  | Max raw<br>marks | Max<br>UMS | A*A* | AA  | BB  | CC  | DD  | EE  | FF  | GG |
|-------|------------------|------------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|----|
| Total | 250              | 400        | 360  | 320 | 280 | 240 | 200 | 160 | 120 | 80 |
