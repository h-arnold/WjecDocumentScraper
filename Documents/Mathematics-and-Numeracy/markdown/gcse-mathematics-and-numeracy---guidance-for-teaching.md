{9}------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="page-9-0"></span>Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:

- Specification this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to know by the end of their course.
- Assessment Pack this contains the Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) i.e.: sample exam papers and mark schemes

#### <span id="page-9-1"></span>Command words

Learners should be made aware of:

- what command words are
- what each command word means
- what each command word assesses.

Command words are the words and phrases used in assessments that tell learners how they should answer the question or complete the task. Command words direct the learner through the question or task and indicate the nature of the response required.

![](_page_9_Picture_11.jpeg)

# <span id="page-9-2"></span>Mark Schemes

Mark schemes and/or assessment criteria test the intended learning outcomes for a component. They describe the knowledge and skills (and possibly attitude) that a candidate is expected to demonstrate in their responses and they are then used in marking the work.

#### **Objective based mark scheme:**

For very short answer questions requiring one correct response.

| Question |  | Answer |  | Total Mark |  |

{10}------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="page-10-0"></span>Summary of changes

There are topics from the 2015 specifications that have been removed for this qualification.

#### The main topics are:

- interpreting and applying the transformation of functions in the context of their graphical representation, including y = f(x + a), y = f(kx), y = kf(x) and y = f(x) + a, applied to y = f(x)
- constructing using a ruler and a pair of compasses
- solving problems in the context of tiling patterns and tessellation
- distinguishing between formulae for length, area and volume by considering dimensions
- describing translations using column vectors
- drawing and interpreting graphs of y = ax + b + a/x and y = k<sup>x</sup> for integer values of x and simple positive values of k.

In addition to these, the following changes are also being introduced:

- the focus of teaching and learning will be on interpreting and using rather than drawing, in topics including nets, plans and elevations, and box and whisker diagrams
- all metric-imperial conversions will be given in question, so candidates will no longer be required to memorise some of these conversion factors.

Some topics in the specification have been extended from what was made explicit in the 2015 specifications. For example:

- solving quadratics and cubics graphically (section 2.4.10 of the specification)
- double inequalities (section 2.2.4 of the specification)
- the use of dotted lines in inequalities and regions questions (section 2.4.5 of the specification)

Please see the entries in the next section of this guidance for more information about specific topics.

# Teacher Guidance

The examples provided in this document are intended to support teaching and learning by illustrating key concepts, strategies, or extreme cases. While they help to clarify the specification, they are not necessarily indicative of the types of questions that will necessarily appear in exams. These examples are meant to enhance understanding, and although similar questions could be asked in exams, there is no guarantee that they will. This guidance serves as a teaching tool and should not be used as a definitive guide to future exam content.

| 1.2.1 | the common properties of numbers, including knowledge of odd, even, integers, multiples, factors, primes | In examinations, common number properties can either be directly assessed (e.g. selecting numbers to fit given properties) or assessed indirectly, through assumed prior knowledge within other questions.  Algebra could be used to explain or prove number properties.  For example:  • $n$ represents a whole number. Is $2n + 3$ odd or even?  • Explain why every term of the sequence $4n + 2$ is an even number.  • For all integers, $n$ , is $5n - 3$ odd, even, or sometimes odd and sometimes even?  • Show that $3(2n + 3) - (2n + 7)$ is even for all integers, $n$ .

If asked to simplify an answer, an improper fraction (provided not equivalent to a whole number) will be sufficient as long as the numerator and denominator are as small as possible. For example:  For $3\frac{2}{3}$ , accept $\frac{11}{3}$ but not, for example, $1\frac{8}{3}$ or $\frac{22}{6}$ or $3\frac{4}{6}$ .  Remember to simplify improper fractions or mixed numbers  • For $4\frac{1}{2} \times 2\frac{2}{3} = 12$ , do not leave the answer as $\frac{72}{6}$ or $\frac{12}{1}$ .  • For $1\frac{5}{7} + 2\frac{11}{14} = 4\frac{1}{2}$ or $\frac{9}{2}$ , do not leave the answer as $3\frac{21}{14}$ . | <b>✓</b> | <b>✓</b> | <b>✓</b> |  |

|  |  | When questions are in context, learners must interpret the situation carefully to ensure that the numerator and denominator used in the calculation are the correct values. In final answers, percentages must be written using the percentage symbol, not as fractions with denominators of 100, e.g. 30%, not 30 |   |   |   |  |  |
| 1.4.7 | find a fraction or percentage of a quantity | 100 The method will depend on whether a calculator is allowed or not. For example: If a calculator is allowed, it is not efficient to find 36% by splitting it into a combination of 10%, 5% and 1%. |  |  |  |  |  |
| 1.4.8 | calculate fractional and percentage changes (increase and decrease) | This is now only assessed on units where a calculator is allowed. So, non-calculator methods should not be used. For example: Sali buys a painting that has a value of £120. Its value 3 years later is £198. Calculate the percentage increase in the value of the painting. Calculation: (198 – 120) ×100 = 65%. 120 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 1.4.9 | understand and use multipliers | For example: <ul><li>Find 6% of 300: multiplier is 0.06</li><li>Increase 300 by 6%: multiplier is 1.06</li><li>Decrease 300 by 6%: multiplier is 0.94</li></ul> |  |  |  |  |  |
| 1.4.10 | solve problems with repeated proportional changes | For example: A company is set up with 500 workers. At the end of each year the company employs more workers. The number of additional workers employed at the end of each year is equal to two-fifths of the number of workers at the start of that year. How many people work for the company at the start of the fourth year? |  |  |  |  |  |

| 1.8.2 understand the basic principles of personal/ household finance and enterprise in order to solve problems relating to, for example: <ul><li>wages and salaries, including payslips</li><li>taxation, including income tax and National Insurance</li><li>savings and investments</li><li>loans/repayments</li><li>mortgages</li><li>appreciation/depreciation</li><li>budgeting</li><li>bank statements</li><li>utility bills</li><li>mobile phone and other bills</li><li>VAT</li><li>best buys</li><li>price comparison</li><li>finance schemes, including buying by instalments</li><li>discount/price increase</li><li>buying and selling</li><li>profit and loss</li><li>travel including foreign currencies, exchange rates and commission.</li></ul> | Note, in tax questions within assessments, whilst foreign currencies will still be used, pounds (£) will also be used, but the tax rates might not match the current UK tax rates. Mortgages serve as another context to practise financial skills, such as percentages and taxes. Students should have a basic understanding of repayment mortgages and be able to compare mortgage products or determine the required deposit amount. For more in-depth questions, such as calculating monthly payments, loan amounts needed for a specific monthly payment or the remaining balance on a loan, all necessary information will be provided within the questions. At foundation tier, working with percentages and an understanding of how to use simple formulae will be required. Complicated calculations, contexts or formulae will increase the difficulty of questions and could result in them being assessed at higher grades. Examples of terms that learners will be expected to be aware of: Profit and loss: profit, loss, costs, revenue, appreciation, depreciation. Income tax: income tax, personal allowance, taxable income, basic rate, higher rate, currency, National Insurance (NIC). Finance schemes: overdraft, credit, debit, loan, budget, payment plan, interest, mortgage, personal loan, repayments, lump sum, instalment, initial payment, insurance (e.g. house insurance), crowdfunding. Bills: direct debit, utility bills, meter readings, VAT, mobile phone bills, contracts, airtime, monthly payments, standing charge, kilowatt-hours. |         |  |  |  |  |

|  |  | However, we will NOT ask learners to simplify 3 , for example, as the only way to simply this √2 fraction is to multiply the numerator and denominator by √2. |  |  |  |  |
| 1.9.6 | use pi in exact calculations | For example: A cylinder fits exactly inside a square-based cuboid. Find the ratio of the volume of the cylinder to the volume of the cuboid. Leave your answer in the form π : a, where a is an integer. Note: it is possible that an exact answer is needed even in Unit 3, especially if it is the answer to the first part of a question, where an approximate answer could result in premature rounding, which would lead to inaccuracy further on. For example: cm has an area of 100cm2 A sector of a circle with radius 5 Write the sector angle in terms of π. Hence, calculate the exact length of the arc of the sector. |  |  |  |  |
| 1.9.7 | use surds in exact calculations | Note that premature rounding in the first part of a question or solution could lead to inaccuracy further on. For example: Calculate the length of side AB.

| 4.2.5 | draw 'by eye' a line of 'best fit' and understand and interpret what this represents. In questions where the mean point has been given, calculated or plotted, candidates will be expected to draw the line of 'best fit' through that point | For example: A scatter graph shows marks of 10 students in two tests, chemistry and physics. The mean chemistry mark is 52. The total of all the physics marks is 560. Plot the mean point and use this point to draw a line of best fit. If the line of best fit is expected to go through the mean point, a tighter tolerance will apply for the position of the line. The line of best fit should be drawn with a ruler and follow the general trend of the data points. The line should roughly pass through the middle of all the points, with some points above the line and some points below. The length of the line must be at least the distance from the first to last point on the diagram. Learners will be expected to make predictions from the line of best fit, but also realise when it is not appropriate to do so. They should also be aware that some points may not follow the same pattern as the rest. |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.2.6 | interpret and draw conclusions from scatter diagrams; use terms such as positive correlation, negative correlation, little or no correlation | Examination questions could ask for the type of correlation, and some questions could ask to explain what the correlation means in the context of the question. If an explanation is asked for, then explicit reference must be made to the variables in the question. Responses such as 'as one goes up and so does the other' will not be awarded marks. |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.2.7 | appreciate that correlation does not imply causality |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

|  |  | t The median time is the 18th value, which is in the group 54 < < 58 seconds. The 18th value is (18 – 4) / 16 of the way up from 54. = 14/16 of the way up from the lower bound of the group. (Note that the '4' in the calculation is the total frequency of all groups lower than the group the median is in.) Therefore, the estimate of the median value is 54 + (14/16) x 4 = 57.5. Note that the calculation is similar when we use the 18.5th person, which is strictly more correct. The median then is 57.625. However, as we're estimating the median, and there isn't a significant difference between the two answers, particularly when the total frequency is large, using 18 is easier and is acceptable in examination questions. Note that the data could be presented in a histogram instead of in a grouped frequency table. |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| 4.4.1 | that if A and B are mutually exclusive events, then the probability of A or B occurring is P(A) + P(B) |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.4.2 | that if A and B are independent events, then the probability of A and B occurring is P(A) x P(B) | Note that learners need to understand the formula for independent events at foundation tier. On foundation tier, it is used in simple tree diagram questions, but also in questions that do not involve tree diagrams. |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | For example: Two unbiased 6-sided dice are rolled at the same time. Calculate the probability that: (a) both dice land on a six (b) the first dice lands on a 3 and the second dice lands on a 5. |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | Note that in the above example, asking for the probability that 'one dice lands on a 3 and the other dice lands on a 5' would be too demanding for foundation tier, as it involves different permutations. However, it could be asked at foundation tier if the question was set up using a tree diagram or a sample space diagram, such as a two-way table of outcomes. |  |  |  |  |
| 4.4.3 | identify all the outcomes of a combination of experiments, including lists, sample space diagrams, tree diagrams and Venn diagrams | Examples could include identifying outcomes for up to 3 events as follows: <ul><li>different combinations of starter, main course and dessert</li><li>a tree diagram with three sets of branches</li><li>a Venn Diagram with 3 sets.</li></ul> |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | Note that at foundation tier, examination questions on tree diagrams will be relatively simple. We will not expect candidates to find P(B) when P(A) × P(B) is known, and we will not expect candidates to calculate complicated additions of probabilities, e.g. in tree diagrams with three sets of branches. |  |  |  |  |

| 1. Develop their integral skills and cross-curricular skills in literacy and digital competency | Curriculum for Wales | Exemplification of this learning experience can be found in the opportunities for embedding elements of the section found later in this guidance. |  |  |
| 2. Work both independently and collaboratively | The ability to work independently is crucial to all learners tracking their own progress through this specification. Independent work encourages learners to take ownership of their own studies, leading to a better understanding and retention of mathematical concepts. Habits formed during GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy can ease transition to further and higher education, where self-directed study is crucial. Equally, mathematics is a subject in which collaborative discussion of solutions, misconceptions and approaches is hugely impactful on progress. Both independent and collaborative learning are imperative in supporting the development of learners' mathematical fluency, conceptual understanding, logical reasoning, strategic competence and communication with symbols.

When teachers give instructions for activities and explain methods, learners need to listen carefully to understand what is expected of them and to grasp the explanations effectively. Learners also benefit through listening to their peers' ideas and arguments. This helps them build on others' thoughts, ask relevant questions and contribute meaningfully to classroom discussion. Listening effectively to a teacher's feedback is also crucial so that learners can close a gap in understanding, be aware of their strengths and to identify their areas of development. Good listening skills improve the ability to communicate effectively in both personal and professional settings. These skills will continue to benefit learners when they leave school, allowing them to understand others more effectively, to respond appropriately and to build stronger relationships.

Listening

|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
| 2.5.2 | Interpret graphical representation used in the media, recognising that some graphs may be misleading | Think-pair-share activities are useful in developing a learner's listening skills, and this concept lends itself perfectly to that type of task. Learners could be presented with two contradictory arguments, both supported by data shown on a graph. Learners would then listen to each other before presenting their own argument and eventually discovering how some graphs can be misleading. |  |
| 3.4.4 | Circle theorems: The tangent at any point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point | Listening skills are important when discovering circle theorems, particularly the very distinct vocabulary associated with the topic. A useful starter activity would be to discuss with a partner how to correctly label parts of a circle. Online software is a useful tool for exploring and discovering circle theorems. Working in pairs, learners could investigate and listen to each other's findings before formalising the rules. |  |

Reading skills are very important and have a significant impact on learner achievement in mathematics lessons. Firstly, the ability to read and understand a variety of mathematical vocabulary can be fundamental to a learner's success. For example, words like product, difference, volume and base can be confusing without proper context. Learners need to be able to interpret worded questions, scan questions for key information, and infer and deduce the best approach to answering a question.

Fostering strong reading skills in mathematics lessons not only aids in comprehension but also enhances critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. These skills are essential in many professions and can foster a habit of continuous learning. In everyday life, learners will often need to be able to read information from a variety of sources including tables and graphs for example, to organise a schedule or plan a trip.

# Reading

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.7.1 Interpret and use mathematical information presented in written or visual form, including infographics, schedules, timetables, calendars and charts |  | Use of local bus/train timetables is a very engaging way to interest learners and develop their reading skills. Planning journeys and trips with given criteria and deadlines will help them locate and retrieve key information in order to be successful. For more examples of infographics, please look at the new Blended Learning resource on the Resources website: Educational Resources - WJEC |
| 4.2.6 | Interpret and draw conclusions from scatter diagrams: use terms such as positive correlation, negative correlation, little or no correlation | The ability to read graphs, but also to infer and deduce connections between variables is an important skill. Using knowledge of correlation, learners could be given a mix and match style activity to identify which mixed up pairs of variables could match different correlations. |

{79}------------------------------------------------

The specification content enables learners to verbally present their thoughts, strategies, reasoning and justifications to peers and teachers using subject specific language, in a classroom environment. When learners articulate their mathematical thinking, their depth of knowledge expands. Discussing both their problems and solutions helps learners clarify their thoughts and identify any misconceptions. Oracy skills can also help to foster a collaborative learning environment. Learners can work together to solve problems, share strategies and learn from each other. Throughout life, the ability to speak effectively will improve a learners' ability to participate in discussions, ask questions and seek feedback. Strong oracy skills improve the ability to communicate effectively in various settings, from personal relationships to professional environments. Speaking skills allow learners explore and debate different perspectives, understand the consequences of actions and make informed, ethical choices.

#### Speaking

| 4.1.3 | Design and criticise questions for a questionnaire, including notions of fairness and bias | Learners can develop both their speaking and their thinking skills when designing questionnaires and trialling them by reading them aloud. Their peers will critique the questions they are asked and suggest improvements to make the survey more efficient and free from bias. |
| 4.2.19 | Interpret and use box and whisker diagrams to compare distributions | Learners could be given a selection of box and whisker diagrams to compare different distributions before presenting their findings to their peers. Whole class questioning on this topic is useful to probe the depth of their understanding of the limitations and usefulness of the charts. |

{80}------------------------------------------------

|  | Writing skills play a crucial role in mathematics lessons, helping learners to articulate their understanding and thought processes. This is evident when they solve problems and write their steps to reach the solution. In worded questions, learners demonstrate their understanding through their written work using the correct vocabulary and units, but also by communicating effectively and organising their work sensibly. These skills assessed formally in questions that award marks for organising, communicating and writing accurately (OCW). These are lifelong skills; writing is fundamental to effective communication which is crucial in both personal and professional settings. |  |  |

| Writing | Specification Reference | Amplification | Example(s) |
|  | 1.7.2 | Create plans and schedules | A useful task to develop writing skills in mathematics would be to put together a bullet point itinerary for a day at a local beach to include travel plans to get there, an activity whilst there and budgeting. This could then be presented to a younger learner to check for clarity and accuracy. |
|  | 2.2.1 | Form, manipulate and solve linear and other simple equations with whole number and fractional coefficients | Learners could be asked to apply their knowledge of the perimeter of shapes to form and solve equations in terms of x. This develops their writing skills to organise their work and communicate clearly. |

{81}------------------------------------------------

#### **Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy**

Central to the specification is an ambition to develop learners into efficient, fluent mathematicians who can apply their skills in unfamiliar contexts across the curriculum and in many different real-life situations. Numeracy skills are at the core of the specification and as such, amplifications and examples are evident throughout. AO3 also requires learners to demonstrate strategic competence, which contributes to 20% of the assessment. Mathematical proficiency is crucial in life outside the classroom and life after school, having fluency and accuracy in calculations is important regardless of the path a learner decides to take. The structured approach of this specification ensures that learners not only learn mathematical concepts but also understand their applications, thereby developing a well-rounded mathematical proficiency.

#### **Integral Skills**

Integrating opportunities for learners to be creative and innovative into the teaching of GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy will enhance learners' problem-solving skills. Exploring mathematics in real-life contexts can create opportunities that foster creativity, innovation, curiosity and inquisitiveness. Learners can make links across subject disciplines and develop a depth of knowledge. Giving learners open-ended or challenging problems will allow them to think creatively, explore different strategies and develop their reasoning and communication skills. Combining multiple mathematical topic areas to create mathematical problems will encourage learners to think creatively about what they know, what they need to find out and what mathematical strategies they then need to apply in order to solve the problem.

{88}------------------------------------------------

Critical Thinking and Problem Solving are skills that can be developed and enhanced through the teaching and learning of GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy. This can be achieved by offering opportunities for learners to engage in numerical reasoning, logical reasoning, justifications, proof of relationships, critical thinking and problem solving.

Learners have opportunities to investigate how to solve problems, in new, varied and real-life contexts, and discuss, question, and generate their own ideas or alternative strategies on how to solve them. These skills can be applied to all areas of mathematics outlined in the specification. Real-life problems require learners to apply mathematical concepts to practical scenarios, often with no obvious starting point. Learners have to think critically about the methods they choose to solve problems.

Many GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy problems require learners to use multiple steps or combine various mathematical concepts to reach a solution. This builds problem-solving resilience and encourages logical reasoning as learners break down complex problems into manageable parts.

| 2.2.6 | Form, manipulate and solve two simultaneous linear equations with whole number coefficients by algebraic methods | Solving a worded simultaneous equation requires learners to first identify that simultaneous equations are the mathematical concept that needs to be applied, then set up the equations from the problem and subsequently use an algebraic method to solve the equations and find the unknown variables. They must think critically about how to simplify and manipulate the equations effectively. |
| 3.4.5 | Circle theorems: <ul><li>The tangent at any point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point</li><li>The angle subtended by an arc at the centre of a circle is twice the angle subtended at any point on the circumference</li></ul> | Questions on circle theorems require critical thinking and problem solving to break down complex problems and to recognise patterns and relationships. Learners will need to apply multiple theorems in a logical sequence. They will need to make decisions on relationships and facts such as whether specific lines are equal in length or whether certain points lie on the circumference. Some problems may require learners to draw additional lines and think creatively about how to modify the diagram to unlock solutions. |

| 3.6.1 | Perimeter and area of a square, rectangle, triangle, parallelogram, trapezium, circle, semicircle and a composite shape | Learners need to think critically and problem solve to find the area of a shaded region or composite shape with unknown lengths. In order to find the area of the shaded region, learners could calculate a missing length using reverse area strategies. Learners could be asked to find the area and perimeter of a semi-circle or quarter of a circle and think critically about what calculations they would need to carry out. |
| 3.7.3 | Use trigonometric relationships in right-angled triangles to solve problems, including those involving bearings and angles of elevation and depression | Learners will need to apply critical thinking and problem-solving strategies to multi-step questions involving multiple triangles that require the use trigonometry or Pythagoras to find unknown angles or lengths. Learners need to know what formulae are required, and how to use substitution and algebraic manipulation strategies. Learners need to think strategically about the order they need to carry out calculations and look at the sensibility of the calculations at each step. |

{90}------------------------------------------------

**Planning and Organisation** are essential skills that can be developed through the teaching of GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy. These skills enable learners to approach problems systematically. Integrating opportunities for planning and organisation into lessons, teachers can help learners become more independent and efficient.

Encouraging learners to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps and plan their approach before solving them will develop their planning and organisational skills. When tackling a complex question, learners can first write down a plan outlining the steps they will take, the theorems or methods they will apply, and the order in which they will proceed. This builds on their ability to organise their thoughts and systematically work through problems. Learners need to know how to organise their work clearly, showing all steps of their calculations or reasoning to avoid careless mistakes.

Through learning how to interpret timetables, charts, calendars and schedules, and create plans and schedules learners are supported to develop their own planning and organisation skills.

| Planning and |

| Organisation |

| Specification Reference | Amplification | Example(s) |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.7.1 | Interpret and use mathematical information presented in written or visual form, including infographics, schedules, tables, timetables, calendars and charts | Interpreting infographics, schedules, tables, timetables, calendars, charts can all be linked to daily, weekly, monthly and annual planning in careers and work-related experiences. |
| 1.7.2 | Create plans and schedules | Learners could create a schedule for a list of daily and weekly tasks and think about time management, deadlines and forward planning. |
| 2.1.13 | Factorise linear or quadratic expressions that have at least one common factor | Algebraic factorisation requires careful organisation and planning where learners must first recognise the type of factorisation required. This initial step involves thinking ahead and choosing the correct method based on the structure of the algebraic expression. Learners often need to organise the expression so that common factors or relationships are easier to identify. |

{91}------------------------------------------------

For more complex expressions, such as those involving higher powers or multiple variables, learners must carefully plan their sequence of steps, this may involve rearranging formulae and applying multiple factorisation techniques in a logical order.

Key personal and social skills such as independence**,** emotional intelligence**,** discussion**,** debate, learning through mistakes and identifying areas for improvement can be cultivated when teaching GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy.

#### Personal Effectiveness

These skills can be developed through thoughtful teaching strategies, such as problem solving activities, growth mindset tasks that emphasise the importance of effort, persistence and learning through mistakes, learner error analysis, pair and group work, maths debates and discussions, group investigations and exploratory problems, learner led feedback, selfevaluation and goal setting.

Financial mathematics provides learners with content that is meaningful and purposeful for their future lives, teaching learners the skills to become confident and independent in managing their own personal finance.

The nature of mathematics gives learners ample opportunities to evaluate their 'errors' and see them as learning opportunities by identifying areas for improvement. As learners develop their mathematical fluency with the specification content, they will become more confident and independent in dealing with mathematical problems.

| 1.8.2 | Understand the basic principles of personal/ household finance and enterprise in order to solve problems relating to, for example: <ul><li>wages and salaries, including payslips</li><li>taxation, including income tax and National Insurance</li><li>savings and investments</li><li>loans/repayments</li><li>mortgages</li><li>appreciation/depreciation</li><li>budgeting</li><li>bank statements</li><li>utility bills</li><li>mobile phone and other bills</li><li>VAT</li><li>best buys</li><li>price comparison</li><li>finance schemes, including buying by instalments</li><li>discount/price increase</li><li>buying and selling</li><li>profit and loss</li><li>travel including foreign currencies, exchange rates and commission.</li></ul> | Learners can be given a piece of work on personal or household finance that has been answered incorrectly with common mistakes and misconceptions. For example, utility bills, where some learners have a common error of not converting from pence to pounds during their calculations leading to place value errors. Ask learners to identify whether the answers are correct/incorrect, identify where errors have been made and encourage discussion on how the answers can be corrected. Learners can provide advice and feedback on the work corrected to ensure that problems are successfully solved in the future. This helps develop a culture that mistakes are opportunities for growth and a normal part of the learning process. |

| 2.2.2 form, manipulate and solve more complex linear equations, including equations with more than one fractional term | After solving a set of fractional linear equations, teachers could provide opportunities for learners to evaluate their own work through self-assessment. Learners can review their answers, reflecting on their strengths and areas for development. Learners can identify and discuss which steps they got wrong, why the error occurred and how they could correct it in future problems. This promotes reflective thinking, independence, discussion and a culture of learning from mistakes to gain a deeper understanding. |
