Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:
•  Specification – this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to

know by the end of their course.

•  Assessment Pack – this contains the Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) i.e.: sample

exam papers and mark schemes

Command words

Learners should be made aware of:
•  what command words are
•  what each command word means
•  what each command word assesses.

Command words are the words and phrases used in assessments that tell learners how they
should answer the question or complete the task. Command words direct the learner through
the question or task and indicate the nature of the response required.

4.  Find the total cost of the fence panels needed for Mr Singh’s garden.

Command

Mark Schemes

Mark schemes and/or assessment criteria test the intended learning outcomes for a
component. They describe the knowledge and skills (and possibly attitude) that a candidate
is expected to demonstrate in their responses and they are then used in marking the work.

Summary of changes

There are topics from the 2015 specifications that have been removed for this qualification.

The main topics are:
•

interpreting and applying the transformation of functions in the context of their graphical
representation, including y = f(x + a), y = f(kx), y = kf(x) and y = f(x) + a, applied to  y =
f(x)

•  constructing using a ruler and a pair of compasses
•  solving problems in the context of tiling patterns and tessellation
•  distinguishing between formulae for length, area and volume by considering dimensions
•  describing translations using column vectors
•  drawing and interpreting graphs of y = ax + b + a/x and y = kx for integer values of x and

simple positive values of k.

In addition to these, the following changes are also being introduced:
•

the focus of teaching and learning will be on interpreting and using rather than drawing,
in topics including nets, plans and elevations, and box and whisker diagrams

•  all metric-imperial conversions will be given in question, so candidates will no longer be

required to memorise some of these conversion factors.

Some topics in the specification have been extended from what was made explicit in the
2015 specifications. For example:
•  solving quadratics and cubics graphically (section 2.4.10 of the specification)
•  double inequalities (section 2.2.4 of the specification)
•

the use of dotted lines in inequalities and regions questions (section 2.4.5 of the
specification)

Please see the entries in the next section of this guidance for more information about
specific topics.

Teacher Guidance

The examples provided in this document are intended to support teaching and learning by illustrating key concepts, strategies, or extreme
cases. While they help to clarify the specification, they are not necessarily indicative of the types of questions that will necessarily appear in
exams. These examples are meant to enhance understanding, and although similar questions could be asked in exams, there is no guarantee
that they will. This guidance serves as a teaching tool and should not be used as a definitive guide to future exam content.

For example:
•  Substituting a solution of an equation into the original equation to check that it is correct.
Note, it is important to check solutions in both equations when solving simultaneous
equations.

•  Reverse procedures, such as expansion of expressions to check factorisation.
•  Checking the original quantity given the result of a proportional change (reverse

In addition to non-calculator strategies, it is important to check solutions when a
calculator is allowed.

1.1.9

estimate solutions to numerical
calculations by approximating
the numbers in the calculations

When estimating, learners should round to values so that calculations can be easily done
mentally. Different strategies may be more appropriate, depending on the calculation, e.g.
1 significant figure:
•  23 × 47  [20 × 50 = 1000]

  

•  71 ÷ 19  [70 ÷ 20 = 3.5]

•

 = 12]

In some questions, learners should round numbers to a greater degree of accuracy than 1
significant figure. For example:
•  Estimate 14 500 as a percentage of 19 000.

An answer of 75% (using 15 000 and 20 000) is a more appropriate estimate than 50%
(using 10 000 and 20 000).

Other methods involving common factors, square numbers, etc.:

1.2 Number properties including prime factor decomposition

•  To estimate √52, using √49 may be more appropriate than √50.

In examinations, common number properties can either be directly assessed (e.g. selecting
numbers to fit given properties) or assessed indirectly, through assumed prior knowledge
within other questions.
Algebra could be used to explain or prove number properties.
For example:
•  n represents a whole number. Is 2n + 3 odd or even?
•  Explain why every term of the sequence 4n + 2 is an even number.
•  For all integers, n, is 5n – 3 odd, even, or sometimes odd and sometimes even?
•  Show that 3(2n + 3) – (2n + 7) is even for all integers, n. (Higher tier only.)

For example:
•  Write the reciprocal of 4 as a decimal.
•  Write the reciprocal of 3 as a fraction.

Formal knowledge of bounds is not needed.

For example:
A length is 7cm, correct to the nearest centimetre.
Could the length be 7.2 cm?

Understanding for example that the upper bound for 7 cm to the nearest cm is 7.5 cm as
opposed to 7.4 cm or 7.49 cm.
Note that whilst 7.49̇  is technically the largest number that 7 could be, and will be accepted in
examination questions, in a practical sense, this number is effectively the same as 7.5. So,
we expect learners to use 7.5, as it’s an easier number to calculate with.

•  Dafydd is going on holiday for a week. He plans to rent a car from a company that

charges £75 a week plus 50p for each mile travelled. Dafydd has a budget of £200 to
pay for the car rental.
Form an inequality and solve it to find the maximum number of miles Dafydd can
travel and still keep within his £200 budget.
75 + 0.5m ≤ 200 (leading to: m ≤ 250)
Maximum number of miles is 250.

Note that when forming and solving an inequality is required, full credit will not be
awarded for a correct solution by trial and improvement.

draw ‘by eye’ a line of ‘best fit’ and understand
and interpret what this represents. In questions
where the mean point has been given,
calculated or plotted, candidates will be
expected to draw the line of ‘best fit’ through
that point

For example:
A scatter graph shows marks of 10 students in two tests, chemistry and
physics.
The mean chemistry mark is 52. The total of all the physics marks is 560.
Plot the mean point and use this point to draw a line of best fit.

U1  U2  U3

  

If the line of best fit is expected to go through the mean point, a tighter
tolerance will apply for the position of the line.

The line of best fit should be drawn with a ruler and follow the general trend of
the data points. The line should roughly pass through the middle of all the
points, with some points above the line and some points below. The length of
the line must be at least the distance from the first to last point on the diagram.

Learners will be expected to make predictions from the line of best fit, but also
realise when it is not appropriate to do so. They should also be aware that
some points may not follow the same pattern as the rest.

Examination questions could ask for the type of correlation, and some
questions could ask to explain what the correlation means in the context of the
question.
If an explanation is asked for, then explicit reference must be made to the
variables in the question. Responses such as ‘as one goes up and so does the

The median time is the 18th value, which is in the group 54 < t < 58
seconds.
The 18th value is (18 – 4) / 16 of the way up from 54.

= 14/16 of the way up from the lower bound of the group.

(Note that the ‘4’ in the calculation is the total frequency
of all groups lower than the group the median is in.)

Therefore, the estimate of the median value is 54 + (14/16) x 4 = 57.5.

Note that the calculation is similar when we use the 18.5th person, which is
strictly more correct. The median then is 57.625. However, as we’re estimating
the median, and there isn’t a significant difference between the two answers,
particularly when the total frequency is large, using 18 is easier and is
acceptable in examination questions.

Note that the data could be presented in a histogram instead of in a grouped
frequency table.

Learners should understand when one or more of the mean, median or mode
is not an appropriate measure of central tendency.

For example, the mean may not be an appropriate measure if the data is
skewed and/or the data has one or more outliers.

Learners are not expected to know the meaning of the words ‘skew’ and
‘outlier’.

Box-and-whisker diagrams show summary statistics and are an alternative
representation to cumulative frequency graphs.

Learners will need to be able to compare two or more box-and-whisker
diagrams or one data set represented by a box-and-whisker diagram and one

Note that learners need to understand the formula for independent events at
foundation tier. On foundation tier, it is used in simple tree diagram questions,
but also in questions that do not involve tree diagrams.

For example:
Two unbiased 6-sided dice are rolled at the same time.
Calculate the probability that:
(a) both dice land on a six
(b) the first dice lands on a 3 and the second dice lands on a 5.

Note that in the above example, asking for the probability that ‘one dice lands
on a 3 and the other dice lands on a 5’ would be too demanding for foundation
tier, as it involves different permutations. However, it could be asked at
foundation tier if the question was set up using a tree diagram or a sample
space diagram, such as a two-way table of outcomes.

Examples could include identifying outcomes for up to 3 events as follows:
•  different combinations of starter, main course and dessert
•  a tree diagram with three sets of branches
•  a Venn Diagram with 3 sets.

Note that at foundation tier, examination questions on tree diagrams will be
relatively simple. We will not expect candidates to find P(B) when P(A) × P(B)
is known, and we will not expect candidates to calculate complicated additions

Learning Experiences

Learners should be encouraged to consider the following learning experiences and skills to further develop their understanding, appreciation
and awareness of the subject content. Information in the table below provides opportunities for teachers to integrate the learning experiences
into delivery.

Learning Experience

1.  Develop their

integral skills and
cross-curricular
skills in literacy and
digital competency

2.  Work both

independently and
collaboratively

Exemplification of Learning Experience

Exemplification of this learning experience can be found in the opportunities for embedding elements of the
Curriculum for Wales section found later in this guidance.

The ability to work independently is crucial to all learners tracking their own progress through this specification.
Independent work encourages learners to take ownership of their own studies, leading to a better understanding
and retention of mathematical concepts. Habits formed during GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy can ease
transition to further and higher education, where self-directed study is crucial. Equally, mathematics is a subject in
which collaborative discussion of solutions, misconceptions and approaches is hugely impactful on progress. Both
independent and collaborative learning are imperative in supporting the development of learners’ mathematical
fluency, conceptual understanding, logical reasoning, strategic competence and communication with symbols.

Problem style questions which require multiple steps to solve are effective in promoting collaborative learning.
Learners can work in groups to discuss strategies, divide tasks, and come up with solutions together.

Examples

2.4.2
Draw, interpret, recognise and
sketch the graphs of x=a, y=b,
y=ax+b

3.8.5
Describe/draw a reflection in a
given line

A useful approach to independent learning is to provide learners with the tools
they need to complete a ‘prep’ style activity, aimed at securing a sound
knowledge of the building blocks needed to access a lesson in the future. For
example, learners could be tasked with completing an independent learning
activity on identifying the equations of horizontal and vertical lines (2.4.2) in
advance of a lesson on transformations (3.8.5).

limitations of the data
available.

There are opportunities in 4.1.2 to independently plan and test a hypothesis.
Learners could use their own area of interest to devise a hypothesis and
questionnaire. Collaboratively, they can trial and criticise each other’s questions,
testing them for fairness and bias, and developing their conceptual
understanding.

Making links and showing the usefulness of mathematics in other subject areas is an invaluable tool when adding
substance and relevance to a topic or task.

Examples

1.4.6
Express one number as a
fraction or percentage of
another

Learners could use recent census data to compare and contrast. For example,
learners could find and summarise data such as the percentages of the
population in manufacturing in mathematics, whilst drawing conclusions in
geography lessons about the changes in Wales’ employment/job structure and
suggesting possible reasons why this has happened.

3.5.8
Recall and use compound
measures for speed and fuel
consumption Units include:
m/s, km/h, mph and mpg

Learners could use data from a sports day or a series of physical education
lessons to measure distances and calculate average speed using compound
measures (3.5). Using this data and their findings, they could then analyse
performance and make predictions. This task not only promotes healthy living
but also demonstrates how mathematics is intertwined with everyday activities.

3.8.3
Draw lines of symmetry on a
shape

Learners could explore concepts like symmetry and rotational symmetry (3.8)
whilst undertaking a geometric art project. They could use rulers, compasses
and protractors to draw precise shapes and patterns (3.2).

resilience and require
Learners to be resourceful

Guidance for Teaching GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy  67

Insight into the use of mathematics ‘post school’ can engage and inspire learners to pursue the subject
further. Talks from famous mathematicians, local universities, careers advisors, and local parents and
businesses who have had successful careers using mathematics can be very useful. This area is discussed
in the opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales section of this guidance.

Deeper understanding of a mathematics concept is aided through rich tasks that invoke curiosity,
encouraging inquisitive learners to consider ‘What if?’

Examples

4.3.10
Understand and use the
expected number of
successes of an event

Learners could use the internet to research and present the best option of
mobile phone plan given a certain desired criteria for an individual which could
include:
•  minutes/texts/data required
•  strength of signal in geographic location
•  additional benefits.

The area of personal finance and enterprise could be linked to probability by
developing a game for attendees to a local fair or fete. Calculating a theoretical
probability and refining the expected money raised whilst considering the
popularity of the game could be a classroom activity that builds resilience and
curiosity.

discussion over limits in accuracy.

This task could be developed to calculate averages and ranges to compare
distributions.

Learners could use measuring tools, ropes and stakes to construct various
geometric shapes and structures. In this task learners would collaborate to
create polygons or three-dimensional structures like pyramids or tetrahedrons.

Learners could explore local architecture to study symmetry, shape, and angles.
They could undertake a nature walk to learn about geometry and measurement.
For example, using trigonometry to estimate the height of trees or using a cm
square grid to estimate the area of a leaf.

7.  Access digital

technologies to
enhance digital
understanding and
strengthen
mathematical and
numeracy skills

Digital technologies are incredibly effective in providing speed and clarity for a variety of visual representations in
mathematics, thereby improving engagement in lessons and strengthening numeracy skills.

Learners could use video editing software to develop topic guides for their peers/younger year groups. Planning
and developing effective resources, they would work in groups to teach and explain a key concept/method to a
learner in key stage three. These videos could be edited and uploaded as a learning tool.

Further examples of this nature are in the digital competence area of the opportunities for embedding elements
of the Curriculum for Wales section in this guidance.

Example

2.2
Equations and inequalities –
algebraic methods

Graphing software could be used to develop fluency and a deeper
understanding of the connections between algebra and geometry when
exploring the visuality of finding the roots of a quadratic equation.

8.  Encounter familiar,
unfamiliar and
complex problems

Due to the nature of the subject area, learners will encounter mathematical challenges throughout the
specification. Opportunities to learn from errors and mistakes, overcome misconceptions, and solve
mathematical problems in a range of real-life authentic contexts are pivotal to their progress.

Learners need to have the opportunity to investigate how to solve problems, in new and varied contexts, and
discuss, questions and generate their own ideas or alternative strategies on how to solve them.

In mathematics lessons, this can be achieved through blending different areas of mathematics into the same
task.

Example

Cross-cutting themes

The specification for teaching GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy provides rich opportunities to connect learners to
local, national and international contexts, enhancing both their understanding and application of mathematical
concepts.

Teachers can draw on local real-life information that is relevant and relatable to their learners, such an analysing
community data, house prices, traffic patterns, population demographics and budgeting for local projects. National

between cities, understanding the scale and how to calculate
real distances using scale factors. For example, if a map has a
scale of 1:50,000, learners can calculate the actual distance
between two towns/cities. Learners could calculate the bearing
from London to Cardiff, helping them grasp the concept of
direction over larger distances.

Global maps introduce learners to distance calculations
between countries or major cities. This can lead to discussions
about international travel and geography.

Learners can carry out calculations in different time zones and
compare international times with their local time. Learners can
carry out calculations to explore the impact times zones have
on international business connections.

Integrating sustainability into teaching GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy will enrich mathematical learning and
provide learners with the skills and knowledge to tackle real-world issues and develop a deeper understanding of
both mathematics and sustainability. It will allow learners to enhance their analytical skills and foster a sense of
responsibility for the environment.

Sustainability can be explored when contextualising the teaching of a range of mathematical topics. Learners can
calculate costs and analyse data on topics such as climate change, population growth, energy consumption,
renewable energy, waste and recycling, carbon footprint and environmental health. Learners can read, interpret and
analyse graphs and charts, examine trends of data and make predictions on the impact of sustainable topics. When

Incorporating Careers and Work-Related Experiences into the teaching of GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy can help
learners see the relevance of mathematical concepts in various professional fields and prepare them for future career
paths.

When teaching topics such as calculating salaries and foreign currency, they can be set in real-life scenarios and linked to
a wide range of careers including careers abroad. Understanding the financial issues related to preparing for a career, by
considering factors such as university costs and student loans, can develop learners’ understanding of the financial
commitments for future career goals.

Time keeping and time management can be linked to the working day and the interpretation of schedules, timetables and
charts can support learners’ understanding of time management for future career pathways such as office work, medical
professions, teaching and shift work.

Learners will study how to collect, read, interpret and analyse data which are valuable skills for future careers such as in
data, statistical and financial analysts. Studying topics such as probability will help prepare learners for future careers such
as an actuary, statistician, data scientist, risk analyst and market research analyst.

Learners can use algebraic formulae to explore how doctors and
nurses calculate medication doses based on a patient’s mass.

Learners can solve problems using scale diagrams, time, money
and geometry, and link these to architecture, engineering,
construction and design. Learners could explore how architects
use mathematical concepts to design buildings, produce scale
drawings, project cost analysis and project timelines.

Clinometers can be used in teaching for learners to apply
trigonometry to real objects, for example they could calculate the
height of their own school building, local community architecture
and other local buildings. Learners can calculate roof angles and
beam lengths and ensure there are right angles in walls and floors
(Pythagoras proof). This will allow learners to link mathematical
concepts and see their importance in ensuring buildings are
structurally sound.

Cross-curricular Skills – Literacy

Listening skills are crucial in mathematics lessons and are intrinsically linked to progress. When teachers give
instructions for activities and explain methods, learners need to listen carefully to understand what is expected
of them and to grasp the explanations effectively. Learners also benefit through listening to their peers’ ideas
and arguments. This helps them build on others’ thoughts, ask relevant questions and contribute meaningfully to
classroom discussion. Listening effectively to a teacher’s feedback is also crucial so that learners can close a
gap in understanding, be aware of their strengths and to identify their areas of development. Good listening
skills improve the ability to communicate effectively in both personal and professional settings. These skills will
continue to benefit learners when they leave school, allowing them to understand others more effectively, to
respond appropriately and to build stronger relationships.

Think-pair-share activities are useful in developing a learner’s
listening skills, and this concept lends itself perfectly to that type
of task. Learners could be presented with two contradictory
arguments, both supported by data shown on a graph. Learners
would then listen to each other before presenting their own
argument and eventually discovering how some graphs can be
misleading.

Listening skills are important when discovering circle theorems,
particularly the very distinct vocabulary associated with the topic.
A useful starter activity would be to discuss with a partner how to
correctly label parts of a circle. Online software is a useful tool for
exploring and discovering circle theorems. Working in pairs,
learners could investigate and listen to each other’s findings
before formalising the rules.

Reading skills are very important and have a significant impact on learner achievement in mathematics lessons.
Firstly, the ability to read and understand a variety of mathematical vocabulary can be fundamental to a
learner’s success. For example, words like product, difference, volume and base can be confusing without
proper context. Learners need to be able to interpret worded questions, scan questions for key information, and
infer and deduce the best approach to answering a question.

Fostering strong reading skills in mathematics lessons not only aids in comprehension but also enhances critical
thinking and problem-solving abilities. These skills are essential in many professions and can foster a habit of
continuous learning. In everyday life, learners will often need to be able to read information from a variety of
sources including tables and graphs for example, to organise a schedule or plan a trip.

The specification content enables learners to verbally present their thoughts, strategies, reasoning and
justifications to peers and teachers using subject specific language, in a classroom environment. When learners
articulate their mathematical thinking, their depth of knowledge expands. Discussing both their problems and
solutions helps learners clarify their thoughts and identify any misconceptions. Oracy skills can also help to
foster a collaborative learning environment. Learners can work together to solve problems, share strategies and
learn from each other. Throughout life, the ability to speak effectively will improve a learners’ ability to participate
in discussions, ask questions and seek feedback. Strong oracy skills improve the ability to communicate
effectively in various settings, from personal relationships to professional environments. Speaking skills allow
learners explore and debate different perspectives, understand the consequences of actions and make
informed, ethical choices.

Writing skills play a crucial role in mathematics lessons, helping learners to articulate their understanding and
thought processes. This is evident when they solve problems and write their steps to reach the solution. In
worded questions, learners demonstrate their understanding through their written work using the correct
vocabulary and units, but also by communicating effectively and organising their work sensibly. These skills
assessed formally in questions that award marks for organising, communicating and writing accurately (OCW).
These are lifelong skills; writing is fundamental to effective communication which is crucial in both personal and
professional settings.

Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy

Central to the specification is an ambition to develop learners into efficient, fluent mathematicians who can apply
their skills in unfamiliar contexts across the curriculum and in many different real-life situations. Numeracy skills
are at the core of the specification and as such, amplifications and examples are evident throughout. AO3 also
requires learners to demonstrate strategic competence, which contributes to 20% of the assessment.
Mathematical proficiency is crucial in life outside the classroom and life after school, having fluency and
accuracy in calculations is important regardless of the path a learner decides to take. The structured approach

Critical Thinking and Problem Solving are skills that can be developed and enhanced through the teaching and learning of
GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy. This can be achieved by offering opportunities for learners to engage in numerical
reasoning, logical reasoning, justifications, proof of relationships, critical thinking and problem solving.

Learners have opportunities to investigate how to solve problems, in new, varied and real-life contexts, and discuss,
question, and generate their own ideas or alternative strategies on how to solve them. These skills can be applied to all
areas of mathematics outlined in the specification. Real-life problems require learners to apply mathematical concepts to
practical scenarios, often with no obvious starting point. Learners have to think critically about the methods they choose to
solve problems.

Many GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy problems require learners to use multiple steps or combine various mathematical
concepts to reach a solution. This builds problem-solving resilience and encourages logical reasoning as learners break
down complex problems into manageable parts.

Solving a worded simultaneous equation requires learners to first
identify that simultaneous equations are the mathematical concept
that needs to be applied, then set up the equations from the problem
and subsequently use an algebraic method to solve the equations and
find the unknown variables. They must think critically about how to
simplify and manipulate the equations effectively.

Questions on circle theorems require critical thinking and problem-
solving to break down complex problems and to recognise patterns
and relationships. Learners will need to apply multiple theorems in a
logical sequence. They will need to make decisions on relationships
and facts such as whether specific lines are equal in length or whether
certain points lie on the circumference. Some problems may require
learners to draw additional lines and think creatively about how to
modify the diagram to unlock solutions.

Planning and Organisation are essential skills that can be developed through the teaching of GCSE Mathematics and
Numeracy. These skills enable learners to approach problems systematically. Integrating opportunities for planning and
organisation into lessons, teachers can help learners become more independent and efficient.

Encouraging learners to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps and plan their approach before
solving them will develop their planning and organisational skills. When tackling a complex question, learners can first write
down a plan outlining the steps they will take, the theorems or methods they will apply, and the order in which they will
proceed. This builds on their ability to organise their thoughts and systematically work through problems. Learners need to
know how to organise their work clearly, showing all steps of their calculations or reasoning to avoid careless mistakes.

Through learning how to interpret timetables, charts, calendars and schedules, and create plans and schedules learners are
supported to develop their own planning and organisation skills.

For more complex expressions, such as those involving higher powers
or multiple variables, learners must carefully plan their sequence of
steps, this may involve rearranging formulae and applying multiple
factorisation techniques in a logical order.

Key personal and social skills such as independence, emotional intelligence, discussion, debate, learning through mistakes
and identifying areas for improvement can be cultivated when teaching GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy.

Personal
Effectiveness

These skills can be developed through thoughtful teaching strategies, such as problem solving activities, growth mindset
tasks that emphasise the importance of effort, persistence and learning through mistakes, learner error analysis, pair and
group work, maths debates and discussions, group investigations and exploratory problems, learner led feedback, self-
evaluation and goal setting.

Financial mathematics provides learners with content that is meaningful and purposeful for their future lives, teaching
learners the skills to become confident and independent in managing their own personal finance.

The nature of mathematics gives learners ample opportunities to evaluate their ‘errors’ and see them as learning
