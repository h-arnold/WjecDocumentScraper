# Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:

- Specification this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to know by the end of their course.
- Assessment Pack this contains the Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) i.e.: sample exam papers and mark schemes

<span id="page-9-1"></span>

# Command words

Learners should be made aware of:

- what command words are
- what each command word means
- what each command word assesses.

Command words are the words and phrases used in assessments that tell learners how they should answer the question or complete the task. Command words direct the learner through the question or task and indicate the nature of the response required.

<span id="page-9-2"></span>

# Mark Schemes

Mark schemes and/or assessment criteria test the intended learning outcomes for a component. They describe the knowledge and skills (and possibly attitude) that a candidate is expected to demonstrate in their responses and they are then used in marking the work.

# Objective based mark scheme:

For very short answer questions requiring one correct response.

# Summary of changes

There are topics from the 2015 specifications that have been removed for this qualification.

# The main topics are:

- interpreting and applying the transformation of functions in the context of their graphical representation, including y = f(x + a), y = f(kx), y = kf(x) and y = f(x) + a, applied to y = f(x)
- constructing using a ruler and a pair of compasses
- solving problems in the context of tiling patterns and tessellation
- distinguishing between formulae for length, area and volume by considering dimensions
- describing translations using column vectors
- drawing and interpreting graphs of y = ax + b + a/x and y = k<sup>x</sup> for integer values of x and simple positive values of k.

In addition to these, the following changes are also being introduced:

- the focus of teaching and learning will be on interpreting and using rather than drawing, in topics including nets, plans and elevations, and box and whisker diagrams
- all metric-imperial conversions will be given in question, so candidates will no longer be required to memorise some of these conversion factors.

Some topics in the specification have been extended from what was made explicit in the 2015 specifications. For example:

- solving quadratics and cubics graphically (section 2.4.10 of the specification)
- double inequalities (section 2.2.4 of the specification)
- the use of dotted lines in inequalities and regions questions (section 2.4.5 of the specification)

Please see the entries in the next section of this guidance for more information about specific topics.

# Teacher Guidance

The examples provided in this document are intended to support teaching and learning by illustrating key concepts, strategies, or extreme cases. While they help to clarify the specification, they are not necessarily indicative of the types of questions that will necessarily appear in exams. These examples are meant to enhance understanding, and although similar questions could be asked in exams, there is no guarantee that they will. This guidance serves as a teaching tool and should not be used as a definitive guide to future exam content.

Students should have a basic understanding of repayment mortgages and be able to<br>compare mortgage products or determine the required deposit amount. For more in-depth<br>questions, such as calculating monthly payments, loan amounts needed for a specific<br>monthly payment or the remaining balance on a loan, all necessary information will be<br>provided within the questions.<br>At foundation tier, working with percentages and an understanding of how to use simple<br>formulae will be required. Complicated calculations, contexts or formulae will increase the<br>difficulty of questions and could result in them being assessed at higher grades.<br>Examples of terms that learners will be expected to be aware of:<br>Profit and loss: profit, loss, costs, revenue, appreciation, depreciation.<br>Income tax: income tax, personal allowance, taxable income, basic rate, higher rate,<br>currency, National Insurance (NIC).<br>Finance schemes: overdraft, credit, debit, loan, budget, payment plan, interest, mortgage,<br>personal loan, repayments, lump sum, instalment, initial payment, insurance (e.g. house<br>insurance), crowdfunding.<br>Bills: direct debit, utility bills, meter readings, VAT, mobile phone bills, contracts, airtime,<br>monthly payments, standing charge, kilowatt-hours. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | ✓                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                      |                        |                        |                        |    |   |

|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 2.3.5 | Find the nth term of a sequence, given numerically or diagrammatically, where the rule is quadratic. The nth term must be expressed in its simplest form. For example: • $n^2 + 2$ • $n^2 + 5n - 1$ • $3n^2 - 1$. Note that nth term expressions will be of the form $n^2 + an + b$ or $cn^2 + d$, where $a$, $b$ or $d$ could be 0. |  | ✓ |  |

### 2.4 Coordinates, linear and non-linear graphs
Learners should be able to:

| Strand | Teacher Guidance | U1 | U2 | U3 |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 2.4.1 | Use coordinates in 4 quadrants. |  | ✓ |  |
| 2.4.2 | Draw, interpret, recognise and sketch the graphs of $x = a$, $y = b$, $y = ax + b$. |  | ✓ |  |
| 2.4.3 | Know and use the form $y = mx + c$ to represent a straight line where $m$ is the gradient and $c$ the y‑intercept. |  | ✓ |  |
| 2.4.4 | Draw and interpret quadratic graphs of the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, and draw the line $y = k$ to solve $ax^2 + bx + c = k$. Example: draw $y=2x^2+5x-4$, draw $y=5$, state x-values where they intersect. (Higher tier example: use the graph to solve $2x^2+5x-7=0$.) |  | ✓ |  |
| 2.4.5 | Use straight line graphs to locate regions given by inequalities. |  | ✓ |  |
| 2.4.6 | Identify the equations of lines parallel or perpendicular to a given line. Example: $y=3x+7$ is parallel to $2y=6x-5$ and perpendicular to $y=-\tfrac{1}{3}x+12$. |  | ✓ |  |
| 2.4.7 | Form, manipulate and solve two simultaneous linear equations with whole number coefficients by graphical methods. |  | ✓ |  |
| 2.4.8 | Draw, interpret and sketch graphs of $y = ax^2 + b$, $y = (ax + b)(cx + d)$, $y = a/x$, $y = ax^3$. Sketch requires correct shape/orientation and key points. |  | ✓ |  |
| 2.4.9 | Draw and interpret graphs of $y = ax^3 + b$ and $y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$. Use a smooth curve (no ruler lines between same-height points). |  | ✓ |  |
| 2.4.10 | Use a graphical method to solve $ax^2 + bx + c = dx + e$ and $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = ex + f$. Example: use graphs of $y=3x^2+9x-3$ and $y=4x+5$ to solve related equations. |  | ✓ |  |
| 2.4.11 | Draw and interpret graphs when y is given implicitly in terms of x. Examples: draw lines $x+y=7$, $2x+y=5$; show parallelism or identify regions. |  |  |  |

### 2.5 Real-life graphs
Learners should be able to:

| Strand | Teacher Guidance | U1 | U2 | U3 |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 2.5.1 | Draw and interpret conversion graphs, travel graphs and other graphs describing real-life situations. | ✓ |  |  |
| 2.5.2 | Interpret graphical representation used in the media, recognising that some graphs may be misleading (see section 1.7.1 on infographics). | ✓ |  |  |
| 2.5.3 | Construct and use tangents to curves to estimate rates of change for non-linear functions; use compound measures to express results (e.g. velocity from distance‑time, acceleration from velocity‑time). |  |  | ✓ |
| 2.5.4 | Interpret the meaning of the area under a graph, including velocity‑time graphs and other practical contexts. |  |  | ✓ |
| 2.5.5 | Use the trapezium rule to estimate the area under a curve. Note: If the gradient is continually increasing or decreasing (e.g. quadratic), state whether the estimate is an under or overestimate. |  |  | ✓ |

In questions where the mean point has been given, calculated or plotted, candidates will be expected to draw the line of 'best fit' through that point |  | For example:<br>A scatter graph shows marks of 10 students in two tests, chemistry and physics.<br>The mean chemistry mark is 52. The total of all the physics marks is 560.<br>Plot the mean point and use this point to draw a line of best fit.<br>If the line of best fit is expected to go through the mean point, a tighter tolerance will apply for the position of the line.<br>The line of best fit should be drawn with a ruler and follow the general trend of the data points. The line should roughly pass through the middle of all the points, with some points above the line and some points below. The length of the line must be at least the distance from the first to last point on the diagram.<br>Learners will be expected to make predictions from the line of best fit, but also realise when it is not appropriate to do so. They should also be aware that some points may not follow the same pattern as the rest. |  |    |    |   |

However, it could be asked at foundation tier if the question was set up using a tree diagram or a sample space diagram, such as a two-way table of outcomes. | $$ |

We will not expect candidates to find P(B) when P(A) × P(B) is known, and we will not expect candidates to calculate complicated additions of probabilities, e.g. in tree diagrams with three sets of branches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | $$ |

Digital technologies are incredibly effective in providing speed and clarity for a variety of visual representations in mathematics, thereby improving engagement in lessons and strengthening numeracy skills.

Learners could use video editing software to develop topic guides for their peers/younger year groups. Planning and developing effective resources, they would work in groups to teach and explain a key concept/method to a learner in key stage three. These videos could be edited and uploaded as a learning tool.

Further examples of this nature are in the digital competence area of the opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales section in this guidance.

# Example

2.2 Equations and inequalities – algebraic methods

Graphing software could be used to develop fluency and a deeper understanding of the connections between algebra and geometry when exploring the visuality of finding the roots of a quadratic equation.

8. Encounter familiar, unfamiliar and complex problems

Due to the nature of the subject area, learners will encounter mathematical challenges throughout the specification. Opportunities to learn from errors and mistakes, overcome misconceptions, and solve mathematical problems in a range of real-life authentic contexts are pivotal to their progress.

Learners need to have the opportunity to investigate how to solve problems, in new and varied contexts, and discuss, questions and generate their own ideas or alternative strategies on how to solve them.

In mathematics lessons, this can be achieved through blending different areas of mathematics into the same task.

# Example

2.2

Equations and inequalities – algebraic methods

Learners could use algebra to form and solve an equation which is then used to find the area of a compound shape.

# Opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales

# Cross-cutting themes

The specification for teaching GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy provides rich opportunities to connect learners to local, national and international contexts, enhancing both their understanding and application of mathematical concepts.

Teachers can draw on local real-life information that is relevant and relatable to their learners, such an analysing community data, house prices, traffic patterns, population demographics and budgeting for local projects. National and international contexts can be explored by linking mathematical content to locations, maps, landmarks, architecture, travel, medicine, computing, health, demographics, economy, finance and climate.

# Cross-curricular Skills – Literacy

Listening skills are crucial in mathematics lessons and are intrinsically linked to progress. When teachers give instructions for activities and explain methods, learners need to listen carefully to understand what is expected of them and to grasp the explanations effectively. Learners also benefit through listening to their peers' ideas and arguments. This helps them build on others' thoughts, ask relevant questions and contribute meaningfully to classroom discussion. Listening effectively to a teacher's feedback is also crucial so that learners can close a gap in understanding, be aware of their strengths and to identify their areas of development. Good listening skills improve the ability to communicate effectively in both personal and professional settings. These skills will continue to benefit learners when they leave school, allowing them to understand others more effectively, to respond appropriately and to build stronger relationships.

Reading skills are very important and have a significant impact on learner achievement in mathematics lessons. Firstly, the ability to read and understand a variety of mathematical vocabulary can be fundamental to a learner's success. For example, words like product, difference, volume and base can be confusing without proper context. Learners need to be able to interpret worded questions, scan questions for key information, and infer and deduce the best approach to answering a question.

Fostering strong reading skills in mathematics lessons not only aids in comprehension but also enhances critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. These skills are essential in many professions and can foster a habit of continuous learning. In everyday life, learners will often need to be able to read information from a variety of sources including tables and graphs for example, to organise a schedule or plan a trip.

The specification content enables learners to verbally present their thoughts, strategies, reasoning and justifications to peers and teachers using subject specific language, in a classroom environment. When learners articulate their mathematical thinking, their depth of knowledge expands. Discussing both their problems and solutions helps learners clarify their thoughts and identify any misconceptions. Oracy skills can also help to foster a collaborative learning environment. Learners can work together to solve problems, share strategies and learn from each other. Throughout life, the ability to speak effectively will improve a learners' ability to participate in discussions, ask questions and seek feedback. Strong oracy skills improve the ability to communicate effectively in various settings, from personal relationships to professional environments. Speaking skills allow learners explore and debate different perspectives, understand the consequences of actions and make informed, ethical choices.

| Writing | Writing skills play a crucial role in mathematics lessons, helping learners to articulate their understanding and thought processes. This is evident when they solve problems and write their steps to reach the solution. In worded questions, learners demonstrate their understanding through their written work using the correct vocabulary and units, but also by communicating effectively and organising their work sensibly. These skills assessed formally in questions that award marks for organising, communicating and writing accurately (OCW).

# Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy

Central to the specification is an ambition to develop learners into efficient, fluent mathematicians who can apply their skills in unfamiliar contexts across the curriculum and in many different real-life situations. Numeracy skills are at the core of the specification and as such, amplifications and examples are evident throughout. AO3 also requires learners to demonstrate strategic competence, which contributes to 20% of the assessment. Mathematical proficiency is crucial in life outside the classroom and life after school, having fluency and accuracy in calculations is important regardless of the path a learner decides to take. The structured approach of this specification ensures that learners not only learn mathematical concepts but also understand their applications, thereby developing a well-rounded mathematical proficiency.

# Integral Skills

Integrating opportunities for learners to be creative and innovative into the teaching of GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy will enhance learners' problem-solving skills. Exploring mathematics in real-life contexts can create opportunities that foster creativity, innovation, curiosity and inquisitiveness. Learners can make links across subject disciplines and develop a depth of knowledge. Giving learners open-ended or challenging problems will allow them to think creatively, explore different strategies and develop their reasoning and communication skills. Combining multiple mathematical topic areas to create mathematical problems will encourage learners to think creatively about what they know, what they need to find out and what mathematical strategies they then need to apply in order to solve the problem.

Critical Thinking and Problem Solving are skills that can be developed and enhanced through the teaching and learning of GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy. This can be achieved by offering opportunities for learners to engage in numerical reasoning, logical reasoning, justifications, proof of relationships, critical thinking and problem solving.

Learners have opportunities to investigate how to solve problems, in new, varied and real-life contexts, and discuss, question, and generate their own ideas or alternative strategies on how to solve them. These skills can be applied to all areas of mathematics outlined in the specification. Real-life problems require learners to apply mathematical concepts to practical scenarios, often with no obvious starting point. Learners have to think critically about the methods they choose to solve problems.

Many GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy problems require learners to use multiple steps or combine various mathematical concepts to reach a solution. This builds problem-solving resilience and encourages logical reasoning as learners break down complex problems into manageable parts.

**Planning and Organisation** are essential skills that can be developed through the teaching of GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy. These skills enable learners to approach problems systematically. Integrating opportunities for planning and organisation into lessons, teachers can help learners become more independent and efficient.

Encouraging learners to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps and plan their approach before solving them will develop their planning and organisational skills. When tackling a complex question, learners can first write down a plan outlining the steps they will take, the theorems or methods they will apply, and the order in which they will proceed. This builds on their ability to organise their thoughts and systematically work through problems. Learners need to know how to organise their work clearly, showing all steps of their calculations or reasoning to avoid careless mistakes.

Through learning how to interpret timetables, charts, calendars and schedules, and create plans and schedules learners are supported to develop their own planning and organisation skills.

{92}------------------------------------------------

For more complex expressions, such as those involving higher powers or multiple variables, learners must carefully plan their sequence of steps, this may involve rearranging formulae and applying multiple factorisation techniques in a logical order.

Key personal and social skills such as independence**,** emotional intelligence**,** discussion**,** debate, learning through mistakes and identifying areas for improvement can be cultivated when teaching GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy.

# Personal Effectiveness

These skills can be developed through thoughtful teaching strategies, such as problem solving activities, growth mindset tasks that emphasise the importance of effort, persistence and learning through mistakes, learner error analysis, pair and group work, maths debates and discussions, group investigations and exploratory problems, learner led feedback, selfevaluation and goal setting.

Financial mathematics provides learners with content that is meaningful and purposeful for their future lives, teaching learners the skills to become confident and independent in managing their own personal finance.

The nature of mathematics gives learners ample opportunities to evaluate their 'errors' and see them as learning opportunities by identifying areas for improvement. As learners develop their mathematical fluency with the specification content, they will become more confident and independent in dealing with mathematical problems.
