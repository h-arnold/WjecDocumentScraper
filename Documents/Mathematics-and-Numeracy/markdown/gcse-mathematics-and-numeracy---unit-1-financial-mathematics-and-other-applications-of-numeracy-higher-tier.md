#### Formula List – Unit 1 Higher Tier

Area of a trapezium = 
$$\frac{1}{2}(a+b)h$$

![](_page_4_Picture_2.jpeg)

## Volume of an Object with a Uniform Cross-section (e.g. Prism, Cylinder)

Volume = area of cross section  $\times$  length

![](_page_4_Picture_5.jpeg)

Volume of a sphere =  $\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ Surface area of a sphere =  $4\pi r^2$ 

![](_page_4_Picture_7.jpeg)

Volume of a cone  $=\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h$ Curved surface area of a cone  $=\pi rl$ 

![](_page_4_Picture_9.jpeg)

#### **Annual Equivalent Rate (AER)**

AER, as a decimal, is calculated using the formula  $\left(1+\frac{i}{n}\right)^n-1$ , where i is the nominal interest rate per annum as a decimal and n is the number of compounding periods per annum.

Mr Bevan used 660 kWh of electricity during September, October and November [5] last year.
For the same 3-month period this year, he assumes his usage of electricity will not change.

Mr Bevan has the following information about electricity charges this year.

- The standing charge is £15 per month
- Electricity costs 29p per kWh

2.

• VAT at 5% is payable on the total of the standing charge and the cost of the electricity used.

| Calculate how much Mr Bevan's electricity bill will be for the 3-month period of September to November this year. |

3. Hisako bought a number of shirts to sell in her shop during the summer.

The shirts cost Hisako £14 each to buy.

| During the summer, Hisako sold each shirt at a price that was 35% more than what she paid for them. At the end of summer, Hisako puts the shirts she has left on sale. In the sale, she reduces the selling price by one fifth of the original selling price. |

Matthew will be making monthly repayments to pay back the loan in 7 years. The formula for calculating the monthly repayment on a loan is

$$M = \frac{r \times L}{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}$$

where:

- *M* is the amount of each monthly repayment
- *L* is the loan needed
- *r* is the **monthly** interest rate as a decimal
- *n* is the number of **months** taken to pay back the loan.

Diagrams not drawn to scale

All the exterior surfaces of the building, including the doors are to be painted.

The measurements on the diagram are given **correct to the nearest metre**. The paint comes in tins that cover an area of 40 m<sup>2</sup>, **correct to the nearest m<sup>2</sup>**.

### How to read the mark scheme

- 'M' marks are awarded for any correct method applied to appropriate working, even though a numerical error may be involved. Once earned they cannot be lost.
- 'm' marks are dependant method marks. They are only given if the relevant previous 'M' mark has been earned.
- 'A' marks are given for a numerically correct stage, for a correct result or for an answer lying within a specified range. They are only given if the relevant M/m mark has been earned either explicitly or by inference from the correct answer.
- 'B' marks are independent of method and are usually awarded for an accurate result or statement.
- 'S' marks are awarded for strategy
- 'E' marks are awarded for explanation
- 'U' marks are awarded for units
- 'P' marks are awarded for plotting points
- 'C' marks are awarded for drawing curves
- 'OC' marks are awarded for 'organising and communicating', a strand of OCW (organising, communicating and writing accurately)
- 'W' marks are awarded for 'writing accurately', a strand of OCW (organising, communicating and writing accurately)
- 'SC' marks are awards for special cases
- CAO: correct answer only
- ISW: ignore subsequent working
- FT: follow through
