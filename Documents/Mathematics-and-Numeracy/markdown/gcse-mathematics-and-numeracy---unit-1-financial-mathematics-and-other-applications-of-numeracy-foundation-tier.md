The sales manager wrote a report on the sales of the different sizes of shampoo bottles.

The report included the bar chart below.

![](_page_11_Figure_4.jpeg)

1. The vertical scale is misleading — the y axis does not start at 0 (and/or uses an inconsistent scale), so the medium bar’s height is exaggerated and appears more than double the small bar although the actual counts are not.

2. The large bar is drawn wider than the others (or the widths of the bars are inconsistent), so its area looks much larger; the number sold is shown by height, not by bar width/area, so it does not actually show “double” the medium.

## How to read the mark scheme

- 'M' marks are awarded for any correct method applied to appropriate working, even though a numerical error may be involved. Once earned they cannot be lost.
- 'm' marks are dependant method marks. They are only given if the relevant previous 'M' mark has been earned.
- 'A' marks are given for a numerically correct stage, for a correct result or for an answer lying within a specified range. They are only given if the relevant M/m mark has been earned either explicitly or by inference from the correct answer.
- 'B' marks are independent of method and are usually awarded for an accurate result or statement.
- 'S' marks are awarded for strategy
- 'E' marks are awarded for explanation
- 'U' marks are awarded for units
- 'P' marks are awarded for plotting points
- 'C' marks are awarded for drawing curves
- 'OC' marks are awarded for 'organising and communicating', a strand of OCW (organising, communicating and writing accurately)
- 'W' marks are awarded for 'writing accurately', a strand of OCW (organising, communicating and writing accurately)
- 'SC' marks are awards for special cases
- CAO: correct answer only
- ISW: ignore subsequent working
- FT: follow through
