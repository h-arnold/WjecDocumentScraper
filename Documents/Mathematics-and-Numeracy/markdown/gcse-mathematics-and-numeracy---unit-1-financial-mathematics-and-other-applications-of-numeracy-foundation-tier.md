The sales manager wrote a report on the sales of the different sizes of shampoo bottles.

The report included the bar chart below.

![](_page_11_Figure_4.jpeg)

The sales manager made the following two statements:

'This graph shows that the number of medium bottles sold was more than double the number of small bottles sold, as the medium bar is more than double the height of the small bar.'

'It also looks like the number of large bottles sold was double the number of medium bottles sold.'

The sales manager's statements are incorrect.

Using the bar chart, give one explanation for each statement that has led the sales manager to make these incorrect statements.

|  |  | 'Most pupils in Year 11 spend less than 21 /2 hours per week doing exercise.' |  |  |
|  | (a) | Part of the questionnaire they will give to pupils in Year 11 asks the following question: | [2] |  |

## How to read the mark scheme

- 'M' marks are awarded for any correct method applied to appropriate working, even though a numerical error may be involved. Once earned they cannot be lost.
- 'm' marks are dependant method marks. They are only given if the relevant previous 'M' mark has been earned.
- 'A' marks are given for a numerically correct stage, for a correct result or for an answer lying within a specified range. They are only given if the relevant M/m mark has been earned either explicitly or by inference from the correct answer.
- 'B' marks are independent of method and are usually awarded for an accurate result or statement.
- 'S' marks are awarded for strategy
- 'E' marks are awarded for explanation
- 'U' marks are awarded for units
- 'P' marks are awarded for plotting points
- 'C' marks are awarded for drawing curves
- 'OC' marks are awarded for 'organising and communicating', a strand of OCW (organising, communicating and writing accurately)
- 'W' marks are awarded for 'writing accurately', a strand of OCW (organising, communicating and writing accurately)
- 'SC' marks are awards for special cases
- CAO: correct answer only
- ISW: ignore subsequent working
- FT: follow through
