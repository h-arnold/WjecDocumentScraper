5. (a) Shampoo is sold in bottles of three different sizes: small, medium and large.

The sales manager wrote a report on the sales of the different sizes of shampoo bottles.

The report included the bar chart below.

The sales manager made the following two statements:

' This graph shows that the number of medium bottles sold was more than double the number of small bottles sold, as the medium bar is more than double the height of the small bar.'

'It also looks like the number of large bottles sold was double the number of medium bottles sold.'

The sales manager's statements are incorrect.

Using the bar chart, give one explanation for each statement that has led the sales manager to make these incorrect statements.

## How to read the mark scheme

- 'M' marks are awarded for any correct method applied to appropriate working, even though a numerical error may be involved. Once earned they cannot be lost.
- 'm' marks are dependant method marks. They are only given if the relevant previous 'M' mark has been earned.
- 'A' marks are given for a numerically correct stage, for a correct result or for an answer lying within a specified range. They are only given if the relevant M/m mark has been earned either explicitly or by inference from the correct answer.
