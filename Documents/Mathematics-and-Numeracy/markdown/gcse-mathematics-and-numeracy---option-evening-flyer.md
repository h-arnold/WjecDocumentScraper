# Core Subject Mathematics & Numeracy (Double Award)

![](_page_0_Picture_1.jpeg)

In GCSE Mathematics & Numeracy, you will build on the knowledge and understanding you have of topics within number, algebra, geometry, and data. You will be taught the key financial aspects of everyday adult life, such as dealing with payslips, bills, and savings. A good understanding of the content of this qualification is the perfect platform to those hoping to follow a STEM career.

# WHAT WILL I STUDY?

The course has 3 units:

# UNIT 1: Financial Mathematics and Other Applications of Numeracy

In this unit you will learn life lessons that will help you become a financially well-informed adult. Think about terms or acronyms you may have heard about like 'National Insurance', 'VAT' or 'AER' – these will become familiar to you. Financial opportunities and pitfalls will be addressed, and you will learn how to read important documents like payslips, bills and bank statements.

All sorts of other real-world contexts will also be taught and assessed, making this unit relevant and interesting.

## UNIT 2: Non-calculator

You will explore concepts where you won't need your calculator in this unit. You will deepen your understanding of probability and explore new ideas within algebra and geometry, like quadratic graphs and circle theorems.

# UNIT 3: Calculator-allowed

This unit has the biggest weighting of all three units, and you can have your calculator by your side. There is lots of data handling and statistics in this unit as well as new geometry concepts such as Pythagoras' Theorem and Trigonometry.
