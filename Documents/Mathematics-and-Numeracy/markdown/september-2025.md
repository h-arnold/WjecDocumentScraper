WJEC Newsletter – September 2025

# GCSE MATHEMATICS AND GCSE MATHEMATICS-NUMERACY

## PROFESSIONAL LEARNING (PL) TRAINING COURSES

Please note that, with our focus now on the new GCSE, there will be no online feedback event this year. However, resources from previous years, which include valuable feedback on topic areas that continue to present challenges for candidates, remain available on [Portal.](https://portal.wjec.co.uk/)

### PRINCIPAL EXAMINERS' REPORTS

Principal Examiners' reports are now available for the Summer 2025 series for GCSE Mathematics and GCSE Mathematics-Numeracy. They can be found under the Key Documents tab on the [legacy](https://www.wjec.co.uk/qualifications/mathematics-gcse/#tab_keydocuments)  [GCSE Mathematics webpage.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/qualifications/mathematics-gcse/#tab_keydocuments)

### FREE ACCESS TO SCRIPTS

WJEC teachers also benefit from access to free marked exam scripts from the Summer 2025 assessment series.

Candidates' scripts will be available to download from [Portal](https://portal.wjec.co.uk/) from results day onwards.

### BLENDED LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE ORGANISERS

We currently have two blended learning webpages running in parallel, one for the [legacy qualifica](https://resources-legacy.wjec.co.uk/Pages/ResourceByArgs.aspx?subId=38&lvlId=2)[tion](https://resources-legacy.wjec.co.uk/Pages/ResourceByArgs.aspx?subId=38&lvlId=2) and one for the [new qualification.](https://filter.resources.wjec.co.uk/en/s/Mathematics%20and%20Numeracy?types=KO%2CBL) While some topics overlap, it is important to ensure that students are directed to the correct resources page for the qualification they are following.

## FINAL LEGACY EXAMINATIONS

In 2025–26, only candidates in Year 11 or above will be eligible to sit the legacy papers.

In 2026–27, resit opportunities will be available for post-16 learners who have previously cashed in on the legacy qualification. These will be offered in November 2026 (GCSE Mathematics), January 2027 (GCSE Mathematics-Numeracy) and Summer 2027 (both GCSE Mathematics and GCSE Mathematics-Numeracy), subject to demand.

## NEW GCSE MATHEMATICS AND NUMERACY (DOUBLE AWARD)

## PROFESSIONAL LEARNING (PL) TRAINING COURSES

We are pleased to announce that all professional learning activities within the WJEC support package for the new GCSE are now complete. During the spring term, we delivered 12 successful face-toface training days. Materials from these sessions are now available o[n Portal.](https://portal.wjec.co.uk/)

You will also find on Portal a set of student-facing examination walkthroughs, designed to help candidates prepare for assessments. These will not be publicly available initially, so teachers will need to download and share them directly with their students.

Additionally, our [new qualification webpage](https://www.wjec.co.uk/qualifications/gcse-mathematics-and-numeracy-double-award-teaching-from-2025/#tab_keydocuments) hosts further resources. Under Training On Demand Courses, you can access the *Specification Walk-Through* and a video recording of the *Specification Briefing* held in November 2024.

### BLENDED LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE ORGANISERS

We currently have two blended learning webpages running in parallel, one for the [legacy qualifica](https://resources-legacy.wjec.co.uk/Pages/ResourceByArgs.aspx?subId=38&lvlId=2)[tion](https://resources-legacy.wjec.co.uk/Pages/ResourceByArgs.aspx?subId=38&lvlId=2) and one for the [new qualification.](https://filter.resources.wjec.co.uk/en/s/Mathematics%20and%20Numeracy?types=KO%2CBL) While some topics overlap, it is important to ensure that students are directed to the correct resources page for the qualification they are following.

### 2025-26 EXAMINATIONS

From September 2025, all students starting Year 10 must follow the new GCSE course. They will not be permitted to sit any legacy papers. Their first opportunity to take assessments will be in Summer 2026, when Units 1 and 2 will both be available. Unit 3 will be offered in November 2026, which will also be the first opportunity for students to cash in their results.

### UPDATES TO THE NEW SPECIFICATION

Please note that updated versions of certain documents have been released since their initial publication. Where applicable, a *Summary of Amendments* page has been included. As some teachers may have been working from separate spreadsheets or schemes of work, please ensure that these updates are applied across all relevant materials.

The most recent amendments were made in August 2025, including:

- 1.4.3 "Convert numbers from one form into another" added to Unit 1 and Unit 3
- 1.9.7 "Use surds in exact calculations" added to Unit 2

### • IMPORTANT

There has also been a significant change to certain Welsh-medium terminology. This concerns the Welsh-language terms for *speed* and *velocity*. Please refer to [Appendix 1](#page-4-0) for the full statement.

## <span id="page-4-0"></span>Appendix 1

Following a consultation under the guidance of Canolfan Bedwyr, which is Bangor University's Centre for Welsh Language Services, Research and Technology (who are responsible for Y Termiadur Addysg), a decision was made to change the Welsh language terminology currently in use for 'speed' and 'velocity'. An important point to make here is that Canolfan Bedwyr consulted with WJEC, mathematics and physics subject specialists, the national literacy tests specialist panel and teachers who currently teach these subjects in secondary schools.

### The problem

The central issue with the current terminology is the inconsistency which exists between:

- Language in common, everyday use:
  - The word 'cyflymder' is used for 'speed' outside school including in professional situations (such as any discussion relating to speed limits etc). 'Buanedd' is an old historical term which doesn't form part of everyday language.
- Primary education:
  - Pupils learn the term 'cyflymder' for 'speed' in primary school.
- Secondary education:
  - When they reach secondary school, pupils need to change to using 'buanedd' for 'speed' without understanding why that is. Years later, the use of 'cyflymder' for 'velocity' is introduced.
- Educational subjects:
  - 'Cyflymder' is used for 'speed' in subjects like Physical Education and Information Technology but then 'cyflymder' is also used for 'velocity' in the subjects of Physics and Mathematics.

This inconsistency confuses pupils, especially as they move from primary to secondary education or in resources or activities which encompass both periods. The recent national numeracy tests are such an example, where a decision has to be made as to which term to use, with these tests being given to primary and secondary pupils. This problem will continue despite the fact that changes will be coming to these tests over the next few years.

#### The change

- **•** To use 'cyflymder' for 'speed' across all levels of education (reconciling with common speech)
- **•** Coin the new term 'felosedd' for 'velocity'
- **•** Dispose of the term 'buanedd' as a technical term

#### Arguments for change

- **•** It would reconcile terminology across primary and secondary education
- **•** It would reconcile school terminology with common speech
- **•** It would follow modern terminology principles (that is keeping familiar words for familiar concepts)

## Implementing the change

### New GCSE/Level 2 specifications (teaching from 2025/2026)

Based on the recommendations of Canolfan Bedwyr therefore, 'cyflymder' (speed) and 'felosedd' (velocity) will be used in the following new qualifications:

- GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy (double award) specification teaching from 2025
- Level 2 Additional Mathematics specification teaching from 2026
- GCSE The Sciences (double award) teaching from 2026
- GCSE Integrated Science teaching from 2026

{5}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_5_Picture_0.jpeg)

In order to mitigate for any confusion which may be caused by this change, the English terms will be put in brackets the first time the terms appear in an examination paper.

### Current GCSE/Level 2 specifications

Please note: these changes relate to the new specifications only, there will be NO change to the terms used in the current specifications.

'Buanedd' (speed) and 'cyflymder' (velocity) will continue to be used in the following specifications:

- GCSE Mathematics/Numeracy specification (current)
- Level 2 Additional Mathematics specification (current)
- GCSE Science specifications (Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Science Double Award, Applied Science Single Award/Double Award) (current)

From 2026 onwards, the terms in English will also be placed in brackets in the examination papers of the above specifications. This is to avoid any confusion for the candidates sitting one of the current GCSE Science specifications and the new GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy specification (teaching from 2025).

## Current GCE specifications

### GCE Mathematics / Further Mathematics specifications

For now, 'buanedd' (speed) and 'cyflymder' (velocity) will continue to be used in these specifications.

However, the AS units of these specifications will be changed to align with the GCSE specification from September 2027 onwards. Then from September 2028 onwards, the A Level units of these specifications will also be changed. In fairness to all candidates sitting/resitting GCE Mathematics/Further Mathematics over the next few years, the English terms wil be placed in brackets in the examination papers from 2026 onwards.

### GCE Biology / Chemistry / Physics specifications

For now, 'buanedd' (speed) and 'cyflymder' (velocity) will continue to be used in these specifications.

However, the AS units of these specifications will be changed to align with the GCSE specification from September 2028 onwards. Then from September 2029 onwards, the A Level units of these specifications will also be changed. In fairness to all candidates sitting/resitting GCE Biology/Chemistry/Physics examination papers over the next few years, the English terms will be placed in brackets in the examination papers from 2026 onwards.

Implementing these changes will cause an additional burden initially in the short term, but we do feel that pupils will benefit from making this change in the long term in order to ensure consistency of terminology across their entire educational journey.
