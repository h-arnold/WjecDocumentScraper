INTRODUCTION

1.1  Aims

GCSE Social Studies supports learners to:
•  develop an understanding of how to become ethical, informed and responsible

citizens of Wales and the world

•  develop a greater understanding of the world and of other people and their

values

•  engage with contemporary social issues, and explore identity, rights and

democracy

•  explore social issues and consider how to actively participate and engage in

social action

•  appreciate the complex, pluralistic and diverse nature of society by understanding
identity, rights and responsibilities, equality and inequality, and how these issues
shape people, places and community
reflect on the influence of governance on people, places and community

•
•  explore the cross-cutting theme of human rights and diversity, including Black,
Asian, and minority ethnic perspectives, identity, culture and contributions.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales’ Approval Criteria.

The GCSE Social Studies qualification will be based on the following concepts:
•  authority and governance
•  cause and effect
•  change and continuity
•  citizenship
•  community
•  diversity
•
•
•
•
•
•  social action.

identity and belonging
interconnectedness
justice and equality
responsibility
rights

Therefore, Social Studies is about:
•  understanding the various dimensions under which human societies have, and
can be, understood and explained such as the personal, the local, the national,
the international

•  understanding the various social issues that exist in Wales and internationally
•  appreciating that social issues are complex and can be explained from various

perspectives

•  understanding that societies change, what causes those changes and what we
as members of society can do to promote change in our society through legal,
non-violent social action.

1.2  Curriculum for Wales

GCSE SOCIAL STUDIES 7

This GCSE Social Studies qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales
framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make
progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to
this design are the principles of progression, along with the statements of what
matters and those subject specific skills and concepts outlined in the ‘Designing your
Curriculum’ section of the Humanities Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to
embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral
skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple
mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for
Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for
integrating the learning experiences noted in ‘Opportunities for integration of learning
experiences’ on page 29; the Guidance for Teaching will include further information
on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

The GCSE Social Studies qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:
•  supporting the statements of what matters1 by encouraging learners to:

•  ask increasingly sophisticated enquiry questions
•  demonstrate greater independence in finding suitable information, making

informed predictions and hypotheses, and making judgements

•  become more able to effectively work with others, especially, but not limited

to, taking part in social action
increase their breadth and depth of knowledge and underlying concepts

•
•  develop an understanding of themselves in the world
•  demonstrate an ability to work with an increasing number and sophistication
of sources of information, and a growing understanding of how to resolve
contradictory or conflicting accounts

•  continually refine and develop a growing sophistication of key disciplinary

skills, including those relating to enquiry such as framing questions and using
evidence to construct and support an answer, and relating that to
representation and interpretation of enquiry results

•  demonstrate a growing ability to transfer existing skills and knowledge into

new, and increasingly unfamiliar contexts

•  demonstrate a greater ability to influence events by exercising informed and

responsible citizenship.

•  supporting the subject specific considerations for Social Studies2 by:
•  developing an understanding of the discipline and its value
•  encouraging conceptual understanding of the world by learning about people

and their values, in different times, places and circumstances
•  providing rich contexts to explore social issues, identity, rights and

responsibilities, and social organisation

•  encouraging active participation and engagement with social issues through

social enquiry, discussions and social action

•  developing an understanding of how systems of government in Wales operate

and affect people’s lives, and how they compare with other systems

•  exploring the concepts of governance, rights, equality, inequality, ethnicity,

gender and poverty.

1.3  Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is
designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the
conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages
3 –14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills
and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares
learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation
for the study of Government and Politics, Law, Psychology and Sociology at either
AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and
worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this
subject.

1.4  Guided learning hours

GCSE Social Studies has been designed to be delivered within 120–140 guided
learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme
for learners in years 10 and 11.

1.5  Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our
language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect
and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and
adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising
that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to
ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres
of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always
be on the website.

1.6  Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic,
religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible,
features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access
and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual
orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to
enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills
without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the
following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access
Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This
document is available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of
provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete
barrier to any part of the assessment.

3.2  Arrangements for non-examination assessment

Unit 2: Overview

 The assignment, which includes data sources and several tasks, will be issued to
centres in an Assessment Pack via the WJEC Portal in the September of the first
year. Tasks are not intended to change for the lifetime of the qualification. The social
issue will change annually. Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the year
learners undertake the assignment. However, it is important that centres use the data
sources from the year that they plan to submit the work for marking as this may be
different to the year that the candidates undertake the assessment.

This assessment contributes to 20% of the overall qualification grade and will take 6
hours 30 minutes for candidates to complete the tasks. The assignment could be
completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions. The tasks will be marked out
of a total of 60 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be set and
marked by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be
handwritten and scanned or completed digitally).

Unit 4: Overview

For this assessment learners are required to consider how they could plan for social
action on a social issue that affects a community.

The assignment, which will include a brief and several tasks will be issued to centres
in an Assessment pack via the WJEC Portal. Tasks are not intended to change for
the lifetime of the qualification. If candidates choose to resit this unit at a later date,
they must choose another social issue and social action to explore. Centres have the
flexibility to decide when, during the assessment year, learners undertake the
assignment.

This assessment contributes to 20% of the overall qualification grade and will take 6
hours and 30 minutes to complete. The assignment could be completed in one
sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions. The assignment will be marked out of a total
of 60 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be marked
by the centre and moderated by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally
(they may be handwritten and scanned or completed digitally).

4  MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's
regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in
the preparation of work for GCSE Social Studies.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our Guide to preventing, reporting and
investigating malpractice.

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC
(malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or
disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet Suspected
Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

5.1  Entries and awards

This is a unitised qualification. Learners are entered for each unit separately.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer assessment period each
year, until the end of the life of the specification.

Unit 1, Unit 2 and Unit 3 will be available in 2027 (and each year thereafter). Unit 4
will be available in 2028 (and each year thereafter) and the qualification will be
awarded for the first time in summer 2028.

Pre-16 candidates (i.e. candidates who are under 16 on 31st August in the academic
year in which they were entered)

The terminal rule is set at 40% of the overall qualification for GCSE Social Studies.

If the assessment being re-taken contributes to the 40% terminal rule requirement,
the mark for the new assessment will count regardless of previous results in that
assessment.

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score
from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade subject to the
terminal rule being satisfied first i.e. that candidates must complete a minimum
amount of the assessment for a qualification in the series in which they are cashing-
in.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the
third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s).
This is referred to as a 'fresh start'. When retaking a qualification (fresh start), a
candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from
examination units taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating the new
grade(s).

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not
count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in
the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be used for the life of the specification.

Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1st September in the
academic year in which they are entered)

There is no terminal rule that applies to Post-16 Candidates for GCSE Social
Studies.

There is no limit on the number of times a candidate can resit an individual unit;
however, the better uniform mark score from the most two recent attempts will be
used in calculating the final overall grade.

The ‘fresh start’ rule does not apply to post-16 candidates.
