INTRODUCTION

1.1  Aims

GCSE Physical Education and Health supports learners to:
•  develop their knowledge and understanding of health, wellbeing, and physical

activity and the links between them

•  understand the factors that impact on levels of activity and the relationship with

physical, social and emotional health and wellbeing through the life cycle
•  understand the socio-cultural influences on participation, and contemporary
developments within sport and physical activity, on a local, national and
international stage

•  perform effectively in different sports and physical activities by developing skills
and techniques, and selecting and using tactics, strategies and/or compositional
ideas

•  analyse physical performance and select appropriate strategies and interventions

•

for development and improvement
think critically and reflectively about their own performance and practice, and that
of others

•  explore the cross-cutting theme of human rights and diversity, including Black,
Asian and minority ethnic perspectives, identity, culture, contributions and
experiences.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales’s Approval Criteria.

1.2  Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Physical Education and Health qualification is underpinned by the
Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can
continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this
qualification. Central to this design are the principles of progression, along with the
statements of what matters and those subject specific skills and concepts outlined in
the ‘Designing your Curriculum’ section of the Health and Well-being Area of
Learning and Experiences

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to
embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral
skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix B provides a simple
mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for
Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for
integrating the learning experiences noted on page 22; the Guidance for Teaching
will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

GCSE PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND HEALTH 6

The GCSE Physical Education and Health qualification supports the Curriculum for
Wales by:

•  supporting the statements of what matters1 by giving learners the opportunity to:
•  understand the factors that affect physical health and well-being including.
health-promoting behaviours develop positive, informed behaviours that
encourage them both to care for and respect themselves and others. These
behaviours support learners’ sense of self-worth, their overall mood and
energy levels

•  develop the confidence, motivation, physical competence, knowledge and
understanding that can help them lead healthy and active lifestyles which
promote good physical health and well-being

•  understand how decisions and actions impact on themselves, on others and

on wider society, both now and in the future. It can also help learners
understand the factors that influence decision-making, thus placing them in a
better position to make more informed and considered decisions

•  develop the critical-thinking skills necessary to consider their decision-making

in terms of possible implications

•  understand the important role of social influences on their lives.

•  supporting the principles of progression2 by encouraging learners to:

•

revisit and deepen learning in concepts within the statements of what matters
across a wide range of topics and aspects of physical education and health

•  develop their independence and agency in matters relating to physical

education and health: resulting in a growing responsibility for their own health
and well-being

•  develop their ability to make, justify and evaluate decisions
•  develop conceptual knowledge and critical understanding in a range of

aspects of physical education and health

•  develop practical skills increasing accuracy and proficiency
•

transfer understanding from their own well-being to that of others; becoming
more socially responsible.

GCSE PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND HEALTH 7

•  supporting the subject specific considerations for GCSE Physical Education and

Health3 by providing opportunities for learners to:
•  participate in physical activity and engage in a variety of roles, responsibilities

and environments

•  understand what factors, influences and behaviours shape physical health
•  consider what decisions influence their health and well-being and that of

others

•  understand the benefits of physical activity, including social, recreational and
performance aspects, as well as how it supports their physical health and
well-being

•  participate in various sports and activities to support the development and

refinement of gross and fine motor skills, transferable skills and the ability to
connect progress with perseverance and confidence

•  understand how factors can influence their health and well-being, develop the

skills to support healthy behaviours relating to these factors, and the
confidence and motivation to support those behaviours for life

•  explore the factors that impact on their mental health and well-being, these

•

may include, but are not limited to, the importance of regular exercise and the
effect of a balanced diet
reflect on the short-term, medium-term and long-term implications of the
decisions they make, and the impact of decisions not only on oneself, but on
other people and wider society

•  participate in a range of team and individual sports to support their

understanding and application of positive health behaviours. This also
supports the development of team-working, resilience and individual
confidence. A study of sport can also unlock aspects of social history, politics,
geography and science in Wales and across the world.

GCSE PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND HEALTH 8

1.3  Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is
designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the
conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages
3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills
and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares
learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation
for the study of Physical Education at either AS or A level. In addition, the
specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for
learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

1.4  Guided learning hours

GCSE Physical Education and Health has been designed to be delivered within 120
– 140 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-
year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

1.5  Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our
language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect
and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and
adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising
that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to
ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres
of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always
be on the website.

1.6  Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic,
religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible,
features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access
and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual
orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to
enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills
without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the
following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access
Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This
document is available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of
provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete
barrier to any part of the assessment.

3.2  Arrangements for non-examination assessment

Unit 2: Overview

This assessment will include three parts:

1.  Perform in one sport or physical activity from the approved list (20% of

qualification)

2.  Perform in a second sport or physical activity or provide coaching in a sport or

physical activity from the approved list (20% of qualification)

3.  Plan, implement and evaluate a personal training activity (of self) over 8-10

weeks for a sport or physical activity from the approved list (20% qualification)

Learners who select coaching for Part 2 can be assessed in the same or different
sport or physical activity from the approved list as that selected for Part 1.

For Part 3, learners can be assessed in the same or different sport or physical
activity from the approved list as that selected for Part 1 and/or Part 2.

Physical activities/sports can be off-site. Off-site activities are those that do not take
place at the centre and/or cannot be performed live at the centre.

Any off-site activities that do not take place at the centre and where it would be
difficult to moderate "live" on moderation day, must have appropriate audio-visual
evidence. This evidence is subject to the visiting moderator as is any other activity.

Tasks are externally set. Tasks and assessment criteria will remain the same for the
lifetime of the qualification.

Assessment must be marked by the Centre and moderated by a WJEC visiting
moderator.

Appropriate audio-visual evidence must be available for the performance of any
candidate that cannot be seen ‘live’ on moderation day.

Each part will be marked out of a total of 40 marks. The unit will be marked out of a
total of 120 marks.

4  MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's
regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in
the preparation of work for GCSE Physical Education and Health.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our Guide to preventing, reporting and
investigating malpractice.

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC
(malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or
disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet Suspected
Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

5.1  Making entries

This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the
course. The non-examination assessment for Unit 2 can be completed earlier in the
course but must be submitted at the end of the course. The non-examination
assessment for Unit 2 must be submitted during the assessment window set by
WJEC in the final year of study.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series until the end of the
life of this specification. Summer 2028 will be the first assessment opportunity.

A qualification may be taken more than once.

Marks for non-examination assessment (NEA) may be carried forward for the life of
the specification. If a candidate resits an NEA unit (rather than carrying forward the
previous NEA mark), it is the new mark that will count towards the overall grade,
even if it is lower than a previous attempt (unless the mark is absent).

5.2  Grading, awarding and reporting

GCSE qualifications are reported on an eight point scale from A*-G, where A* is the
highest grade. Results not attaining the minimum standard for the award will be
reported as U (unclassified).
