## GCSE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY

## <span id="page-5-0"></span>1 INTRODUCTION

## <span id="page-5-1"></span>1.1 Aims

GCSE Digital technology supports learners to:

- become independent, confident and knowledgeable users of existing, new and emerging digital technologies
- understand the impact digital technologies can have on individuals and wider society and the ways in which they can bring about change
- develop skills in organising and analysing data to identify trends and audiences
- become creators of digital products, in a variety of formats and for a variety of purposes, that meet specified, authentic needs
- develop transferable skills in using a range of hardware and software
- develop their understanding of the systems development life cycle (SDLC) and of how ideas can become products

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales' Approval Criteria.

## <span id="page-5-2"></span>1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Digital Technology qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/statements-of-what-matters/)  [what matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/statements-of-what-matters/) and those [subject specific skills and concepts](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area) outlined in the '[Designing](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/designing-your-curriculum/)  [your Curriculum](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/designing-your-curriculum/)' section of the Science and Technology Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix C provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted in page 33; the Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

The GCSE Digital Technology qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:

- supporting the statements of what matters[1](#page-5-3) by giving learners the opportunity to:
  - develop curiosity about technology
  - process data to solve a wide range of real-world problems
  - understand computational processes have changed the way we live, work, study and interact with each other and our environment
  - provide the foundation for all software and hardware systems
  - create and use digital technologies to their full potential
  - understand how digital technologies work
  - understand that there are broad legal, social and ethical consequences to the use of technology

<span id="page-5-3"></span><sup>©</sup> WJEC CBAC Ltd 2025. <sup>1</sup> <https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/statements-of-what-matters/>

{6}------------------------------------------------

- make informed decisions about the future development and application of technology.
- supporting the principles of progression[2](#page-6-3) by encouraging learners to:
  - apply an iterative approach, through trial and improvement, to design processes
  - investigate, explore, analyse, problem-solve and design creative solutions
  - consider ethical and moral dilemmas linked to the use of technology.
- supporting the subject specific considerations for Digital Technology[3](#page-6-4) by giving learners opportunities to:
  - explore the design, development and application of technology, software and systems
  - develop digital skills using a range of technology and software.

## <span id="page-6-0"></span>1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of GCSE Digital Technology at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

## <span id="page-6-1"></span>1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE of Digital Technology has been designed to be delivered within 120 – 140 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

## <span id="page-6-2"></span>1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

<span id="page-6-4"></span><sup>3</sup> [https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area)[this-area](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area)

{7}------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="page-7-0"></span>1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website [\(www.jcq.org.uk\)](http://www.jcq.org.uk/).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

## <span id="page-8-0"></span>2 SUBJECT CONTENT

#### <span id="page-8-1"></span>How to read the amplification

The amplification provided in the right-hand column uses the following four stems:

- 'Learners should know' is used when learners are required to demonstrate basic knowledge and understanding.
- 'Learners should understand' is used when learners are required to demonstrate greater depth of knowledge and understanding, application of knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and analysis and evaluation of information for a given purpose.
- 'Learners should be able to' is used when learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques.

The use of the word 'including' indicates that the specified content must be taught and could be subject to assessment.

The use of the words 'for example' or 'such as' indicates that the specified content is for guidance only, and alternative examples could be chosen.

{35}------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="page-35-0"></span>3.2 Arrangements for non-examination assessment

#### **Unit 2: Overview**

For this assessment, learners receive a client brief that describes the organisation on which they will base their non-examination assessment, along with some basic background information, such as its purpose. The client brief will introduce the requirements for the non-examination assessment and identify the digital files learners will use. It will also provide details of the products to be produced and the timescales involved.

Learners will be provided with qualitative data, including details of styles and themes for the digital products. They will have dedicated research time to source digital assets needed for their products. This research time does not form part of their nonexamination assessment time, and during this period they will have access to the internet.

Learners will then be required to use a quantitative dataset and apply different skills to identify audience needs, trends and preferences for the project.

Learners must create two digital products based on the purpose of the client brief. All learners must produce a multi-page website, and they may choose to create either a computer game or a 2D animation. Learners must develop, plan and implement their digital products, demonstrating a range of digital skills. They must also test the functionality of their digital products throughout the development process.

At the end of the project, learners analyse the effectiveness of their ongoing testing and evaluate their completed digital products, development process and application of skills.

Learners may complete the assessment anytime during the course. However, centres should ensure that assessment is completed only when learners have undertaken the necessary teaching and learning and developed the required skills and knowledge.

The assessment contributes to 40% of the overall qualification. The unit will be marked out of total of 80 marks.

The client brief will be set by WJEC annually and available via the WJEC Portal in September during the first year of study and every year thereafter. The client brief will change annually, the tasks and mark scheme will remain the same.

This unit will be assessed by the centre and externally moderated by WJEC.

#### **Unit 3: Overview**

For this assessment, learners receive a client brief that describes the organisation on which they will base their non-examination assessment, along with some basic background information, such as its aims. They will be required to plan and create a video for a digital marketing campaign.

Learners must undertake research on social media platforms to recommend a suitable platform for the organisation specified in the client brief. Based on their research, they will develop a digital marketing campaign document outlining their recommendation. During their research time, they must also source digital assets. This research time does not form part of their non-examination assessment time, and during this period they will have access to the internet.

{36}------------------------------------------------

Learners will then develop a plan for their campaign. Using the digital assets they have created or manipulated, they will produce a digital marketing campaign video, applying suitable software skills in its production. Lastly, learners will export the video in a suitable format.

Learners may complete the assessment anytime during the course. However, centres should ensure that assessment is completed only when learners have undertaken the necessary teaching and learning and developed the required skills and knowledge.

The assessment contributes to 20% of the overall qualification. The unit will be marked out of total of 60 marks.

The client brief will be set by WJEC annually and available via the WJEC Portal in September during the first year of study and every year thereafter. The client brief will change annually, the tasks and mark scheme will remain the same.

This unit will be assessed by the centre and externally moderated by WJEC.

## <span id="page-38-0"></span>5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

#### <span id="page-38-1"></span>5.1 Entries and Awards

This is a unitised qualification. Learners are entered for each unit separately.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer assessment period each year, until the end of the life of the specification.

Unit 2 and Unit 3 will first be available in 2027 (and every year thereafter). Unit 1 will be available in 2028 (and every year thereafter) and the qualification will be awarded for the first time in summer 2028.

#### Pre-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or under on 31st August in the academic year in which they were entered)

The terminal rule is set at 40% of the overall qualification for Pre-16 Candidates for GCSE Digital Technology.

If the assessment being re-taken contributes to the 40% terminal rule requirement, the mark for the new assessment will count regardless of previous results in that assessment.

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade subject to the terminal rule being satisfied first i.e. that candidates must complete a minimum amount of the assessment for a qualification in the series in which they are cashing in.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s). This is referred to as a 'fresh start'. When retaking a qualification (fresh start), a candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from examination units taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating the new grade(s).

If a candidate has been entered for, but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be used for the life of the specification.

If a candidate has been entered for, but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate.

#### Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1st September in the academic year in which they are entered)

There is no terminal rule that applies to Post-16 Candidates for GCSE Digital Technology.

There is no limit on the number of times a candidate can resit an individual unit; however, the better uniform mark score from the most two recent attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade.

The 'fresh start' rule does not apply to post-16 candidates.

{39}------------------------------------------------

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be used for the life of the specification.

#### <span id="page-39-0"></span>5.2 Grading, awarding and reporting

GCSE qualifications are reported on an eight point scale from A\*-G, where A\* is the highest grade. Results not attaining the minimum standard for the award will be reported as U (unclassified).

Individual unit results are reported on a uniform mark scale (UMS) with the following grade equivalences:

|                  | MAX. | A*  | A   | B   | C   | D  | E  | F  | G  |
