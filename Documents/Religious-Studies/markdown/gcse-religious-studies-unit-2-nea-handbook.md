| Direct | The use of resources is tightly prescribed. The centre must ensure that: <ul><li>all candidates are within direct sight of the supervisor throughout the session(s)</li><li>display materials which might provide assistance are removed or covered</li><li>there is no access to e-mail, the internet or mobile phones</li><li>candidates complete their work independently</li><li>interaction with other candidates does not occur</li><li>no assistance of any description is provided.</li><li>Candidates' work must always remain within the centre and must be stored securely between timetabled sessions. Where direct supervision is specified, the centre must ensure that the JCQ No Mobile Phone poster and JCQ Warning to Candidates is displayed.</li></ul> |  |
| Indirect | Candidates do not need to be directly supervised at all times. The centre must ensure that: <ul><li>all candidates participate in the assessment</li><li>there is sufficient supervision to ensure that work can be authenticated</li><li>the work an individual candidate submits for assessment is his/her own.</li><li>Candidates' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be stored securely between timetabled sessions.</li></ul> |  |

Centres must have in place systems to ensure candidates cannot access evidence they have been developing outside of supervised activities.

#### **Authentication**

Supervision must be in place to ensure the authenticity of evidence produced for summative assessment.

You should not provide input or guidance to candidates during the assessment time. This includes providing formative feedback on the evidence being produced. You can provide guidance on the requirements of the task and remind candidates of the mark bands and how they can be interpreted.

{5}------------------------------------------------

Candidates can review and redraft evidence independently within the time controls for the assessment.

Candidates must sign the declaration to confirm that all evidence submitted for moderation is their own work and that any sources used have been acknowledged.

Assessors must sign the declaration to confirm that evidence submitted for moderation was completed under the controlled conditions set out in this assessment.

Assessors must check pre-assessment research notes to ensure that pre-prepared answers are not used for completion of tasks.

#### **Candidate evidence**

The acceptable formats for evidence of each of the tasks is summarised in the task tables. Any modified assessment must enable the candidate to generate the evidence required in this table.

#### **Marking the assessment**

The marking scheme for this assessment are included in this handbook.

All marking of evidence must be made against the marking scheme provided.

Evidence marked must comply with any requirements set out in the candidate information in this handbook and on the NEA brief.

Written evidence must be annotated to show how it relates to the mark band requirements. Marking should only be undertaken by a designated assessor. An assessor should have appropriate expertise in the subject and level for a specified unit. The assessor is responsible for ensuring that:

- assessment is conducted under the controls specified in the task table
- they are clear about the requirements of the assessment and marking scheme prior to commencing assessment
- evidence presented for assessment is valid, authentic; reliable and credible
- assessment decisions are accurately recorded
- evidence is appropriately annotated
- judgements are only made against the mark band statements.

A mark record sheet must be completed for each candidate.

#### **Further information**

You should refer the JCQ Instructions for conducting non-examination assessment for further information on managing assessment within our GCSE Qualifications.

{6}------------------------------------------------

#### **Assessment details**

Each year, WJEC will select **two** of the following set themes and will provide a statement associated with each theme:

- (a) marriage, adultery, divorce and remarriage
- (b) artificial contraception and natural family planning
- (c) cohabitation and sex before and outside marriage
- (d) same-sex relationships, civil partnerships and same-sex marriage
- (e) interfaith relationships and marriage outside the religious tradition

- (g) religious upbringing, childhood ceremonies and faith-based schooling.

The following is an example of a statement linked to a theme:

- Theme Marriage, adultery, divorce and remarriage
- Statement 'Traditional religious views about marriage are no longer relevant'.

The statements to be used in live assessment are contained in the NEA brief released on Portal.

From the two themes and statements provided by WJEC, centres will choose **one** theme and an associated statement as the focus for learners' tasks.

The tasks must be based on the **two** religions studied (Christianity or Catholic Christianity and a world religion) in all other units, **and** non-religious beliefs.

For this assessment learners are required to undertake research on the chosen theme and to use their research findings to complete tasks.

This assessment contributes to 20% of the overall qualification grade and will take 6 hours to complete. Some tasks, such as research tasks, must be completed outside the dedicated 6 hours. The assignment should be completed in multiple sessions to allow enough time to complete research. The length of the sessions in the decision of the centre.

The assignment will be marked out of a total of **60** marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment on the NEA brief, (released on Portal) and will be internally marked by the centre and externally moderated by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be handwritten and scanned or completed digitally).

#### **End of tasks**

{12}------------------------------------------------

#### **Plagiarism**

The following information has been taken from the [JCQ Information for candidates –](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) no[nexamination assessments](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) and the [JCQ Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) Use in Assessments:](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/) [Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/) This tells you about things that you **must** and **must not** do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not understand, you **must** ask your teacher.

Plagiarism involves taking someone else's words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them off as your own. **It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously.** There are many ways to detect plagiarism:

- Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
- Markers are highly experienced subject specialists they may have read the source you are using or even marked the work you have copied from!
- Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and style of writing or punctuation.

#### **Penalties for breaking the regulations**

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, you will be referred to the Malpractice panel who might impose a penalty.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

**Remember – it's your qualification so it needs to be your own work.** 

{13}------------------------------------------------

# Mark scheme

The following mark scheme will be used to assess your work.

**0 marks will be awarded if there is no evidence or submitted work is not worthy of credit.** 

#### **Task 1**

Based on your research:

- summarise the relevant beliefs, teachings, practices and perspectives of the **two** religions you have studied in relation to the statement provided
- summarise the relevant non-religious beliefs and perspectives in relation to the statement provided.
