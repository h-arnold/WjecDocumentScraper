Centres must have in place systems to ensure candidates cannot access evidence they
have been developing outside of supervised activities.

Authentication

Supervision must be in place to ensure the authenticity of evidence produced for summative
assessment.

You should not provide input or guidance to candidates during the assessment time. This
includes providing formative feedback on the evidence being produced. You can provide
guidance on the requirements of the task and remind candidates of the mark bands and how
they can be interpreted.

Candidates can review and redraft evidence independently within the time controls for the
assessment.

Candidates must sign the declaration to confirm that all evidence submitted for moderation is
their own work and that any sources used have been acknowledged.

Assessors must sign the declaration to confirm that evidence submitted for moderation was
completed under the controlled conditions set out in this assessment.

Assessors must check pre-assessment research notes to ensure that pre-prepared answers

Assessment details

Each year, WJEC will select two of the following set themes and will provide a statement
associated with each theme:

(a)  marriage, adultery, divorce and remarriage
(b)  artificial contraception and natural family planning
cohabitation and sex before and outside marriage
(c)
(d)  same-sex relationships, civil partnerships and same-sex marriage
interfaith relationships and marriage outside the religious tradition
(e)
roles within family, including gender roles within relationships
(f)
religious upbringing, childhood ceremonies and faith-based schooling.
(g)

The following is an example of a statement linked to a theme:
•  Theme - Marriage, adultery, divorce and remarriage
•  Statement - ‘Traditional religious views about marriage are no longer relevant’.

The statements to be used in live assessment are contained in the NEA brief released on
Portal.

From the two themes and statements provided by WJEC, centres will choose one theme
and an associated statement as the focus for learners’ tasks.
The tasks must be based on the two religions studied (Christianity or Catholic Christianity
and a world religion) in all other units, and non-religious beliefs.

For this assessment learners are required to undertake research on the chosen theme and
to use their research findings to complete tasks.

This assessment contributes to 20% of the overall qualification grade and will take 6 hours to
complete. Some tasks, such as research tasks, must be completed outside the dedicated 6
hours. The assignment should be completed in multiple sessions to allow enough time to
complete research. The length of the sessions in the decision of the centre.

The assignment will be marked out of a total of 60 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment on the NEA brief, (released
on Portal) and will be internally marked by the centre and externally moderated by WJEC.
Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be handwritten and scanned or
completed digitally).

Information for candidates

This information should be given to candidates completing

NEA Unit 2 – Religion and relationships.

You will be provided with an NEA Brief which provides you with information on the themes
and statements for assessment.

Within this pack, you will find:
•

information for candidates, which tells you about things that you must and must not do
when you are completing the assessment
the mark scheme which will be used to assess your work

•

You will have 6 hours in total to complete this assessment.
You should spend approximately:

•  1 hours 30 minutes completing task 1

declaration that all work presented is your own work.

You are advised to check your work carefully to make sure that it is accurate and correct.

Plagiarism

The following information has been taken from the JCQ Information for candidates –
nonexamination assessments and the JCQ Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use in Assessments:
Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications. This tells you about things that you must and must
not do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not
understand, you must ask your teacher.

Plagiarism involves taking someone else’s words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them
off as your own. It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously. There are many
ways to detect plagiarism:
•  Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
•  Markers are highly experienced subject specialists – they may have read the source you

•

are using or even marked the work you have copied from!
Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match
phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and
style of writing or punctuation.

Penalties for breaking the regulations

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, you will be referred to the
Malpractice panel who might impose a penalty.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

Remember – it’s your qualification so it needs to be your own work.
