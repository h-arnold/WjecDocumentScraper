Information for candidates

The following information has been taken from the JCQ Information for candidates – non-
examination assessments and the JCQ Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use in Assessments:
Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications. This tells you about things that you must and must
not do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not
understand, you must ask your teacher.

Preparing your work

•  When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you need to

ensure that your final product reflects your own independent work and isn’t copied or
paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you must tell
your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
•  Take care of your work and keep it safe. Do not leave it lying around where your

•

classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You
must always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; do not
share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your
password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
•  Do not be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI

tools and chatbots) – this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort
of copying.

•  You must not write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

Plagiarism

Plagiarism involves taking someone else’s words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them
off as your own. It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously. Don’t think you
won’t be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:
•  Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
•  Markers are highly experienced subject specialists – they may have read the source you

•

are using or even marked the work you have copied from!
Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match
phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and
style of writing or punctuation.

Penalties for breaking the regulations

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be
applied:
•  The piece of work will be awarded zero marks.
•  You will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question.
•  You will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series.
•  You will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of

time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

Remember – it’s your qualification so it needs to be your own work.
