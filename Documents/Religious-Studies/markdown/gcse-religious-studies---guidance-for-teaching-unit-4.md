# Overview of Unit 4

Religion and human Rights (20% of the qualification)

The purpose of this unit is to:

- consider human rights issues from religious and non-religious perspectives
- enable an awareness of the importance of human rights issues in contemporary society through the lens of religious studies
- reflect on personal values and beliefs relating to human rights

Learners must complete tasks based on the **two** religions studied (Christianity or Catholic Christianity and a world religion) in all other units, **and** non-religious perspectives.

<span id="page-5-1"></span>

### Overview of arrangements for non-examination assessment

Each year, WJEC will select three of the following human rights issues:

- gender equality
- LGBTQ+ rights
- racial equality of Black, Asian and minority ethnic people and communities
- the right to education
- the right to freedom from slavery and forced labour
- the right to life and freedom from capital punishment
- the right to seek justice for human rights violations
- the rights of people with disabilities
- the rights of refugee and asylum seekers.

The themes will be set by WJEC annually and available via the WJEC Portal in September of the second year of study and every year thereafter.

Centres will choose **two** human rights issues as the focus of the non-examination assessment tasks.

The assessment must be based on the **two** religions studied in all other units (Christianity or Catholic Christianity and a world religion) and non-religious beliefs.

This assessment contributes to 20% of the overall qualification grade.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be set and marked by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be handwritten and scanned or completed digitally).

| In this unit, learners will develop understanding in: |                          |

# Unit 4 Teacher Guidance

<span id="page-7-1"></span><span id="page-7-0"></span>

{9}------------------------------------------------

Learners will need to write a summary of their research ensuring that they consider:

- the relevant articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
- how the work of the first charity or organisation supports the relevant articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
- the relevant beliefs, teachings, practices and perspectives from the two religions studied
- relevant beliefs and non-religious perspectives.

These pieces of work focus on Assessment Objective *2 (Apply knowledge and understanding of religious and non-religious beliefs, practices and teachings)* and the work is marked out of 15 marks for each task.

All this work including the research notes will have to be submitted to WJEC for marking.

An understanding of religious beliefs, teachings, practices and perspectives relating to human rights from Christianity or Catholic Christianity will be needed to access this work. The focus should be on the two human rights issues that the centre has chosen to focus on from the pre-released information.

It is important to consider diversity of views and perspectives within Christianity or Catholic Christianity.

An understanding of religious beliefs, teachings, practices and perspectives relating to human rights from the centres second religion will be needed to access this work. The focus should be on the two human rights issues that the centre has chosen to focus on from the pre-released information.

It is important to consider diversity of views and perspectives within the centre's second religion.

{10}------------------------------------------------

An understanding of non-religious perspectives related to human rights will be needed to access this work. The focus should be on the two human rights issues that the centre has chosen to focus from the pre-released information.

It is important to consider diversity of views and perspectives within nonreligious perspectives.

Consideration of sources of authority from both religious and non-religious perspectives will be needed as evidence to support their views and beliefs.

Work will need to be completed on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [\(Universal Declaration of Human Rights | OHCHR\)](https://www.ohchr.org/en/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) to ensure a broad understanding of them. Additionally, particular focus will need to be given to the relevant human rights issues your centre will focus on.

The relevant articles of human rights [\(30 articles on the 30 Articles of the](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2018/11/30-articles-30-articles-universal-declaration-human-rights)  [Universal Declaration of Human Rights | OHCHR\)](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2018/11/30-articles-30-articles-universal-declaration-human-rights) focus on:

- the right to education
- the right to freedom from slavery and forced labour
- the right to life and freedom from capital punishment
- the right to seek justice for human rights violations
- the rights of people with disabilities
- the rights of refugee and asylum seekers.

There may be more than one article relevant to the human rights issues your setting will be focusing on. It is noted in the sample assessment materials that you should not use more than five of the articles.

{11}------------------------------------------------

Learners will need to collate all the above knowledge and understanding into personal notes for use within the tasks of the NEA. These notes need to be no more than six pages of written or printed notes that can be used in tasks 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the NEA. These pages will be submitted alongside the work completed by learners on the tasks.

It would be advantageous to analyse and evaluate the religious and nonreligious beliefs, teachings, practices and perspectives as this work is being completed to assist with the completion of 4.2.2 work within the NEA.

It would be advantageous to analyse and evaluate the purpose, aims and work of the charities or organisations chosen by your setting to assist with the completion of 4.2.2 work within the NEA.

Whilst competing this section of work, it would be beneficial for learners to consider their own thoughts, views and beliefs in relation to human rights to assist them in developing their own values, beliefs and views in preparation for task 5 of the NEA.

Focused work will need to be completed on **two** charities or organisations, one for each human rights issue that the centre chooses to study.

When developing knowledge and understanding on these charities or organisations learners need support to ensure they consider:

- the aims and purpose of the charity or organisation
- how they campaign for the human rights issue
- how the work aligns with the relevant articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

As part of their work, learners will need to make individual personal notes to make use of when completing the NEA tasks. These notes need to be no more than four sides of A4 written or typed research notes that can be used in tasks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the NEA. These sources will need to be submitted with the learner's work.

It would be advantageous to analyse and evaluate the religious and non-religious beliefs, teachings, practices and perspectives as this work is being completed to assist with the completion of 4.2.2 work within the NEA.

It would be advantageous to analyse and evaluate the purpose, aims and work of the charities or organisations chosen by the centre to assist with the completion of 4.2.2 work within the NEA.

Whilst competing this section of work, it would be beneficial for learners to consider how their own thoughts, views and beliefs might align with the charities or organisations they have studied preparation for task 5 of the NEA.

{15}------------------------------------------------

#### 4.2.2

#### Considering the importance of human rights issues to society today

Learners should be able to analyse and evaluate the importance of human rights issues to society today based on:

- religious and non-religious perspectives
- purpose, aims and work of charities or organisations.

#### **Task 4**

This section focuses on task 4 of the NEA and needs to be completed under direct supervision. Task 4 has a completion time of 1 hour 30 minutes.

Learners can make use of all previous research notes and their answers from the previous tasks.

This task focuses on Assessment Objective 3 *(Analyse, evaluate, or make judgements on a variety of ethical and moral issues, religious and non-religious beliefs, teachings, practices, values and philosophical convictions)* and will be marked out of 15 marks. The completed work will be submitted to WJEC for marking.

Prior to learners completing this task in the NEA, teachers will need to support and guide them with how to analyse and evaluate the different perspectives (both religious and non-religious perspectives) on human rights and how to make judgements on these perspectives, if not previously competed as part of 4.1.1 and 4.2.1.

Prior to learners completing this task in the NEA, teachers will need to support and guide them with how to analyse and evaluate the purpose, aims and work of charities or organisations chosen by your setting and how to make judgements on these perspectives, if not previously competed as part of 4.1.1 and 4.2.1.

{16}------------------------------------------------

#### 4.2.3

#### Reflecting on personal values and beliefs

Learners should be able to:

- reflect on their own values and beliefs in relation to the human rights issue

This section focuses on task 5 of the NEA and needs to be completed under indirect direct supervision.

Learners are required to explain which of the charities or organisations selected most aligns most with their own values and beliefs (they could reflect on their findings from previous tasks).

Learners can make use of all previous research notes and their answers from the previous tasks.

This task focuses on Assessment Objective 4 *(Select, use and apply skills and techniques in practice relevant to the study of Religious Studies)*

Task 5 has a completion time of 1 hour. This work is completed under indirect supervision.

This task will be submitted to WJEC for marking.

Prior to learners completing this task in the NEA, teachers will need to support and guide them with how to reflect on their own personal values and beliefs in relation to the **two** human rights issues studied by your setting, if not previously completed as part of 4.1.1. and 4.2.1 work.

Prior to learners completing this task in the NEA, teachers will need to support and guide them with how to reflect on their own personal values and beliefs, and how they align with those of the charities or organisations studied.

# Finding appropriate sources

It is important to incorporate a range of source types within the unit, so that learners are familiar with, and equipped to analyse and evaluate, different sources and interpretations.

Sources can take a variety of forms, for example written documents, pictorial evidence or oral accounts, however they must adhere to the guidelines relevant to the Unit/Task being assessed.

The sources should be evaluated for their value to the set task. Encourage the candidates to address issues such as:

- What information does the source provide?
- Does the source back up your knowledge?
- Who was the author/maker?
- When was the source written?
- Why was it written?
- Is there any doubt over the author/maker? Is he/she trustworthy?

Look at each source on its merits and avoid mechanical phrases and comments.

### Primary Sources

These are original materials or documents, including (but not limited to) sacred texts, first interpretations, books and sermons, writing by religious officials, etc.

### Secondary Sources

These are materials that engage with and draw on primary sources through analysis, interpretation or summarising. They are created after the primary sources. Examples include (but are not limited to) documents such as published literature and review articles.
