In a religious context, belief refers to the acceptance of certain spiritual truths, teachings or principles, often centred around the existence of God or a divine being. Beliefs can shape how individuals perceive the world, their moral actions, and their understanding of life and death.<br><br>Being a religious person usually involves the practice of rituals, participation in a faith community, and adherence to moral and ethical guidelines derived from the beliefs a person holds. It also includes living out those beliefs in daily life, through practices such as prayer, worship, charity, and observance of religious laws.<br><br>Theist: a person who believes in the existence of a god or gods.<br><br>Monotheists: Theists who believe in the existence of only one God, such as in Christianity, Islam, and Judaism.<br><br>Polytheists: Theists who believe in the existence of multiple gods, as seen in religions like Hinduism (in some interpretations) and ancient Egyptian or Roman religions.<br><br>Religious Pluralists: People who believe that multiple religions can offer valid paths to truth, spirituality, or salvation, and that no single religion has a monopoly on truth.<br><br>Agnostics: Individuals who neither affirm nor deny the existence of God or gods, often believing that the existence of a divine being is unknowable or undecided. |

{9}------------------------------------------------

There are many different reasons why people believe in a god or gods. These may include:

- Personal encounters or feelings of spiritual connection to something greater than themselves.
- They have been brought up in a religious environment where belief in God is part of tradition and identity.
- Religion can provide answers to philosophical questions about purpose, morality and the afterlife.
- Being part of a religious community or group offers support, shared values, and a sense of identity.
- Faith in sacred texts and teachings, or belief in miracles and religious events, can strengthen a person's religious conviction.
- Religions can offer a structured moral code, giving believers guidance on how to live ethically.

Atheists do not believe in the existence of any gods or divine beings. They often emphasise the importance of scientific inquiry and empirical evidence to understand the world. Atheists may reject religious beliefs as unsupported by reason or evidence, focusing instead on human experiences, values, and the material world.

Humanists do not believe in any gods or divine beings. They emphasi se the value of human beings and seek to promote human flourishing through reason, science, and ethical principles. Humanists typically believe that meaning, purpose and morality are derived from human experience and the development of society rather than religious sources. They advocate for compassion, justice and the well -being of others, often placing emphasis on individual responsibility and the betterment of humanity.

{10}------------------------------------------------

There are many different reasons why some people do not believe in a god or gods. These may include:

- Many atheists seek empirical evidence for the existence of a higher or divine power and find that religious claims lack sufficient proof.
- A reliance on reason, logic, and critical thinking leads some to conclude that belief in gods is inconsistent with what we understand about the natural world.
- Scientific discoveries can provide explanations for phenomena traditionally attributed to divine forces, leading some to view religious beliefs as unnecessary or outdated.
- Some doubt the existence of a god based on philosophical arguments, such as the problem of evil, which questions how an omni-benevolent and omnipotent god could allow suffering.
- Being brought up in secular, non-religious cultures or communities may reduce the influence of religious belief, leading individuals to adopt a non-theistic worldview.
- Some may not experience a personal connection to a higher power or feel that spirituality is unnecessary for meaning, purpose or morality.

# **1.2a Beliefs — Christianity**

## 1.2.1a Key beliefs and teachings in Christianity

Learners should understand:

Christian beliefs and teachings about the nature of God:

- Creator ex nihilo*;* Genesis 1:1-2
- omnipotent
- omniscient
- omnibenevolent
- omnipresent.

<span id="page-10-0"></span>Christian beliefs and teachings about the Trinity: three aspects of one God:

• Father: Luke 15:11-32

• Son: John 1:1-3, 14

• Holy Spirit: John 14:25-26 and Galatians 5:22-23.

Christians believe that the universe was created by God. In the book of Genesis, it states that the world was created 'from nothing'. In Latin, this is 'ex nihilo' Therefore, God is the Creator 'ex nihilo' as he created it all from nothing.

Christians believe that God is omnipotent. This word originates in the Latin language and means 'all-powerful'. There is nothing God cannot do.

Christians also believe God is omniscient, which means 'all-knowing'. God knows all things, in the past, the present and the future.

Christians believe God is omnibenevolent, which means 'all-loving'. They believe that God is love, and that only good things come from God.

For Christians, God is omnipresent, which means he is present everywhere at all times.

Christians are monotheists, which means they believe in one God. There are three distinct persons in God, and these persons form a unity. This belief is called the Trinity, or 'Tri-unity'. The three persons of the Trinity are:

- God the Father the Creator and sustainer of all things
- God the Son Jesus Christ, the incarnation of God, who was the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of humanity
- God the Holy Spirit the power of God that is active in the world today.

All persons of the Trinity are fully God, co-equal and co-eternal.

Further analysis is required to understand the implications of these findings.

Christian beliefs and teachings about Jesus:

- birth: Matthew 1:18- 2:12, Luke 1:26-35 and 2:1-21
- incarnation as the Word: John 1:1-3, 10: 30-38, 14:1- 9
- ministry: Luke 5: 17-24, John 11: 21-27
- death: Mark 15:1-3
- Resurrection: John 20:1-21
- Ascension: Acts 1:9-11
- Jesus as the Messiah: Matthew 16:13-17
- as the way to salvation and atonement: John 3:16, 14:6.

In Luke 15:11-32, Jesus tells the Parable of the Lost Son. This story helps Christians to understand that God is a forgiving and merciful Father, who welcomes all those who turn to him as his children.

In John 1:1-3,14, Christians learn that Jesus is referred to as the Word. The Word existed 'in the beginning' (John 1:1) which emphasises the eternal nature of the Trinity. Jesus is the link between God and people.

John 14: 25-26 includes a clear statement about the Holy Spirit and its work in the world.

Similarly, Galatians 5:22-23 lists the 'fruits of the Spirit'. These are a list of virtues that Christians can develop with the help of the Holy Spirit.

Suggested learning activities:

- Design a symbol to represent each of the 'omni' words to help with learning their meanings
- Label a diagram of the Trinity to show understanding of the three distinct persons. Use this diagram to aid discussion of how the roles are distinct but interconnected, emphasising that all work together as one God.

Dramatised versions of the birth of Jesus can be found here:

incarnation – 'God made flesh'. This means God in human form. Jesus was fully human and fully divine. The birth narratives in Matthew and Luke highlight different aspects of Jesus' birth. They are found in Matthew 1:18- 2:12, Luke 1:26-35 and 2:1-21.

{13}------------------------------------------------

Word – Jesus is referred to as the Word in John's Gospel. Word comes from the Greek 'logos' and existed 'in the beginning'. This emphasises the eternal nature of the Trinity.

ministry – Jesus' ministry refers to his public life, during which he preached about God's Kingdom. His ministry focused on proclaiming repentance, love, mercy, and salvation. He performed miracles including healing the sick and casting out demons, which revealed God's power and Jesus' divine authority. Central to his teachings were parables that explained spiritual truths, like the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son. His ministry culminated in his death and resurrection, fulfilling his mission to redeem humanity.

Death – Christians believe that Jesus died to save humanity from sin and restore their relationship with God. Christians believe that sin separates them from God. Jesus, being sinless, took humanity's punishment upon himself by dying on the cross. This act of sacrificial love provides forgiveness for sin and opens the way to eternal life for all who believe in him.

Resurrection – Jesus rose from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion, demonstrating his victory over sin and death. It is central to the Christian faith, as it confirms his divine nature. Through his resurrection, Jesus offers believers the hope of eternal life and the assurance of a restored relationship with God.

Ascension – This event, 40 days after the resurrection, was when Jesus returned to heaven. It signifies the completion of Jesus' earthly mission and the beginning of his heavenly reign. Before ascending, Jesus commissioned his disciples to spread the Gospel (The Great Commission) and promised to send the Holy Spirit to empower them. Christians believe the ascension highlights Jesus' divine authority and assures believers of his continued presence.

{14}------------------------------------------------

Christian beliefs and teachings about the soul:

- created in the image of God; Genesis 1:27
- a divine spark originating from God; Genesis 2:7
- eternal and transcendent
- humans possess rationality and free will but have fallen; Genesis 1:26-28; Genesis 2:15-17 and Genesis 3.

Messiah – This means 'the anointed one' and refers to the one sent by God to be humanity's saviour. Christians believe this person to be Jesus. The writers of the Gospels suggest that all the predictions about the Messiah in the Old Testament came true in Jesus' life. In Matthew's Gospel, Peter identified Jesus as the Messiah.

Salvation – Christians believe that, through his death on the cross, Jesus saved humanity from their sins. Believing in Jesus offers the opportunity for salvation; they could now be reconciled with God and be with him in the afterlife. The name Jesus – Yeshua in Hebrew – means 'the Lord saves'.

Atonement – The death of Jesus was an act of atonement for the sins of the people in the world. The death of Jesus is therefore part of the process of the salvation of humanity.

Suggested learning activity:

• The following video clip is an excellent summary of Jesus' atoning sacrifice. Learners could watch this and write their own summary of atonement. For greater challenge, a word limit could be given.

[How God Deals With Evil Without Destroying Humanity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_OlRWGLdnw)

Christians believe that humans are created in the image of God (imago Dei) (Genesis 1:27). Christians also believe that God breathed life into humans which makes them different to all other species (Genesis 2:7). Following this, humans are therefore the only species to have a spiritual dimension, referred to as the 'soul'. This is the part of humans that connects with God and is the eternal part of them that lives on in the afterlife. The soul is considered transcendent because it is believed to exist beyond the physical body and material world. Human beings are created by God to be rational beings who can use their reason and judgement to make informed decisions. Humans are expected to rule over and look after the earth (Genesis 1:26-28). They also have free will, which means they have

{15}------------------------------------------------

Key beliefs and teachings of Christianity found within:

- the Apostles' Creed
- the Lord's Prayer.

the ability to make choices for themselves. However, when Adam and Eve disobeyed God's instruction (Genesis 2:15-17), they came to understand right and wrong but their perfect relationship with God was broken. This is called The Fall. (Genesis 3) A further consequence was that all human beings will inherit 'Original Sin' and carry this within their nature. This fallen nature means that humans are separated from God.

## Suggested learning activity:

Around the outline of a human body, learners could write each key term relating to the nature of human beings, e.g. imago Dei, soul, free will, etc. They could then do a match up activity where they place brief explanations with each key term.

## The Apostles' Creed:

This is a statement of Christian faith traditionally attributed to the apostles, though it was not directly written by them. It outlines the core Christian beliefs and is used in many Christian denominations as a declaration of faith, particularly during baptisms and worship. The creed is structured into three main sections, reflecting the Trinity. The creed emphasises unity of belief across Christian denominations.

## The Lord's Prayer:

The Lord's Prayer is taught by Jesus in the Gospels (Matthew 6:9– 13, Luke 11:2–4), and is a model for how Christians should pray. It begins by honouring God, expresses a desire for God's will to be done on earth, and asks for daily needs, forgiveness of sins, and deliverance from evil. It is both a personal and communal prayer, emphasising the believer's relationship with God and others.

## Suggested learning activities:

• Text analysis: Analyse the Apostles' Creed to identify key beliefs about the Trinity and the Church.

{16}------------------------------------------------

The importance of the Bible:

• using the Bible as a source of wisdom and guidance – literal, conservative and liberal interpretations.

The Bible is the holy book for Christians. They believe it is a book which has been inspired by the Holy Spirit and is 'God-breathed', therefore it is an important source of wisdom and authority for Christians. It is the revealed and inspired Word of God, so many Christians will turn to it for guidance. For example, the Ten Commandments are a list of rules for believers to abide by.

Literalists – some Christians are called literalists and believe that every word of the Bible is literally true. For example, a literalist would believe that God created the world in six days (24-hour periods) and created a man on the sixth day and made a woman out of man's rib as this is how the first two chapters of the book of Genesis described it.

Conservative Christians. Whilst they believe that the Bible is the revealed and inspired Word of God, they consider other factors need to be considered in discovering the meaning of the Bible. These Christians believe that readers must use their intelligence, the guidance of the Holy Spirit and Church teachings in order to understand the writers' intentions fully. For example, in the book of Genesis, Conservative Christians may suggest that the world was created by God in six periods of time, rather than days.

Liberal Christians see the Bible more as a personal guide to living a life pleasing to God, rather than something to be strictly followed. They may suggest that the Bible is written about God and contains useful information to help believers understand their faith better, but that, as it was written by humans inspired by God, it could contain errors. For example, the Creation story in Genesis simply helps humans to understand that God is the Creator of the world.

Suggested learning activity:

• Ask learners to create flashcards showing different ways of interpreting the Bible. Give examples of different biblical teaching e.g. Noah's Ark and ask learners to explain how each interpretation would view the passage.

{17}------------------------------------------------

Learners should understand:

Key Christian beliefs and teachings:

- supporting the poor; Acts 20:35
- giving generously; 2 Corinthians 9:7
- duty to put faith into action; James 2:17.

one another. In Acts 20:35, believers are reminded of Jesus' instruction to give rather than receive, which encourages them to support the poor and needy whenever possible.

Christians believe helping the poor is a fundamental expression of Christian love and charity, rooted in Jesus' teachings. Christians are encouraged to practise acts of mercy, share their resources, support social justice initiatives and work to address systemic causes of poverty. Charity and advocacy are seen as ways to build a more just and compassionate society, in line with Christ's command to love

In 2 Corinthians 9:7, St Paul emphasises the spirit in which giving should be undertaken. The act of giving is meaningful when it comes from the heart.

James 2:17 teaches that true faith is not passive; it requires action to be genuine and alive. This verse encourages believers to live out their faith in practical, observable ways, such as helping the poor.

Contemporary local or national examples of Christian faith and belief in action – community work and faith-based activism.

Examples of Christian faith in action could include: Christian Aid, World Vision, Tearfund, The Salvation Army, HOPE International, YMCA.

Community work includes people working to help others in their community. An example would be volunteering at a local food bank or soup kitchen to ensure the homeless or those in need are fed.

Faith-based activism is where someone is motivated by their faith to advocate for a particular cause. Examples vary widely but can include speaking out for political prisoners or those persecuted because of their faith.

They believe they will be judged after their death by God, who will decide on their eternal destiny. Belief in the sacrifice Jesus made for all people can bring salvation (John 3:16).

They believe that all people will be resurrected at the end of time (1 Corinthians 15:20-22). The faithful will be raised to eternal life with God, while others face judgement. The resurrected will receive glorified, imperishable bodies, free from pain, death, or decay. (1 Corinthians 15:42-44) This belief provides Christians with hope and purpose.<br><br>Luke 16:19-31 is the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus, which teaches Christians that their actions in this life will impact their place in the afterlife. |

{21}------------------------------------------------

John 11:24-27 recounts the time when Jesus identifies himself as the source of both resurrection (life after death) and life in the present. Faith in Jesus grants eternal life, and through him, believers will experience resurrection. Suggested learning activity: • Read through the biblical text of the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus. Discuss how the Rich Man's behaviour was unacceptable and suggest ways in which he could have behaved differently. How can this be placed into a modern-day context? 1.3.3a Christian mourning and funeral practices Learners should understand: The importance of mourning and funeral practices: • committing a person's body to God • giving thanks to God for that person's life • celebrating and remembering the life of the deceased • using signs and symbols to express a deeper meaning • showing the link between this life and Christian beliefs about life after death. Christian mourning practices: • use of symbols, such as wearing black • prayers recited for the deceased. Christian funerals will often include a celebration and thanksgiving for the life of the person who has died. While it is a sad occasion where people are grieving, there will be also be hope and trust in God. The body and the soul of the deceased is committed to God. There are symbols, prayers and readings that convey beliefs about eternal life. Christian funerals reflect the link between this life and Christian beliefs about life after death. For example, the service will express the hope of eternal life and the resurrection of the body on the Last Day. Christian funerals emphasise that death is not the end, and through the mercy of God, the deceased is now at rest in God's eternal presence. Christians often wear black to a funeral as a symbol of mourning. Some Christians will recite prayers for the deceased, such as 'Eternal Rest' prayer, which affirms their faith in the afterlife and the promise of eternal peace with God for all who die in Christ. For example, the priest or vicar may wear purple vestments. Purple is a sign of repentance and forgiveness of sins as well as a sign of hope. Some Christians may use white lilies on or around the coffin to represent purity and the hope in eternal life for the deceased.

{22}------------------------------------------------

## Christian funeral practices:

- vigil service
- funeral service prayers, hymns and eulogy
- burial or cremation and the rite of committal.

## Christian funeral practices:

Vigil Service: This sometimes takes place the evening before the funeral and includes the Reception of the Body. It is a short service where the body of the deceased is received into the church, with readings and prayers. The coffin is then left in the church overnight in readiness for the funeral the following day.

Funeral service: The service begins with prayers, scripture readings, or hymns, acknowledging God's presence and offering comfort to the grieving. Passages are read from the Bible that emphasise God's love, hope in the resurrection, and eternal life.

Eulogy – there may be a short talk about the deceased person, where a relative or friend speaks about and celebrates their life.

Prayers are offered for the deceased, asking God to welcome them into eternal rest, and for the comfort of the grieving.

Songs of faith, hope, and comfort may be sung or played. Examples include "Amazing Grace" or "How Great Thou Art."

At the graveside or crematorium, final prayers and blessings are given as the body is laid to rest. Words like "ashes to ashes, dust to dust" acknowledge human mortality while affirming resurrection hope. This is referred to as the Rite of Committal, and it reflects the Christian beliefs in the eternal life promised in Christ, and the peace of knowing that the deceased is now in God's care. Through this ritual, the Church reaffirms its faith in life after death and comforts the grieving.

## Suggested learning activity:

• Learners could create a flow diagram to show the different parts of the Christian funeral service. For greater challenge, they could include examples of symbolism.

{24}------------------------------------------------

The role, significance and features of the following sites of Christian pilgrimage:

- St David's Cathedral, Pembrokeshire
- Taizé.

Christian identity and belonging expressed through symbolic actions – rites of passage.

The role, significance and features of:

- baptism: Mark 1:9-11, infant; implied in Acts 16:33 and believers' baptism; Acts 2:37-41
- eucharist/communion: 1 Corinthians 11:23-26
- confirmation: Acts 2:1-13.

Suggested learning activity:

• Research a Christian place of pilgrimage and create a presentation to show why believers visit there and what they might do there.

Christians visit St David's in Pembrokeshire on pilgrimage to honour St David, the patron saint of Wales, and deepen their faith. St David, a 6th-century bishop and missionary, founded a monastic community at St David's. Pilgrims visit his shrine to seek spiritual inspiration and pray for guidance. St David's Cathedral, built on the site of his monastery, is a place of great religious and historical importance. During the Middle Ages, two pilgrimages to St David's were considered equal to one to Rome. Pilgrims often seek reflection, prayer, and renewal of their faith. The surrounding Pembrokeshire coastline adds to the sense of awe and connection to God's creation. Pilgrims may also visit St Non's Chapel and Holy Well, said to be the birthplace of St David.

Some Christians visit Taizé, an ecumenical monastic community in France, for spiritual renewal, prayer and fellowship. It is a place of pilgrimage, particularly for young people, fostering unity among Christians of different traditions. Pilgrims participate in the community's worship, which includes meditative chants, silence, and scripture readings, focusing on simplicity and inner peace. Pilgrims live simply, sharing meals and chores, experiencing a sense of unity and solidarity. Taizé emphasises healing divisions between Christians and building bridges between cultures and denominations. The community also offers programs for young people, encouraging them to reflect on their purpose, faith, and role in creating peace.

Baptism is the first sacrament by which a person becomes a member of the Church, which originated at the baptism of Jesus (Mark 1:9- 11). A person who is baptised is welcomed into the family of faith through the Holy Spirit. Some Christian Churches baptise infants, while others prefer to baptise adults, which is called believers'

{25}------------------------------------------------

baptism. Evidence for both types of baptism can be found in the Bible. For example, infant baptism is implied in Acts 16:33, while believers' baptism is seen in Acts 2:37 -41.

Suggested video clip: [Christian Baptism](https://www.truetube.co.uk/resource/christian-baptism/)  - TrueTube

## Suggested learning activity:

• Debate – Learners could evaluate whether infants or adults should be baptised and give reasons for their views.

The Eucharist / Communion was instituted by Jesus Christ at the Last Supper. Eucharist is a Greek word meaning 'thanksgiving' and many Christians believe it is an opportunity to celebrate all that God has done through the death and resurrection of Jesus. (1 Corinthians 11:23 -26)

Different denominations will have different beliefs about the bread and wine during the service. For example, some Christians such as the Lutheran Church believe in consubstantiation, which is where Jesus is truly present within the bread and wine, but they remain unchanged. However, Baptists may believe the bread and wine are symbols of Jesus' body and blood. The Eucharist is spiritual food for the believer, and it strengthens them to carry out their mission and vocation in the world.

## Suggested learning activities:

- Read a Gospel account of the Last Supper. Now, use an inference grid to explore a piece of modern art depicting the Last Supper, for example 'The Jesus Table' by Sieger Köder. What links can learners make between the artwork and the Gospel account?
- Make a chart to show the different interpretations of the Eucharist, e .g. transubstantiation, consubstantiation, Real Presence, symbolic. For greater challenge, research the

{26}------------------------------------------------

Christian denominations who may hold a specific belief about the Eucharist and include them in the table. Some churches perform the rite of confirmation, which allows a person to renew the vows made at baptism and to take on their Christian commitment for themselves. Many Christians believe that the person being confirmed receives the Holy Spirit in a special way to enable them to carry out their mission and vocation in the world. This reflects the moment at Pentecost when the disciples received the Holy Spirit, as Jesus had promised. (Acts 2:1-13). Suggested learning activity: • Explore the vows made by a confirmation candidate and identify what the vows mean and how they can be lived out in everyday life. 1.4.2a Christianity and morality Learners should understand: Christian beliefs and teachings about how to make moral decisions: • obeying divine commands: the Ten Commandments; Exodus 20:1-17 • the Bible as a source of morality: • Christian love (agape): Luke 10:25-37; Luke 13:34-35 • forgiveness: Matthew 6:12; Matthew 18:21-22; Luke 23:34 and Matthew 5:43-44 • the use of conscience to make moral decisions; 2 Corinthians 1:12. For Christians, deciding what is right and wrong is linked to the teachings of Christ, the teachings of the Church, and the will of God. Any act or action that goes against the will of God can be defined as 'wrong'. Christians use their conscience, faith, the Bible and Church teaching when making important decisions and deciding if an act is right or wrong. Christians believe that God has given them guidelines to help them understand morally right behaviour. For example, the Ten Commandments, or Decalogue, are found in the Old Testament (Exodus 20:1-17) and form the basis of all moral behaviour. The basis of Jesus' teachings is love. The word Jesus uses for 'love' comes from the Greek word 'agapè' and refers to the love God has for humans and the type of unselfish, compassionate love humans should show to others. This is illustrated in the Parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37). For Christians, this unconditional love means putting the well-being of others before your own. Christians believe that Jesus' sacrifice on the cross was an ultimate example of agapè.

{27}------------------------------------------------

In Luke 13:34-35, Jesus is distressed due to the lack of love being shown among the people. He warns them of the consequences of this behaviour.

Suggested video clip: Agape - Love - YouTube

## Suggested learning activities:

- Evaluate which is the most important source of morality for Christians. For example, the Bible, Jesus' example, conscience, Church teaching.
- Ask learners to create a short video, TikTok, or slideshow retelling the parable of the Good Samaritan in their own words or in a modern setting. Share and discuss the videos, focusing on how each retelling conveys the core message of the parable.

Forgiveness is an important concept, and Jesus refers to it many times – in parables, when asked questions about how his followers should behave and even when he was being put to death (Luke 23:34). Jesus teaches that God is forgiving but that forgiveness of humans depends on whether people are willing and able to forgive others. This idea is referred to in the Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:12). Forgiveness is an ongoing process and should be repeated as many times as is necessary (Matthew 18:21-22). Forgiveness is challenging for believers, but Jesus extends the idea even further and links it to the notion of 'loving your enemy' (Matthew 5:43-44).

## Suggested learning activity:

Research case studies on forgiveness and give reasons why the person involved could/could not forgive.

Some examples can be found here: Examples of personal forgiveness - Forgiveness - GCSE Religious Studies Revision - WJEC - BBC Bitesize

{28}------------------------------------------------

Morality and Divine judgement in the afterlife:

- treasures on earth and in Heaven; Matthew 6:19-21 and Luke 16:19-31
- future judgement based on earthly actions; Matthew 25:31-46 - Parable of the Sheep and the Goats.

Learners should have a basic understanding of:

- what is meant by the problem of evil what is meant by moral evil (caused by humans) and natural evil (caused by nature)
- the philosophical challenges posed by belief in God and the existence of evil and suffering – the inconsistent triad
- what a theodicy is, and how the Irenaean (soulmaking) and Augustinian (soul-deciding) theodicies attempt to address the problem of evil.

The word conscience comes from the Latin words con meaning 'with' and scientia meaning 'knowledge'. Many Christians believe that conscience is a God-given ability to know the difference between right and wrong, (2 Corinthians 1:12) as part of being created imago Dei.

As part of his moral teachings, Jesus spoke about how someone could be rewarded for their good actions and likened the reward to treasure in Heaven (Matthew 6:19-21). He taught that doing good deeds was like making deposits into a spiritual treasury where it is secure, safe from being stolen, losing value or being destroyed (Luke 16:19-31).

In the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats, Jesus taught about General Judgement, which will take place on the Last Day. Jesus will return to earth in his Second Coming, or Parousia, and will judge all people according to their response to those in need while on earth (Matthew 25:31-46).

Christians also believe they will receive judgement at the moment of their death. God will judge their earthly actions and decide if they will spend all eternity in Heaven or Hell.

Suggested learning activity:

• Read the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats and make a list of the expectations of those who will be sent to Heaven/Hell.

Moral evil – This is suffering caused by humans' moral choices. Examples could include murder, rape, theft, violence, lying. Natural evil – This is suffering caused by natural events and therefore it is argued attributable to God if God created the world. Examples could include earthquakes, flooding, drought, hurricanes.

{29}------------------------------------------------

Suggested learning activity:

• Research case studies of evil and suffering and decide if they are examples of moral or natural evil.

The presence of evil in the world sometimes causes people to question God's existence. J . L . Mackie identified the 'inconsistent triad', where he suggested that the following three (triad) things are inconsistent as they cannot all be true at the same time: He said that if God is omnipotent (all -powerful) and omnibenevolent (all -loving), then evil would not exist. However, we have experienced evil and know that it exists. Therefore, either God is not all -powerful because he cannot stop suffering, or he is not all -loving because he doesn't want to stop suffering. This dilemma is called the Problem of Evil.

Suggested learning activity:

• Draw a diagram to represent the Inconsistent Triad.

The word theodicy comes from two Greek terms: Theos – God and Dike – Justice. A theodicy attempts to justify the existence of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God in the light of the existence of evil.

Two early Church Fathers put forward their theodicies to try to explain the problem of evil. These are Augustine and Irenaeus.

Augustine believed that suffering was the fault of humans and angels who used their free will to turn away from God. Humans and angels are to blame for the suffering in the world not God. Augustine taught that God gives humans the chance to be forgiven for sin through Jesus' death on the cross. If humans turn back to God, then they will be in Heaven (Soul -deciding theodicy ) .

{30}------------------------------------------------

<span id="page-29-0"></span>

|  | Irenaeus believed that God made mankind in his ‘image to grow into his likeness’. God allows humans to suffer so that humans grow to be more like him. God has given humans free will and we can make good or bad choices. Irenaeus believed that all humans will be in heaven (Soul-making theodicy). |

# **1.2b Beliefs — Catholic Christianity**

1.2.1b Key beliefs and teachings in Catholic Christianity

Learners should understand:

Catholic beliefs and teachings about the nature of God:

- Creator ex nihilo; Genesis 1:1-12
- omnipotent
- omniscient
- omnibenevolent
- omnipresent.

Catholic beliefs and teachings about the Trinity: three persons, one God:

- St. Augustine's De Trinitate 8.10
- Father: Luke 15:11-32
- Son: John 1:1-3, 14
- Holy Spirit: John 14:25-26 and Galatians 5:22-23.

Catholics believe that God is love (1 John 4:16; Deus Caritas Est – Benedict XV1) and is the Redeemer of the World (CCC 410-412). Catholics also believe that the universe was created by God. In the book of Genesis, it states that the world was created 'from nothing'. In Latin, this is 'ex nihilo' Therefore, God is the Creator 'ex nihilo' as he created it all from nothing.

Catholics believe that God is omnipotent. This word originates in the Latin language and means 'all-powerful'. There is nothing God cannot do.

Catholics also believe God is omniscient, which means 'all-knowing'. God knows all things, in the past, the present and the future.

Catholics believe God is omnibenevolent, which means 'all-loving'. They believe that God is love and that only good things come from God.

For Catholics, God is omnipresent, which means he is present everywhere at all times.

Catholics are monotheists, which means they believe in one God. There are three distinct persons in God and these persons form a unity. This belief is called the Trinity, or 'Tri-unity'. The three persons of the Trinity are:

- God the Father the Creator and sustainer of all things
- God the Son Jesus Christ, the incarnation of God, who was the ultimate sacrifice for the sins of humanity
- God the Holy Spirit the power of God that is active in the world today.

The Catechism teaches Catholics that the divine persons are

{32}------------------------------------------------

consubstantial, distinct from and relative to one another (CCC 253 - 256 ) . This means that all persons of the Trinity are fully God, co equal and co -eternal.

St Augustine emphasised the unity and equality of the three persons of the Trinity in his document 'De Trinitate' – no part of the Trinity is greater than the others.

In Luke 15:11 -32, Jesus tells the Parable of the Lost Son. This story helps Christians to understand that God is a forgiving and merciful Father, who welcomes all those who turn to him as his children.

In John 1:1 -3,14, Christians learn that Jesus is referred to as the Word. The Word existed 'in the beginning' (John 1:1) which emphasises the eternal nature of the Trinity. Jesus is the link between God and people.

John 14: 25 -26 includes a clear statement about the Holy Spirit and its work in the world.

Similarly, Galatians 5:22 -23 lists the 'fruits of the Spirit'. These are a list of virtues that Christians can develop with the help of the Holy Spirit.

Acts 2:1 -18 includes the account of Pentecost, when the disciples received the Holy Spirit for the first time, as promised by Jesus.

Suggested learning activities:

- Design a symbol to represent each of the 'omni' words to help with learning their meanings .
- Label a diagram of the Trinity to show understanding of the three distinct persons. Use this diagram to aid discussion of how the roles are distinct but interconnected, emphasising that all work together as one God.

{33}------------------------------------------------

Catholic beliefs and teachings about Jesus:

- birth: Matthew 1:18- 2:12, Luke 1:26-35 and 2:1-21
- Incarnation of the Word: John 1:1-3, 10: 30-38, 14:1-9
- ministry; Luke 5: 17-24, John 11: 21-27
- death: Mark 15:1-3
- resurrection: John 20:1-21
- ascension: Acts 1:9-11
- Jesus as Messiah: Matthew 16:13-17
- as the way to salvation and atonement: John 3:16, 14:6.

Dramatized versions of the birth of Jesus can be found here: [The Gospel of Matthew -](https://www.truetube.co.uk/resource/the-gospel-of-matthew-the-nativity/) The Nativity - TrueTube [The Gospel of Luke -](https://www.truetube.co.uk/resource/the-gospel-of-luke-the-nativity/) The Nativity - TrueTube

incarnation – 'God made flesh'. This means God in human form. Jesus was fully human and fully divine. The birth narratives in Matthew and Luke highlight different aspects of Jesus' birth. They are found in Matthew 1:18- 2:12, Luke 1:26-35 and 2:1-21.

Word – Jesus is referred to as the Word in John's Gospel. Word comes from the Greek 'logos' and existed 'in the beginning'. This emphasises the eternal nature of the Trinity.

ministry – Jesus' ministry refers to his public life, during which he preached about God's Kingdom. His ministry focused on proclaiming repentance, love, mercy and salvation. He performed miracles including healing the sick and casting out demons, which revealed God's power and Jesus' divine authority. Central to his teachings were parables that explained spiritual truths, like the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son. His ministry culminated in his death and resurrection, fulfilling his mission to redeem humanity.

death – Jesus died to save humanity from sin and restore their relationship with God. Catholics believe that sin separates them from God. Jesus, being sinless, took humanity's punishment upon himself by dying on the cross. This act of sacrificial love provides forgiveness for sin and opens the way to eternal life for all who believe in him.

Resurrection – Jesus rose from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion, demonstrating his victory over sin and death. It is central to the Christian faith, as it confirms his divine nature. Through his resurrection, Jesus offers believers the hope of eternal life and the assurance of a restored relationship with God.

{34}------------------------------------------------

Ascension – This event, 40 days after the resurrection, was when Jesus returned to heaven to sit at the right hand of God the Father. It signifies the completion of Jesus' earthly mission and the beginning of his heavenly reign. Before ascending, Jesus commissioned His disciples to spread the Gospel (The Great Commission) and promised to send the Holy Spirit to empower them. Catholics believe the ascension highlights Jesus' divine authority and assures believers of His continued presence.

Messiah – This means 'the anointed one' and refers to the one sent by God to be humanity's saviour. Catholics believe this person to be Jesus. The writers of the Gospels suggest that all the predictions about the Messiah in the Old Testament came true in Jesus' life. In

Matthew's Gospel, Peter identified Jesus as the Messiah. Salvation – Catholics believe that, through his death on the cross, Jesus saved humanity from their sins. Believing in Jesus offers the opportunity for salvation; they could now be reconciled with God and be with him in the afterlife. The name Jesus – Yeshua in Hebrew – means 'the Lord saves'.

Atonement – The death of Jesus was an act of atonement for the sins of the people in the world. The death of Jesus is therefore part of the process of the salvation of humanity.

Catholic beliefs and teachings about the nature of the soul:

- the soul is the innermost aspect and spiritual principle of the human person created in the image of God; Genesis 1:27a
- a divine spark originating from God; Genesis 2:7
- immortal and transcendent
- humans possess rationality and free will but have fallen; Genesis 1:26-28; Genesis 2:15-17 and Genesis 3.

Catholics believe that humans are created in the image of God (imago Dei) (Genesis 1:27). Catholics also believe that God breathed life into humans which makes them different to all other species (Genesis 2:7). Following this, humans are therefore the only species to have a spiritual dimension, referred to as the 'soul'. This is the part of humans that connects with God and is the immortal, an immortal part of them that lives on in the afterlife. The soul is considered transcendent because it is believed to exist beyond the physical body and material world. The Catechism teaches Catholics that the soul is the innermost aspect and spiritual principle of the human person (CCC 362-368). This means that the soul is the core of a person's identity and existence.

Human beings are created by God to be rational beings who can use their reason and judgement to make informed decisions. Humans are expected to rule over and look after the earth (Genesis 1:26-28). They also have free will, which means they have the ability to make choices for themselves. However, when Adam and Eve disobeyed God's instruction (Genesis 2:15-17), they came to understand right and wrong but their perfect relationship with God was broken. This is called The Fall. (Genesis 3) A further consequence was that all human beings will inherit 'Original Sin' and carry this within their nature. This fallen nature means that humans are separated from God.

Suggested learning activity:

Around the outline of a human body, learners could write each key term relating to the nature of human beings, e.g. imago Dei, soul, free will, etc. They could then do a match up activity where they place brief explanations with each key term.

## The Nicene Creed

This is a statement of Christian faith formulated at the Councils of Nicaea (325 AD) and Constantinople (381 AD). The creed is recited

Key Catholic beliefs and teachings:

- the Nicene Creed
- the Lord's prayer.

{36}------------------------------------------------

The importance of the Bible:

• using the Bible as a source of wisdom and guidance – literal, conservative and liberal interpretations.

by Catholics during the Mass, and it affirms key beliefs about God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit and the Church.

## The Lord's Prayer

This prayer, also called the Our Father, is taught by Jesus in the Gospels (Matthew 6:9–13, Luke 11:2–4), and is a model for how Christians should pray. It begins by honouring God, expresses a desire for God's will to be done on earth, and asks for daily needs, forgiveness of sins, and deliverance from evil. It is both a personal and communal prayer, emphasising the believer's relationship with God and others. This prayer is always recited as part of the Mass.

Suggested learning activities:

• Text analysis: Analyse the Nicene Creed to identify key beliefs about the Trinity and the Church.

The Bible is the holy book for Christians. They believe it is a book which has been inspired by the Holy Spirit and is 'God-breathed', therefore it is an important source of wisdom and authority for Catholics. It is the revealed and inspired Word of God, so Catholics will turn to it for guidance. For example, the Ten Commandments are a list of rules for believers to abide by.

Literalists – Some Christians are called literalists and believe that every word of the Bible is literally true. For example, a literalist would believe that God created the world in six days (24-hour periods) and created a man on the sixth day and made a woman out of man's rib as this is how the first two chapters of the book of Genesis described it.

Conservative Christians – Whilst they believe that the Bible is the revealed and inspired Word of God, they consider other factors need to be considered in discovering the meaning of the Bible. Catholics believe that readers must use their intelligence, the guidance of the

{37}------------------------------------------------

The use and importance of other important texts in daily life:

- Papal encyclicals
- Catechism of the Catholic Church.

Holy Spirit and Church teachings in order to understand the writers' intentions fully. For example, in the book of Genesis, Conservative Christians may suggest that the world was created by God in six periods of time, rather than days.

Liberal Christians – They see the Bible more as a personal guide to living a life pleasing to God, rather than something to be strictly followed. They may suggest that the Bible is written about God and contains useful information to help believers understand their faith better, but that, as it was written by humans inspired by God, it could contain errors. For example, the Creation story in Genesis simply helps humans to understand that God is the Creator of the world.

Catholics will also refer to other sources of wisdom and authority when needing guidance. Papal encyclicals are formal letters or teachings issued by the Pope to address important matters of faith, morals or social issues. They are usually directed to bishops, clergy and all Catholics but can also be intended for a broader audience. Encyclicals provide guidance on applying Church doctrine to contemporary challenges and often clarify theological points, promote justice or encourage deeper spiritual reflection. While not considered infallible, they hold significant authority and contribute to the Church's ongoing teaching tradition. Examples include Laudato Si' (on the environment) and Fratelli Tutti (on social inclusion). The Catechism of the Catholic Church is a guide to Catholic faith and doctrine, presenting the Church's teachings on faith, morals, sacraments, prayer and the Ten Commandments. It aids Catholics in their understanding of what the Church teaches and celebrates.

Suggested learning activity:

- Read an extract from one of the papal encyclicals or from the Catechism and use an inference grid to explore its meaning. How might this guide a Catholic in their everyday life?
- Ask learners to create flashcards showing different ways of interpreting the Bible. Give examples of different biblical teaching

Suggested learning activity:

• Learners could take each of the Spiritual and Corporal Works of Mercy and decide how these could be shown in everyday life. How do they display faith in action?

In Acts 20:35, believers are reminded of Jesus' instruction to give rather than receive, which encourages them to support the poor and needy whenever possible.

In 2 Corinthians 9:7, St Paul emphasises the spirit in which giving should be undertaken. The act of giving is meaningful when it comes from the heart.

James 2:17 teaches that true faith is not passive; it requires action to be genuine and alive. This verse encourages believers to live out their faith in practical, observable ways, such as helping the poor.

Examples of Catholic faith in action could include: CAFOD, Missio, the Saint Vincent de Paul Society (SVP), the Catholic Association for Racial Justice (CARJ), the Caritas Social Action Network (CSAN), the National Justice and Peace Network. CAFOD:

solidarity and address the root causes of poverty and inequality in a way that respects both people and the environment. CAFOD's work is based on the principle of solidarity – the idea that all people are interconnected and should work together for the common good. CAFOD (Catholic Agency for Overseas Development) is the official international development agency of the Catholic Church in England and Wales. It works to fight poverty and promote sustainable development in the world's poorest communities. This includes providing emergency and humanitarian assistance during natural disasters and conflicts and supporting long -term development programs to address the root causes of poverty. CAFOD advocates for policies and actions that protect the rights and dignity of the poor and vulnerable. Education and advocacy are key parts of CAFOD's mission. The agency raises awareness about global poverty, injustice and the need for sustainable development. They encourage Catholics and others to become more active in advocating for social change through campaigns, lobbying and education. They also support sustainable development by helping communities build resilience against poverty and environmental challenges through programs focusing on improving agriculture, water access, healthcare and education. This aligns with the church's teaching on the care of creation and the environment. CAFOD works with local partners and communities to ensure that its programs are relevant, culturally appropriate and effective.

| 1.3.2b Catholic beliefs about life after death | Learners should understand:<br>The basis for Catholic belief in life after death:<br>• John 3:16<br>• John 11: 25-26.<br>Catholic beliefs and teachings about life after death:<br>• heaven; John 14:1-4; Catechism of the Catholic Church 1022<br>• hell; Luke 12:4-5; 2 Thessalonians 1:5-9; Catechism of the Catholic Church 1023<br>• resurrection; Luke 16:19-3; John 11:24-27; 1 Corinthians 15: 20-22 and 1 Corinthians 15: 42-44<br>• beliefs about Purgatory; Catechism of the Catholic Church 1022; 1030. | Catholics believe there is an afterlife where the soul continues after the physical death. They believe they will receive Particular (Individual) Judgement from God at their death, who will decide on their eternal destiny (CCC 1022). They also believe in General Judgement which will occur on the Last Day. This is when Jesus will return to earth, called the Parousia (Second Coming), raise all the dead to life again, and judge all people. He will separate them into two groups, the saved and the lost, based on their response to those in need. This is explained in the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats.<br>Belief in the sacrifice Jesus made for all people can bring salvation (John 3:16). In John's Gospel, Jesus made clear to his followers that belief in him was necessary for a place in heaven. (John 11:25-26)<br>heaven – Eternal union with God for those who have lived in grace and holiness (CCC 1023). There is plenty of room for all in heaven (John 14:1-4). |

{43}------------------------------------------------

purgatory – A temporary state of purification for souls not fully ready for heaven. Purgatory is not a place of judgement, but a time of preparation for those souls going to heaven (CCC 1030).

hell – Eternal separation from God for those who die in unrepented mortal sin (CCC 1033). Luke 12:4-5 reminds believers that judgement lies with God. 2 Thessalonians 1:5-9 states that God is a fair and just God and will punish those who deserve it.

resurrection – Catholics believe in the resurrection of the dead, a core teaching of the faith. They believe that all people will be resurrected at the end of time (1 Corinthians 15:20-22, CCC1038). The faithful will be raised to eternal life with God, while others face judgement. The resurrected will receive glorified, imperishable bodies, free from pain, death or decay (1 Corinthians 15:42-44). This belief provides Catholics with hope and purpose.

Luke 16:19-31 is the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus, which teaches Christians that their actions in this life will impact their place in the afterlife.

John 11:24-27 recounts the time when Jesus identifies himself as the source of both resurrection (life after death) and life in the present. Faith in Jesus grants eternal life, and through him, believers will experience resurrection.

Suggested learning activity:

• Read through the biblical text of the Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus. Discuss how the Rich Man's behaviour was unacceptable and suggest ways in which he could have behaved differently. How can this be placed into a modern-day context?

# 1.3.3b Catholic mourning and funeral practices

## Learners should understand:

The importance of mourning and funeral practices:

- committing a person's body to God
- giving thanks to God for that person's life
- celebrating and remembering the life of the deceased
- using signs and symbols to express a deeper meaning
- showing the link between this life and Catholic beliefs about the life after death.

## Catholic mourning practices:

- mass for the deceased
- prayers recited for the deceased.

## Catholic funeral practices:

- vigil service
- requiem mass
- funeral service, hymns, prayers and eulogy
- burial and the rite of committal.

Catholic funerals will always include a celebration and thanksgiving for the life of the person who has died. While it is often a sad occasion where people are grieving, there will be also be hope and trust in God. The body and the soul of the deceased is committed to God. There are symbols, prayers and readings that convey beliefs about eternal life. Catholic funerals reflect the link between this life and Catholic beliefs about life after death. For example, the service will express the hope of eternal life and the resurrection of the body on the Last Day. Catholic funerals emphasise that death is not the end, and through the mercy of God, the deceased is now at rest in God's eternal presence.

When a Catholic dies, their family and friends will often ask for Mass to be celebrated in their memory. Catholics offer Masses for the deceased to pray for the souls in purgatory, asking God to grant them purification and eternal rest in heaven. This practice is rooted in the belief in the Communion of Saints, where the living can intercede for the deceased through prayer and good works. The Mass is the highest form of prayer in Catholicism, as it represents Christ's sacrifice on the cross. Offering Masses for the dead reflects love and hope for their salvation. Additionally, special prayers are recited for the deceased, such as the 'Eternal Rest' prayer, to commend the person's soul to God's mercy and pray for their peace in eternal life.

vigil service: This usually takes place the evening before the funeral and includes the Reception of the Body. It is a short service where the body of the deceased is received into the Church, with Bible readings and prayers. The coffin is then left in the Church overnight in readiness for the funeral the following day.

requiem mass: Usually, Catholics will have their funeral as part of a Mass. There is a great deal of symbolism, which expresses beliefs about the afterlife:

{45}------------------------------------------------

Sprinkling the coffin with holy water – this is a reminder of the holy water used in Baptism.

The pall – the coffin is covered with a white cloth, a reminder of the baptism of the deceased, and that all are equal before God.

Vestments – the priest will wear white as a reminder of the Resurrection of Jesus.

Bible or Book of Gospels – this is placed on the coffin as a reminder that the deceased lived by the word of God and the teachings of Jesus.

Cross or Crucifix – this is placed on the coffin as a reminder that, through Jesus' death and resurrection, humans can gain salvation and eternal life.

Paschal Candle – this is placed beside the coffin as a symbol of belief in the Resurrection and all that it promises humans. Other candles are also used to represent Jesus as the Light of the World.

Incense is used during the Mass to honour the person, as their body was a temple of the Holy Spirit. It also represents the prayers of the people present rising up to God.

Bible readings – these will be chosen to remind those present of the promise of resurrection and eternal life and will be a source of comfort and hope for those grieving.

Eulogy – a short speech given about the deceased person, where a relative or friend speaks about and celebrates their life.

Hymns will remind the congregation of the promise of salvation and eternal life.

{46}------------------------------------------------

Burial and Rite of Committal: The body is then taken to the grave or crematorium where more prayers are said, incense might be used, and the coffin is sprinkled with holy water, and lowered into the grave. The committal prayer includes the words 'earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust', to acknowledge human mortality while affirming resurrection hope. If buried, loved ones throw handfuls of earth on to the coffin. This signifies the body's return to the earth and marks a final farewell.

## Suggested learning activity:

Catholics will<br>often express belonging to their faith community on a daily basis, for<br>example, blessing oneself with the sign of the cross, wearing a cross<br>or crucifix or carrying a rosary. Worship communities<br>provide<br>opportunities for shared prayer, participation in the sacraments<br>(especially the Eucharist), and mutual support in living out the<br>Gospel.

The Vatican is home to St. Peter's Basilica, built over the tomb of Saint Peter, the first pope. It is also the home of the current Pope, and the spiritual and administrative centre of the Catholic Church. Pilgrims may attend Mass, receive blessings from the Pope, and visit sacred sites such as the Sistine Chapel and the Vatican Museums. Many also pray at the tombs of saints, explore the history of the Church and reflect on their faith.

There are other sites of Catholic pilgrimage that could be explored, such as Our Lady of the Taper in Cardigan, Holywell, Our Lady of Penrhys in the Rhondda Valleys, and Santiago de Compostela.

## Suggested learning activity:

• Research a Catholic place of pilgrimage and create a presentation to show why believers visit there and what they might do there.

Catholics are strengthened in their life of service through the sacraments. The sacraments are essential for Catholics as they are visible signs of God's grace, instituted by Christ to sanctify believers and strengthen their relationship with God. Through the seven sacraments – baptism, confirmation, eucharist, reconciliation, anointing of the Sick, matrimony, and Holy Orders – Catholics receive divine grace, grow in holiness, and participate in the life of the Church. The sacraments mark key moments in a Catholic's spiritual journey, fostering a deeper connection with God and the community of faith.

Baptism is the first sacrament by which a person becomes a member of the Church, which originated at the baptism of Jesus. A person who is baptised is welcomed into the family of faith through the Holy Spirit. The Catholic Church usually baptises infants, although anyone

{49}------------------------------------------------

of any age can receive the sacrament. There are important symbols used within the ceremony of baptism which reflect key beliefs, including holy water, the oils of Chrism and Catechumens, the white garment, the candle and the sign of the cross.

Suggested learning activity:

• Debate – Learners could evaluate whether infants or adults should be baptised and give reasons for their views.

The Eucharist or Mass is the 'source and summit of Christian life' (CCC 1324), i.e. that it is both the foundation and the ultimate expression of Christian spiritual life. It was instituted by Jesus Christ at the Last Supper. Eucharist is a Greek word meaning 'thanksgiving' and Catholics believe it is an opportunity to celebrate and renew all that God has done through the death and resurrection of Jesus. Through the process of transubstantiation, Catholics believe that the bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ when consecrated by the priest, and only the appearances of bread and wine remain. This means that Jesus is actually present in the bread and wine and they can receive him in a personal way. Unless a Catholic has received their 'first holy communion', where they will have attended special preparation classes to fully understand the meaning of the sacrament, they are unable to receive the Eucharist. The Catholic Church also teaches that a person must be in full communion with the Church in order to receive the sacrament. The Eucharist is spiritual food for the believer and it strengthens them to carry out their mission and vocation in the world.

Suggested learning activity:

• Read a Gospel account of the Last Supper. Now, use an inference grid to explore a piece of modern art depicting the Last Supper, for example 'The Jesus Table' by Sieger Köder. What links can learners make between the art work and the Gospel account?

Confirmation is the third sacrament of initiation and is usually preceded by a time of preparation and instruction in the faith. Confirmation allows a person to renew the vows made at baptism and to take on their Christian commitment for themselves. It is usually carried out by the bishop of the diocese, and Chrism oil is once again used in the ceremony as a reminder of the person's baptism. The bishop will perform the 'laying on of hands', an ancient sign to symbolise the coming down and entering of a person by the Holy Spirit, full of power and courage. Suggested learning activity: • Explore the vows made by a confirmation candidate and identify what the vows mean and how they can be lived out in everyday life. 1.4.2b Catholicism and morality Learners should understand: Catholic beliefs and teachings about how to make moral decisions: • obeying divine commands such as the Ten Commandments; Exodus 20:1-17 • St. Thomas Aquinas' Natural Law – the 5 primary precepts • the Bible as a source of morality: Christian love (agape): Luke 10:25-37; Luke 13:34-35; forgiveness: Matthew 6:12; Matthew 18:21-22; Luke 23:34 and Matthew 5:43-44 • the use of conscience to make moral decisions; 2 Corinthians 1:12. For Catholics, defining 'right' or 'wrong' is directly linked to their faith. This means that deciding what is right and wrong is linked to the teachings of Christ, the teachings of the Church, the will of God, natural law and the order in the universe. Any act or action that goes against the will of God can be defined as 'wrong'. Catholics use their conscience, faith, the Bible and Church teaching when making important decisions and deciding if an act is right or wrong. Catholics believe that God has given them guidelines to help them understand morally right behaviour. For example, the Ten Commandments, or Decalogue, are found in the Old Testament (Exodus 20:1-17) and form the basis of all moral behaviour. Catholics will look to Mary, Mother of God, as an example and witness of hope, faith and love. (CCC 64, 148-149, 964). The Beatitudes are teachings by Jesus found in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:3-12), that describe the attitudes and qualities of a life blessed by God. They highlight the virtues of humility, mercy, justice, and faith, showing the path to true happiness and eternal life.

- Preservation of life – The duty to protect and sustain human life.
- Reproduction – The natural drive to continue human existence through procreation.
- Education – The responsibility to educate and care for one's children.
- Seeking God – The obligation to worship and seek a relationship with God.
- Living in society – The need to work for the common good and cooperate with others.

The basis of Jesus' teachings is love. The word Jesus uses for 'love' comes from the Greek word 'agapè' and refers to the love God has for humans and the type of unselfish, compassionate love humans should show to others. This is illustrated in the Parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25 -37). For Catholics, this unconditional love means putting the well -being of others before your own. Catholics believe that Jesus' sacrifice on the cross was an ultimate example of agap è .

In Luke 13:34 -35, Jesus is distressed due to the lack of love being shown among the people. He warns them of the consequences of this behaviour.

Suggested learning activities:

• Evaluate which is the most important source of morality for Catholics. For example, the Bible, Jesus' example, conscience, Church teaching.

{52}------------------------------------------------

• Ask learners to create a short video, TikTok or slideshow retelling the parable of the Good Samaritan in their own words or in a modern setting. Share and discuss the videos, focusing on how each retelling conveys the core message of the parable.

Forgiveness is an important concept, and Jesus refers to it many times, e.g. in parables, when asked questions about how his followers should behave , and even when he was being put to death (Luke 23:34). Jesus teaches that God is forgiving but that forgiveness of humans depends on whether people are willing and able to forgive others. This idea is referred to in the Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:12). Forgiveness is challenging for believers, but Jesus extends the idea even further and links it to the notion of 'loving your enemy'. (Matthew 5:43 -44). In the Catholic Church people can seek forgiveness as often as they need to through the Sacrament of Reconciliation.

Suggested learning activity:

• Research case studies on forgiveness and give reasons why the person involved could/could not forgive.

Some examples can be found here: [Examples of personal](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z2b36yc/revision/8)  forgiveness - Forgiveness - [GCSE Religious Studies Revision](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z2b36yc/revision/8)  - WJEC - [BBC Bitesize](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z2b36yc/revision/8)

The word conscience comes from the Latin words con meaning 'with' and 'scientia ' meaning 'knowledge'. Catholics believe that conscience is a God -given ability to know the difference between right and wrong (2 Corinthians 1:12 ) and part of being created imago Dei. While conscience is God's law written on the heart, Catholics believe they must make an effort to inform or educate their conscience so that they hear God's law when they are reflecting on

{53}------------------------------------------------

Morality and Divine judgement in the afterlife:

- treasures on earth and in Heaven; Matthew 6:19-21 and Luke 16:19-31
- future judgement based on earthly actions; Matthew 25:31-46 - Parable of the Sheep and the Goats
- Catechism of the Catholic Church 1022.

their moral choices. The Church teaches that informing conscience is something that Catholics need to put effort into during their whole lifetime.

As part of his moral teachings, Jesus spoke about how someone could be rewarded for their good actions and likened the reward to treasure in heaven (Matthew 6:19-21). He taught that doing good deeds was like making deposits into a spiritual treasury, where it is secure, safe from being stolen, losing value or being destroyed (Luke 16:19-31).

In the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats, Jesus taught about General Judgement, which will take place on the Last Day. Jesus will return to earth in his Second Coming, or Parousia, and will judge all people according to their response to those in need while on earth (Matthew 25:31-46).

Catholics also believe they will receive Individual Judgement at the moment of their death. God will judge their earthly actions and decide if they will spend all eternity in heaven or hell. Many souls spend time in purgatory as a place of cleansing from sin before going to heaven.

Suggested learning activity:

• Read the Parable of the Sheep and the Goats and make a list of the expectations of those who will be sent to heaven/hell.

Moral evil – This is suffering caused by human beings. Examples could include murder, rape, theft, violence, lying. Natural evil – This is suffering caused by natural events. Examples could include earthquakes, flooding, drought, hurricanes and tsunamis.

{54}------------------------------------------------

Learners should have a basic understanding of:

- what is meant by the problem of evil what is meant by moral evil (caused by humans) and natural evil (caused by nature)
- the philosophical challenges posed by belief in God and the existence of evil and suffering - the inconsistent triad
- what a theodicy is, and how the Irenaean (soulmaking) and Augustinian (soul-deciding) theodicies attempt to address the problem of evil.

Suggested learning activity:

• Research case studies of evil and suffering and decide if they are examples of moral or natural evil.

The presence of evil in the world sometimes causes people to question God's existence. JL Mackie identified the 'inconsistent triad', where he suggested that the following three (triad) things are inconsistent as they cannot all be true at the same time:

He said that if God is omnipotent (all-powerful) and omni-benevolent (all-loving), then evil would not exist. However, we have experienced evil and know that it exists. Therefore, either God is not all-powerful because he cannot stop suffering, or he is not all-loving because he doesn't want to stop suffering. This dilemma is called the Problem of Evil.

Suggested learning activity:

• Draw a diagram to represent the Inconsistent Triad.

The word theodicy comes from two Greek terms: Theos – God and Dike – Justice. A theodicy attempts to justify the existence of an omnipotent and omni-benevolent God in the light of the existence of evil.

Two early Church Fathers put forward their theodicies to try to explain the problem of evil. These are Saint Augustine and Saint Irenaeus.

Saint Augustine believed that suffering was the fault of humans and angels who used their free will to turn away from God. Humans and angels are to blame for the suffering in the world not God. Augustine taught that God gives humans the chance to be forgiven for sin through Jesus's death on the cross. If humans turn back to God, then they will be in heaven (Soul-deciding theodicy).

{55}------------------------------------------------

between the two theodicies mentioned above.

|  | Saint Irenaeus believed that God made mankind in his 'image to grow into his likeness'. God allows humans to suffer so that humans grow to be more like him. God has given humans free will and we can make good or bad choices. Irenaeus believed that all humans will be in heaven (Soul-making theodicy).<br>Suggested learning activity:<br>• Create a Venn diagram to show the similarities and differences |

{57}------------------------------------------------

The three sections of the Eightfold Path:

- wisdom (panna) right understanding, right intention
- morality (sila) right speech, right action, right livelihood
- meditation (samadhi) right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.

- think will make them happy. What happens when that item doesn't make them happy?
- Draw a chart with three headings: mental and physical pain, feelings of dissatisfaction, inability to accept change. Under each heading, give as many examples as possible.
- Consider the quote "All of life is suffering" and explain what the Buddhists mean by this. Add own thoughts about the inevitability of suffering.
- Create own learning mat of the Four Noble Truths. Include a glossary that defines the terms dukkha, tanha, nirodha and magga.

The Eightfold Path is split into three sections. There are no natural starting and end points, ideally Buddhists are engaging in all three sections at the same time.

## **Wisdom**

Right understanding refers to an acceptance of Buddhist teachings and realising their influence on daily life.

Right intention means doing things for the right reason. For Buddhists, thinking as well as action results in karma. Thinking negatively (e.g. hatred, greed and envy) will affect actions in a negative way. Purifying the mind of hatred, greed and envy will result in positive actions and an end to suffering. According to the law of karma, thoughts as well as actions have consequences.

#### **Morality**

Right speech means speaking in a way that has a positive impact so no lying, swearing or gossiping.

Right action means acting in a way that is positive and doesn't cause harm e.g. not killing or injuring any living being (ahimsa), not stealing, not being unfaithful.

{58}------------------------------------------------

Right livelihood is choosing a job that is not harmful to others e.g., not selling weapons, meat, slaves or harmful drugs.

## **Meditation**

Right effort is developing positive ways of thinking e.g. humble, generous or compassionate thoughts.

Right mindfulness means to have a calm and peaceful state of mind. These qualities can be developed through right concentration (meditation practices).

## Suggested Learning Activities:

- Quiz Quiz Trade to familiarise pupils with the eight steps and their meanings. Produce some cards with questions relating to each of the eight steps (e.g. What is meant by Right Livelihood). Other cards will have the answers to the questions (e.g. To ensure that Buddhists have jobs that do not harm themselves or others). Distribute cards to pupils who then walk around the classroom, asking their question to all they meet. The pupil with an answer card tells them their answer. When someone with a question card meets the person with the correct answer, they can 'bank' this and choose another question/answer card. They will come across the same questions and answers a number of times, so will become familiar with the information.
- Think of characters from soap operas/films who did not follow right speech, right action or right livelihood. Consider the impact of this on their lives and relationships.
- Look at each of the three sections in turn – analyse which section could be the most important to a Buddhist. Give reasons and make a judgement.
- Create a TikTok video summary, explaining the Eightfold Path, including the eight steps and their meanings.

{59}------------------------------------------------

The Three Marks of Existence (Lakshanas):

- anicca the concept of impermanence (Dhammapada 20)
- anatta the concept of no permanent self, using the Story of Nagasena and the Chariot as an example of the idea of the Five Skandhas (Dhammapada 113 and 279)
- dukkha dissatisfaction arising from an inability to accept anicca and anatta (Dhammacakkapayattana Sutta).

These are the features that exist in everyone's life:

- Nothing in life is permanent (anicca) so everything in the universe is in a state of flux.
- There is nothing about a person that is permanent (anatta) due to the idea of people being made up of Five Skandhas which change throughout a person's life. Buddhists do not believe in a permanent soul that can move on to a new rebirth. The example of Nagasena and the Chariot is used to show that the separate individual parts do not make the chariot.
- Everyone experiences dukkha (suffering, dissatisfaction, unsatisfactoriness) as a result of everything and everyone changing. This links in the with the Noble Truths. Through following the Eightfold Path (magga), Buddhists can overcome wanting (tanha) things to be permanent and can end suffering (nirodha).

Buddhist beliefs and teachings about the Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama):

- early life: pre-birth, birth, prediction, life in palace
- Four Sights: old age, sickness, death, holy man
- renunciation: leaving palace, becoming ascetic
- Enlightenment: seeing the world as it really is
- revelation of the Dharma (Samyutta Nikaya)

- [Pass and Play](https://resource.download.wjec.co.uk/vtc/2016-17/16-17_2-36/pdf/_eng/unit1/8-pass-and-play-suffering.pdf) activity. Complete the main task and the Challenge Yourself activity. If you decide to use the Extension Task you will need to change the rubric to fit the new specification.
- Persuasive writing task: produce a leaflet showing the relevance of dukkha, anicca and anatta in the 21st century

Stories about the pre-birth and birth events are meant to illustrate the uniqueness of the Buddha. The prediction made highlights the belief that he was destined to become enlightened in this lifetime: many Buddhists believe that Gautama was a bodhisattva (buddha-to-be) in a previous life. His life in the palace highlights the blinkered world people live in before they accept things as they really are.

The Four Sights are the catalyst for Gautama leaving behind his past life. Seeing old age, sickness and death made him realise the lakshanas – everything changes (anicca), there is no permanent self (anatta) and everyone suffers.

Renunciation is important for all people who want to follow the teachings of the Buddha. Some people become monks so might give up their home and live more regimented lives, but extreme ascetism is not a feature of Buddhism. Lay people might renounce their previous way of life or beliefs when they become a Buddhist.

Buddha is viewed as an inspiration to people who believe that they, too, can become enlightened.

After attaining Enlightenment, Buddha decided to share his dharma (teachings) with others. For many Buddhists this shows his unselfish nature in trying to help others in trying to experience the ineffable nature of enlightenment.

(The Life of the Buddha animation by Iathrios, YouTube)<br>• The first activity might be too basic for some pupils so it might be more suitable to move on the Extension Tasks and the Questions to Consider (WJEC).<br>• Use a search engine to find pictures that illustrate the main aspects of the Buddha's life. Write short descriptions of what can be seen in each picture, making sure they are in chronological order.<br>• Analyse and evaluate which part of the Buddha's life was most important (i.e. his birth or life in the palace or the Four Sights or renunciation or being an ascetic or Enlightenment).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 1.5.2a<br>Buddhist belief in action | Learners should understand:<br>Key Buddhist beliefs and teachings:<br>• dana: generous giving (Ittivuttaka 26)<br>• karuna: compassion due to all living things being interdependent<br>• metta: loving-kindness. "My religion is very simple, My religion is kindness." (Dalai Lama). | Bhikkhus (monks) are reliant on dana (generosity) from lay people whose donations help with the upkeep of monasteries and with food for monks. A lay person gains merit (punya) when giving dana. It is the donor who thanks the recipient for giving them the opportunity to accrue positive karma.<br>Karuna is an attitude to others that relies on recognising that everyone suffers and are connected.<br>Metta (loving-kindness) is about respect for the lives of others and showing that respect by being kind and considerate. During loving-kindness meditation (mettabhavana) Buddhists try to cultivate feelings of kindness for all beings.<br>Suggested Learning Activities:<br>• Pass the Mind-Map – give each pupil a sheet of paper and a coloured pen/pencil. In the middle of the sheet write dana or karuna or metta (these words can be used on multiple sheets). When activity starts each learner must write a fact/key point/keyword/example/information about that topic. Then they swap with someone close by. Keep doing this until all pupils have written on more than 5 sheets. |

Contemporary local or national examples of Buddhist faith and belief in action – community work and faith-based activism.

How the aims and work of the Karuna Trust reflect Buddhist beliefs in action.

• Direct learners to re-read the comments and add a justification/opposition to any one of them. When the sheet returns to the first person, they can question the person who has made a judgement. Listen to the judgements made, vote on the strongest/most relevant.

Samye Foundation Wales is a mindfulness centre based in Cardiff. They are involved in the [Mother Earth Group.](https://sfwales.org/environmental-project/mother-earth-group-project/)

[Lam Rim Centre](https://www.lamrimcentre.org.uk/environment) is a retreat centre at Raglan, Usk. They are involved in environmental issues.

[SGI-UK](https://sgi-uk.org/) is Buddhism in action for peace. They are also involved in climate change issues. They have small groups across Wales, which can be found by entering an area at [https://sgi-uk.org/Local-Community.](https://sgi-uk.org/Local-Community)

Karuna (also known as the Karuna Trust) is a small group of Buddhists in the UK who fundraise to help ease the suffering of communities in India. They put Buddhist practices in action – actively showing karuna (compassion), living according to the principles of right livelihood with an ethical purpose and providing a framework for spiritual practice. They also aim for their work to be economically and globally sustainable.

## Suggested Learning Activities:

- Choose one of the groups above (Samye Foundation Wales, Lam Rim Centre or SGI-UK). Research their beliefs, teachings and actions. Produce a one-sided information sheet/infographic
- Work in groups of 3 (or groups of 4 or more so that less confident learners can work together). Go to the website of Karuna (the Karuna Trust) [https://karuna.org.](https://karuna.org/) Scroll down to the section called 3 Areas of Focus (Education for All, Sustainable Livelihoods, Gender Equality). Allocate one area to one member of the group to focus on. Read through the information on the webpage and make notes in preparation for a speaking task. At the end of the allocated time, each member of the group talks about their focus.

Suffering<br>can be interpreted in many ways including dissatisfaction and<br>unsatisfactoriness. Most instances of suffering might be minor niggles<br>that affect daily life. Even times of happiness (sukkha), are tainted by<br><b>dukkha</b> as life might not be exactly what people want.

Buddhists do not believe in a permanent soul that moves on from one life to another, so is different from reincarnation. For them, consciousness (one of the Five Precepts) that has been conditioned by karma is reborn into the cycle of samsara.

Popular metaphors used to explain causation and rebirth include:

- the flame of a candle being used to light a new candle yet they are not the same flame;
- the relationship between milk and yogurt; yogurt is dependent on milk, but they are not the same product.
- a film strip appears to be continuous action yet if slowed to each individual still, one moment disappears and the next appears. Each

still is dependent on the one that came before and influences the one that comes next.

Nirvana is the state of peace and joy that happens once one has achieved nirodha (ended craving). To achieve nirvana, Buddhists need to put the teachings of the Buddha (dharma) into action and overcome the Three Poisons (greed, hatred, ignorance). The Buddha achieved nirvana at his enlightenment. Achieving nirvana does not mean that a person's life ends nor that the person feels nothing afterwards: it is a state of peace and happiness.

The Tibetan Wheel of Life sets out the different realms of existence in samsara. It is a visual way to show how each existence is dependent on the previous one. It also shows how craving (tanha) leads to the cycle of samsara starting again.

Triratna is a form of Western Buddhism which has adapted beliefs from more traditional forms of Buddhism. They put forward the idea that rebirth happens throughout someone's life through the development of insight and the death of the idea of a permanent self, a person is reborn spiritually. Rebirth happens every day because everyone and everything is constantly changing (anicca) so no -one remains the same person throughout their life.

## Suggested Learning Activities:

- Listen to a Buddhist monk explain rebirth [\(What is rebirth? By SGC\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-AgbeYnZN0).
- What happens/what happens next activity. Give pupils certain scenarios – they decide whether it leads to positive, negative or neutral karma. They think about what might happen as a result, and whether it is positive, neutral or negative. Examples of scenarios could be you lie too long in the sun, you have toothache, but don't go to the dentist, you tidy your bedroom without being asked, you hit someone at school, you cook your family a meal, you help an elderly person across the road.

A monk visits the family's home 6 days after the funeral to give a sermon about anicca (impermanence). This shows that death is just a stage in the cycle of samsara and that the deceased might be reborn.

Be aware that many websites and online videos use the term 'reincarnation' when referring to Buddhist belief in life after death. The correct term is 'rebirth' as Buddhists do not believe that there is a permanent self or soul that is born into a new body.

## Suggested Learning Activities:

- Quiz Quiz Trade to familiarise pupils with the various mourning and funeral practices. Produce some cards with questions relating to mourning and funeral practices (e.g. Why is scented water sprinkled on the hand of the deceased?) Other cards will have the answers to the questions (e.g. To symbolise the transfer of merit). Distribute cards to pupils who then walk around the classroom, asking their question to all they meet. The pupil with an answer card tells them their answer. When someone with a question card meets the person with the correct answer, they can 'bank' this and choose another question/answer card. They will come across the same questions and answers a number of times, so will become familiar with the information.
- Describe and explain the importance of the mourning and funeral practices.
- Post -It Notes – pupils answer any 3 of the following prompts: 2 things I'd like to know more about, 1 thing I know now that I didn't know before, 2 things I will definitely remember, 1 thing that surprised me, 2 questions I'd like to ask, 1 way I could improve my work, 2 sentences that would summarise this lesson. Stick them into book/folder and re -visit at the end of the next section.

Buddhist mourning and funeral practices:

- Mahayana mourning and funeral practices Japanese and Tibetan
- Japanese practices chanting, giving the deceased a new name, cremating the body and burying the ashes
- Tibetan practices use of the Tibetan Book of the Dead, cremation, sky burial, giving offerings and offering food to the deceased
- Theravada mourning and funeral practices monks chanting, sprinkling water, tying the deceased's hands and feet, placing monks' robes on the coffin and cremation.

There are different schools within Buddhism. Theravada (Tradition of the Elders) is the most traditional and generally found in South Asia. Mahayana (the Great School) tends to be more universal and more likely to be found in eastern Asian countries. Tibetan Buddhism is sometimes placed under the Mahayana umbrella but has many unique beliefs and practices.

Generally, Mahayana practices are like those of Theravada Buddhists. Mourners chant for 7 days, then weekly for 7 weeks. It is believed that it takes 49 days for the deceased's karma to be channelled into their rebirth.

Japanese practices include the priest leading mourners in chanting a passage from the Buddhist teachings. The deceased is given a new name to prevent them from returning to earth any time their name is called. The body is cremated which symbolises freeing the spirit from the body and allowing it to transition to another world. Special chopsticks are used to sift through the bones which can be seen as gathering luck, strength, wisdom or healing. These are then placed into an urn which will be buried, giving family members a place to pay their respects.

Tibetan practices include using the Book of the Dead which is often read to the person who is dying and explains the stages that they will go through on their journey to the next life. The time between one life and the next (bardo) can take a moment or up to 49 days. The Book of the Dead sets out how a person's karma determines what their next life might be like, showing that their own actions lead the to the type of life they will have in the future. Tibetan funerals might be a cremation or a sky burial, where the body is taken to a place on a mountain. The body is cut into pieces and fed to vultures as a symbol of impermanence (anicca) and how all things are dependent on each other (interrelatedness).

Chanting is when Buddhists repeat a mantra such as '*Om mani padme hum'* ('Praise to the jewel of the Lotus') which can be chanted to develop compassion and wisdom, or '*Nam myoho renge kyo'* ('I take refuge in the Lotus') which might be used to overcome difficulties in life. The 'Lotus' is the Lotus Sutra – a Mahayana scripture. They might also chant the Triratna to align with the Buddha, dharma and sangha.

Malas are like prayer beads and are used when chanting to help Buddhists concentrate. The number of beads is usually symbolic.

Mantras are chants (see above).

Mandalas are intricate designs that are often made with sand or rice and can be an aid to concentration and mindfulness. Once the mandala has been completed it is destroyed to remind them that everything is impermanent (anicca).

Buddhist identity and belonging expressed through symbolic actions – pilgrimage.

Possible reasons for completing pilgrimage:

- showing respect to the Buddha for his dharma and example
- learning more about Buddhas and Bodhisattvas by visiting sites associated with their lives.

Many Buddhists might take part in pilgrimage, but it is not obligatory. It is seen as part of puja (worship). They might visit as an individual or as part of a group, but it is a way of expressing their belief in the central role of Buddha.

During the last discourse before his death, Buddha suggested that going on a pilgrimage could be a way to make spiritual development. Ananda, the Buddha's chief follower, was worried that the community would find it challenging to maintain their faith without the Buddha. The Buddha's advice was to visit specific places that had been associated with him in order to help them practice as if he was still living with them. During pilgrimage, Buddhists aim to deepen their connection, devotion and commitment to the Buddha and his teachings (dharma). For Buddhists making the journey to a place of pilgrimage is an act of taking refuge in the Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha) by deepening their connection to the Buddha and his teachings, and the community (sangha) which works to be enlightened. Pilgrimage also offers the opportunity to purify karma, cultivate merit and connect with other pilgrims. Buddhists might undertake a pilgrimage at Wesak or Parinirvana Day as these days celebrate important times in the life and death of the Buddha.

When undertaking a pilgrimage, Buddhists will visit and pay homage to sacred sites or relics dedicated to Buddha or a Bodhisattva. During the pilgrimage, Buddhists will often walk around and prostrate in front of statues. One of the aims of pilgrimage is to lessen arrogance and bring their body and mind into harmony. They will pay respect to the Buddha and bodhisattva by making offerings, chanting mantras and meditating. The Buddha and bodhisattvas aid meditation by providing a focus to concentrate on, act as inspiration, and guidance. Buddha rupas (images of Buddha or bodhisattva) are used to depict various aspects of the Budda's life or symbols of Buddhist teachings e.g., an image of Buddha with elongated ear lobes represent his life as a prince, while an image with a top-knot shows his wisdom and his enlightenment. Hand gestures (mudras) symbolise aspects of his teachings. At Mahayana sites, there

{74}------------------------------------------------

The role, significance and features of the following sites of Buddhist pilgrimage:

- Bodh Gaya
- Lumbini.

might be images of bodhisattvas (beings who have attained enlightenment but who aim to help others also achieve it). Their rupas tend to emphasise qualities of compassion. In China, pilgrims visit mountain sites that are associated with different bodhisattvas; in Japan pilgrims can visit the Daibutsu (Great Buddha), a statue of the bodhisattva Amida who is believed to have created the Pure Land, a place where they believe they can go in the next life to follow the dharma and attain enlightenment.

Bodh Gaya is believed to be the site where Buddha was enlightened. The temple at Bodh Gaya is a UNESCO World Heritage Site as it is seen to have both religious and architectural value. Buddhists visit as part of their religious discipline and to express their religious devotion.

Lumbini is believed to be the site where Gautama was born. Pilgrims perform rituals at the sight e.g., circumambulation (walking around the temple), meditation, chanting, making offerings. The pilgrimage can unite Buddhists in their spiritual journey and allow them to feel closer to their religion and the Buddha.

# 1.7.2a Buddhism and morality

Learners should understand:

Buddhist beliefs and teachings about how to make moral decisions:

- the Five Precepts as basic rules for everyday life
- avoidance of the Three Poisons greed, ignorance and hatred
- the Six Paramitas (perfections) generosity, morality, patience, energy, meditation and wisdom.

The connection between karma, rebirth and morality in Buddhism.

The Five Precepts are guidelines for all Buddhists (lay and monastic). Links can be made with the Morality section of the Eightfold Path e.g. first precept with right action, fourth precept with right speech. Some people see the Precepts as actions that Buddhists should not do, while other people see them as promoting positive behaviour e.g. not taking what has not been given can mean 'do not steal' but could also be promoting honesty and integrity.

The Three Poisons can be overcome by following the dharma. They are depicted at the centre of the Wheel of Life (pig as ignorance. cockerel as greed, snake as hatred) to show how these three characteristics drive samsara and rebirth into a world of suffering. It is only when a Buddhist overcomes these 'poisons' that they can be enlightened and escape samsara.

The [Six Paramitas](https://www.lionsroar.com/buddhism/six-perfections-paramitas/) are the foundation of Mahayana Buddhism. They are the essential qualities that need to be cultivated on the path to enlightenment. Although they are 'perfections', a Buddhist does not need to be perfect to practice them. They promote qualities of loving-kindness, compassion, honesty, integrity, being calm and composed, overcoming bad habits, meditative concentration, and seeing things as they really are.

There are lots of connections within Buddhism. Developing morality (through following the Eightfold Path, the Five Precepts and the Six Paramitas) allows a Buddhist to accrue good merit or karma. Positive karma leads to a better rebirth which allows a Buddhist to get closer to their aim of nirvana/enlightenment and freedom from the cycle of samsara.

Suggested Learning Activities:

- Play a game of cause and effect [action and karma](https://resource.download.wjec.co.uk/vtc/2016-17/16-17_2-5/pdf/action-and-karma.pdf) (WJEC).
- Think of a favourite character from a reality TV programme. Write their name at the centre of a page. Around their name, jot down the names of other characters that they are linked with (friends, in a

{76}------------------------------------------------

- relationship with etc.) Now indicate any of their relationships that have been affected by greed, hatred or ignorance – use different colours to represent each of the three poisons. In bold writing, note the results of these 'poisons'.
- Draw a chart with three columns. The first column contains each of the Five Precepts (to abstain from taking life, to abstain from taking what is not given, to abstain from sexual misconduct, to abstain from false speech, to abstain from intoxicants that cloud the mind). In the second column, write what each means e.g., to not kill etc. In the third column, list the precept as a positive action e.g., treat all living beings with kindness.
- Read through the information on the [Six Paramitas.](https://www.lionsroar.com/buddhism/six-perfections-paramitas/) Draw out a spider diagram to show what each one is, and what it entails.
- Print out a [sheet of hexagons](https://pamhook.com/solo-apps/hexagon-generator/) for pupils to write in a number of key concepts from across the course or set up one for the class. Cut out and give out for solo/pair/group work. Pupils to group hexagons together according to the connections they can make. They can move the hexagons as many times as they want as they realise the connectedness of aspects of the course.

There are two<br>main traditions of Vaishnavism and Shaivism. There are clear<br>differences with the gods they follow, the way they worship and some<br>of their practices. It would also be useful for learners to be aware<br>that<br>Hinduism is different in many ways to other religions as it is a lifestyle<br>that was practiced in the Indus Valley region which was given the<br>name Hinduism by the Western world. It is the main religion followed<br>in India with many of its beliefs and practices incorporated into daily<br>life.<br>•<br>Learners will need to understand the nature of God (Brahman) for<br>Hindus. They will need to be aware that there are many<br>teachings and beliefs about the nature of Brahman and they are<br>recorded in a range of their Holy books including the Upanishads,<br>Puranas<br>and the Bhagavad Gita.<br>•<br>They will need to understand what the Brihadaranyaka<br>Upanishad has to say about the nature of Brahman. The<br>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is one of the oldest Upanishads and<br>focused on the nature of reality and the identity of the atman<br>(self). It states that Brahman exists but is yet unknowable as it<br>has not qualities and characteristics. It is based on the concept of<br>"neti-neti" (not this not that). This Upanishad also shows that<br>although there are many deities (gods) with individual qualities,<br>they are all aspects of Brahman, there is only one true God,<br>Brahman. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (391) describe the<br>nature of many possible deities and how they relate to different<br>aspects of Brahman. This is told through a conversation between<br>Vidagdha and Yajnavalkya<br>often known as 'the three and three<br>thousand gods'. |

The use and importance of sacred texts in daily life:

• the Upanishads and the Vedas.

- Learners will need to understand that the Katha Upanishad and the Chandogya Upanishad speak of Brahman as universal soul or spirit, source of all life and in all things. They emphasise that Brahman is everywhere (Katha Upanishad 5.2) and that all life comes from, is sustained by and goes back to Brahman. As a result of this a person should meditate and consider what they desire in life (Chandogya Upanishad 3:14.1).
- Hindus see Brahman as the Ultimate Reality often known as Bhagavan.
- There are two ways of seeing Brahman either as Nirguna or Saguna Brahman. Nirguna Brahman means that Brahman is outside time and space, Brahman has no form and is present within all living things. Whereas Saguna Brahman, means Brahman with a form, identity and purpose which can vary. Hindus who believe in Saguna Brahman make use of the deities to help them understand Brahman.
- The nature and role of the Trimurti is important for learners to understand:
  - Brahma the creator god who represents the creation of the universe and the source of all creation.
  - Vishnu the preserver and protector god who sustains the creation until it can no longer be sustained.
  - Shiva the destroyer god who destroys the universe when it no longer can be maintained for Brahma to re-create it.
  - The Kurma Purana talks about the creation of the universe and the roles of the Trimurti within it.
- Learners will need to understand the importance of the concept of the avatar within the Vaishnavite tradition of Hinduism. Vishnu is the god that is associated with avatars. He has a total of 10 avatars which come to the earth to help humanity at time of great need. The Bhagavad Gita focuses on Krishna as an avatar of Vishnu in a conversation with Arjuna on the need to fulfil one's duty above all else. As part of this Krishna emphasises that he is

{79}------------------------------------------------

an incarnation of Brahman and attempts to help Arjuna with his understanding of Brahman (Bhagavad Gita 4.5., 7 -8). Learners will need a clear understanding of two of the avatars of Brahman:

- Rama (the perfect man)
- Krishna (the Divine Statesman)
- Learners will need to understand the importance of other gods and goddesses. These are noted as:
  - The goddess Durga the protective mother of the universe
  - The god Ganesh the remover of obstacles and god of prosperity and wisdom
  - The goddess Lakshmi – the goddess of wealth, fortune and prosperity.
- Learners will also need to understand the beliefs and teachings about the relationship between Brahman and the atman. They will need to understand that the atman is unchanging, indestructible and eternal and all atman's are identical for all living things (Advaita Vedanta). To assist with this, learners can make use of stories such as, the salt and the water story which explains just like salt in water, it is there but you cannot see it. The atman is in every living thing.
- Learners will also need to understand that the atman is Brahman's creation and that Brahman is all -knowing and all powerful, but the atman is distinct from Brahman. Advaita Vedanta recognises that the atman and Brahman are separate from each other and non -interchangeable. Brahman is superior to the atman and is perfect in all aspects. Brahman's atman is independent and all other atmans depend on Brahman.
- How Hindus make use of and the importance of their sacred texts in daily life. Consideration here needs to be given to the Upanishads and the Vedas. Learners could consider:
  - How are they used in worship?

How the aims and work Sewa International reflect Hindu beliefs in action.

- karma yoga: selfless action. The concept of action without any attachment to the result of the action.
- seva: selfless service. Hindus should give selflessly without expectation of reward because it is the right things to do.
- Hindus due to their belief in ahimsa (non-violence) will often support environmental charities, as well as looking after people and animals.
- The aim is not to collect good karma by showing charity but instead to gain good karma because of showing charity.
- Learners may like to explore local Welsh and national examples of Hindu faith in action, which may include local mandir (Temples), who run food banks or provide meals to those in their local community. Further examples could include organising clothes banks, cleaning up local areas, sharing food given as darshan (gifts from Brahman), opening their kitchens to feed to homeless, or arranging community actions and events to bring people together. Learners could also look at examples of people in their local Welsh community or nationally who have worked for justice and fairness in society. Consideration could be given to the work of the Hare Krishna Movement in Wales [Home | Tŷ](https://www.tykrishna.cymru/)  [Krishna Cymru | Wellbeing Centre Cardiff](https://www.tykrishna.cymru/) and the UK Bhaktivedanta Manor – [Hare Krishna Temple Watford –](https://www.krishnatemple.com/) A [Spiritual Sanctuary,](https://www.krishnatemple.com/) also [Skanda Vale.](https://www.skandavale.org/)
- Sewa International is an example of Hindu belief in action. [Sewa](https://sewainternational.org/)  [International -](https://sewainternational.org/) Home. Learners need to have an understanding of the aims and work of this organisation. Their mission is to serve humanity and aid local communities and promote volunteering. They are a not-for-profit organisation that want equality for all.

The final aim of Hindus is to achieve moksha and to break the cycle of reincarnation.<br><br>Learners should understand that there are four aims of human life for Hindus:<br>dharma – moral duty. Every Hindu has a moral duty to act in accordance with their varna (cast) and ashrama (stage in life). Hindus believe that they should live their lives in such a way that they are considering their moral choices and always making the best decisions. They should not carry out another person's dharma, it is better to do their own dharma badly than someone else's well.kama – worldly pleasure. Every Hindu should take pleasure in the natural world, art, food and sexuality. This is used to show respect to others and to respect what Brahman has created. They always remember that Brahman is within every living thing meaning that everything deserves respect.artha – wealth and power. This focuses on gaining wealth and power through employment. It is important that they have legal employment and can afford to support and sustain their family.<br>This aim is of great importance to men when they are in the Grihastha ashrama (householder stage of life).moksha – spiritual liberation and release from the cycle of samsara. This is the ultimate aim of every Hindu. To achieve this, they will work at gaining good karma by being morally good and showing devotion to Brahman. Hindus accept that they will face multiple reincarnations before they hope of achieving moksha. |

As part<br>of their beliefs in ahimsa (non-violence) a Hindu would avoid<br>purposefully using violence to avoid bad karma. Additionally, Hindus<br>would try to act and think without desire of success or reward in<br>order to gain good karma and a better reincarnation in future lives.          |

Learners should understand the concept of samsara and recognise that all living things must die but are born again into another living thing until it can break the cycle and achieve moksha. It is known as the process of life, death and re-birth.

Learners should understand how moksha is seen and understood by Hindus. Once the atman is one and is beyond pleasure and pain then the atman joins Brahman and achieves moksha. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4.3–6. states that through desirelessness a Hindu can achieve liberation. The desirelessness that is spoken of here is knowledge of sruti or shrurti (heard) texts, meaning knowledge of the self (the atman). By achieving this, Hindus gain spiritual liberation from the cycle of samsara.

## Suggested learning activities:

- Learners can use the teachings listed to identify what each quote is saying about what Hindus believe about life, death and reincarnation.
- Learners could create a flow chart diagram of the process that Hindus believe of life, death and re-birth samsara.
- Learners could explore the idea of collecting karma and its effect on reincarnation and create images to summarise the difference between collecting good and bad karma.

# 1.6.3b Hindu practices

## Learners should understand:

The importance of mourning and funeral practices:

- using signs and symbols to express a deeper meaning
- showing the link between this life and a future life
- remembering that death is not the end of life, but a stage of life between existence and reincarnation
- celebrating and remembering the life of the deceased.

Hindu mourning practices:

- Tarpana
- the Shraddha period.

Hindu funeral practices:

- Antyesti
- Pinda Daan.

Learners should understand what rituals a Hindu will perform when someone dies and appreciate the link between these and Hindu beliefs about life, death and reincarnation. They need to be aware of how these traditions would differ in India to outside of India.

When a Hindu dies it is important that the funeral rites, antyesti, are carried out as quickly as possible to release the atman from the body. As all practices are based on the belief in reincarnation, cremation is the norm within Hinduism and will take place within 24 hours of death.

Prayers and mantras to the person that has died are recited and rice balls are often placed close to the body to help send the person on their next journey to reincarnation or moksha.

The body is carried to the cremation ground which if possible is near flowing water. At the cremation ground the body is circulated by the family as prayers are recited as a sign of respect to the deceased.

The eldest son has an important role to play as part of the funeral with the lighting of the funeral pyre and ensuring that the skull splits as part of the cremation. This is the last step in ensuring that the atman is released from the body and can move on to its next life.

The ashes are placed in a river, ideally the Ganges, to help with the rebirth process.

The Pinda Daan ritual is performed which honours and offers solace to the departed soul. It is believed that it can release the soul from the cycle of rebirth and attain moksha.

There are several mourning practices that learners should understand:

• The Tarpana which is the offering of water to the deities and ancestors to honour and satisfy them.

This lasts for 16 days in the month of Ashwin when rituals are performed to sustain and support the spirits of the deceased on their journey to the higher realms and reincarnation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Learners need to understand what bhakti is. Loving devotion through sacrificial offerings to Brahman. It usually takes the form of food that is given to the gods and returned to the people as Prashad.

How bhakti is performed in different places such as, the home, the mandir and on pilgrimage The completion of puja and arti are daily practices within bhakti as are acts of charity.

Vaishnava bhakti is focused on the devotion of Vishnu and his avatars, and the Vaishnava tradition. Prayers and offerings will be made to Vishnu and there is much a focus on congregational worship within the Mandir.

Shaiva bhakti is focused on the devotion of Shiva and Rudra; and the Saivite tradition. Prayers and offerings will be made to Vishnu. Much of the worship is carried out at home or on pilgrimage.

Suggested learning activities:

- Learners could create a guide to pilgrimage to Ayodhya or Varanasi.
- Learners could draw items needed to complete puja and arti ceremonies as part of Bhakti.
- Learners could create a flow chart showing the differences and similarities between Vishnava and Shaiva Bhakti.

# 1.7.2b Hinduism and morality

Learners should understand:

Hindu beliefs and teachings about morality:

- dharma moral duty guiding everyday actions; Bhagavata Purana 1.2.6
- kama worldly pleasure physical, mental and emotional pleasure
- artha wealth and power, enough of each to feel secure
- Hindus believe in free-will and its link to karma
- due to ignorance Hindus fall into maya a love of money, possessions and even family keep us bound to this world
- Hinduism encourages the cultivation of divine qualities (Daivi Sampad) and warns against the dangers of demonic qualities (Asuri Sampad); Bhagavad Gita chapter 16.

The connection between karma, rebirth and morality in Hinduism.

Learners need to understand that Hindus will make use of a range of sources of authority to support their understanding and beliefs on morality. They should be able to give specific detail on what these sources of authority say and be able to give examples of the sort of decisions they make using these sources of authority.

Dharma is central to all Hindu moral decision making as it guides them in their daily lives. It is by following their Dharma that Hindus attain loving devotion to Brahman. This must be carried out without desire for gain and selflessly giving of themselves. In doing so they satisfy the needs of the self and satisfy Brahman.

Two of the aims of life for a Hindu are kama and artha both of which support Hindus in their moral decision making as they must consider pleasure, wealth and power. The focus here is on how they achieve this. Morally this should be through legal ways and not illegal ways. They would also need to consider the effects of their decisions on others and their commitment to Ahimsa.

Learners need to understand that Hindus do believe in free-will but have to remember how it links to karma. Freewill does not give Hindus the freedom to do as they want but instead to make free choices in the knowledge of the effect that their choices will have on their karma.

Learners need to be aware that Hindus can fall into maya when duty turns into an obsession for possessions or money even family. As such, this can keep the self-tied to the earth in the cycle of rebirth.

The aim of Hindus is to develop and promote qualities of the divine and not demonic qualities. To be pure of heart, generous, speak the truth and non-violent are qualities of the divine whereas deceitfulness, insolence, anger and ignorance are seen as demonic qualities.

{91}------------------------------------------------

Learners need to understand that all moral decision making in Hinduism is connected to the Hindu belief in karma and the effects of this on their rebirth (reincarnation) and ultimately the goal to achieve moksha.

## Suggested learning activities:

- Learners can create a summary page of all the sources of morality that Hindus may use to help them make moral choices.
- Create some moral dilemmas or choices a Hindu may be faced with in their daily life and show how they might use sources of authority to decide what action they may take – this could be written as an Agony Aunt style letter with a response given that follows Hindu principles.

|                      | 1.5.1c Key beliefs and teachings in Islam | Learners should understand:<br>• Beliefs and teachings about the nature of Allah:<br>• one God – Allah: tawhid; Qur'an 3:18<br>• the qualities of Allah in the Qur'an<br>• the 99 names of Allah<br>• immanent<br>• transcendent<br>• beneficent<br>• merciful<br>• omnipotent<br>• omniscient<br>• omnibenevolent<br>• omnipresent | As a starting point, it would be useful for learners to be aware that there are two main branches in Islam – Sunni (who make up around 87%-90% of all worldwide Muslims) and Shi'a (who make up the remaining 10-13% of all Muslims worldwide). The main differences between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims should be identified as being connected to leadership issues after the death of Muhammad, recognition of different versions of Hadith as a source of authority and some key practices where they may perform certain actions differently (e.g. Shi'a Muslims add the name of Ali to the Shahadah). To assess the prior learning of learners, it would be useful to get them to share any knowledge and understanding they have initially as well as explore the context of Islam globally, nationally and locally in Wales, perhaps considering statistical evidence. It would also be useful to consider at the start, throughout and at the end of the study of Unit 1 what Muslims may face in terms of challenges in different parts of the world. It may also be appropriate to address any misconceptions that exist around the religion of Islam due to how it may be presented to many through, for example, the media.<br><br>Learners will need to know that Islam is a monotheistic religion which is summarised by their acceptance of the belief of Tawhid. All Muslims accept belief in one God who they call Allah; a central belief contained in the Shahadah – the Declaration of Faith – and shown in how Muslims submit to Allah in all aspects of their lives. There are many beliefs and teachings about the nature of Allah in the Qur'an including:<br>• Allah is the creator of the universe<br>• Allah is immanent – close and works within the world<br>• Allah is transcendent – beyond human understanding/experience |

{93}------------------------------------------------

Reasons for the prohibition of images of Allah; Qur'an 42:11 and the significance of shirk.

# Prophethood in Islam:

- the role and importance of prophethood within Islam Adam, Ibrahim and Isa
- Muhammad as the Seal of the Prophets the revelation of the Qur'an by Allah, through Angel Jibril Qur'an 2:97-98.

- Allah is beneficent generous and good
- Allah is merciful forgiving
- Allah is omnipotent all-powerful
- Allah is omniscient all seeing/knowing
- Allah is omnibenevolent all loving
- Allah is omnipresent present everywhere

Learners should be able to describe the nature of Allah and give examples of the characteristics of his nature. The opening surah of the Qur'an (Surah Al-Fatihah) contains many ideas about the nature of Allah including that he is the only one worthy of worship.

Allah is seen as transcendent and the Qur'an teaches he has 99 names, each of which relates to one of his characteristics; these help Muslims to feel that they understand what he is like. Some examples of these names include Al-Hakam (The Judge) and Al-Rahim (The Most Merciful). Muslims will often use subhah beads in prayer to remember the 99 names of Allah.

Muslims believe that Allah cannot be captured in an image drawn by the human hand; a belief reinforced in the Qur'an through surah 42:11 when it says *"[He is] Creator of the heavens and the earth…There is nothing like unto Him..*." For this reason, Muslims will not draw Allah and believe to try and do so is disrespectful. Muslims instead use tessellating patterns and Islamic calligraphy rather than images to capture beliefs about Allah. Islam teaches Muslims it is a wrong to believe in more than one God or see anything/anyone as equal to Allah; a sin known as shirk. Islam teaches shirk is the worst sin that can be committed and will not be forgiven by Allah.

Learners will need to know about the role and importance of prophethood in Islam and how it is the method used by Allah to communicate with humanity; a belief known as risalah. The Qur'an names 25 prophets although many Muslims believe there have been

{94}------------------------------------------------

Islamic beliefs about the soul:

- originates from Allah and is His divine creation; Qur'an 32:7-9
- created by Allah and breathed into the human being at conception; the first man, Adam, was given a soul in this way; Qur'an 32:8-9.

over 124,000 in total. The prophets are believed to have been specifically chosen to reveal messages with some revealing these through holy books. Angels (Malaikah) are also an important part of the process of passing messages on between Allah and prophets.

All prophets are seen to be important and are believed to have shared the same message from God; acceptance of belief in one God and that Islam is the true religion. Learners will need to know specific beliefs about the roles of named prophets including:

- Adam the first human and prophet who built the kab'ah and given the specific role of khalifah.
- Ibrahim the father of the Arab people who first refused to worship idols, rebuilt the Kab'ah after it was destroyed and had his faith tested through his willingness to sacrifice his son for God.
- Isa referred to as the '*son of Mary*' who was an important figure; Muslims do not, however, hold the same beliefs as Christians that he was crucified or resurrected or that he was the Son of God.

Learners will also need to know the importance of Muhammad as the final prophet in Islam; he is given the title '*Seal of the prophets'* to recognise being Allah's final messenger and the one chosen to reveal the Qur'an which is accepted as Allah's final message. According to Islam, no further prophets will come after Muhammad.

Learners will need to be aware of what Muslims believe about the soul. Islam teaches that the first human was Adam and Allah breathed life into him. The soul is mentioned twenty-one times in the Qur'an and is understood to be a single entity that came from God when he breathed life into humans. Islam teaches that when a child is born, its soul is imprinted with a belief in God, known as fitrah and this describes human nature. The soul is what Muslims believe is internal to a person and the part that goes to the afterlife after death.

{95}------------------------------------------------

Key beliefs and teachings of Islam:

- submission to Allah being Muslim, and the Shahadah as an expression of faith
- the importance of the Five Pillars of Faith
- the importance of greater jihad.

Learners will need to know specific key practices in Islam which includes how Muslims perform the Five Pillars of Faith and why they are important. These are:

- Shahadah Declaration of faith which is the words "*There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger*." The words are spoken multiple times a day, when a baby is born and the words spoken by Muslims before death.
- Salah compulsory prayer completed five times a day.
- Zakat charity given annually to encourage compassion for others.
- Sawm fasting completing annually during the month of Ramadan to teach self-discipline.
- Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca which is completed once in the lifetime of a Muslim if physically able to do so.

The Five Pillars of Faith in Islam are duties that every Muslim is expected to perform if able and show how Muslims submit to Allah in every aspect of their lives. Greater jihad is the personal internal struggle to be a good Muslim and practicing the Five Pillars is one way that Muslims can achieve this. Other actions may include working for social justice, avoiding negative actions such as drinking alcohol and forgiving others in their daily lives. It would be useful for learners to consider how the Five Pillars of Faith are practised differently by Muslims in different parts of the world and how some may offer more challenge than others. They should also understand the importance of the Pillars in uniting all Muslims under the ummah.

## Suggested learning activities:

- Learners could explore quotes from the Qur'an that detail the nature of Allah and create a summary page showing beliefs Muslims hold about what Allah is like
- Learners could create a resource to identify a glossary of key terms that are useful for the content in this part of the specification – this could be done as a quiz, matching activity or simply key word cards

{96}------------------------------------------------

The use and importance of sacred texts in daily life:

• Qur'an and the Hadith.

- Learners could draw a summary of prophethood to show how messages are passed from Allah to humanity, using examples of specific prophets from their learning to illustrate the connection between Allah and humanity
- Learners could create a summary of the five pillars and make up a poem/song/rap to remember what each one is and information about why they are important
- Learners could create a summary infographic of the main beliefs and teachings in Islam held by Muslims using lines to show the links between them.

Sacred texts are important in Islam in helping Muslims understand how Allah wants them to live their lives. The most important sacred text is the Qur'an which was revealed to Muhammad when he was in a cave on Mount Hira by Angel Jibril; an event remembered today by Muslims as the Night of Power. Muslims accept that Muhammad was chosen by Allah to receive the Qur'an because of his nature as being an honest and trustworthy person and that its full revelation took 23 years. The word 'Qur'an literally means 'revelation' and was spoken by Muhammad as he could not read or write before being written down by his friends and followers after Muhammad's death.

Muslims also look to other sources of authority including the Hadith. It contains the sayings of the people closest to Muhammad and is accepted as the words and actions of Muhammad which were recorded by his followers. It is not believed to be the words of Allah but helps and guide Muslims on what Muhammad did and how they should live their lives. Sunni and Shi'a Muslims accept different versions of Hadith, recognising different levels of accuracy in them.

Muslims will read the Qur'an and look to the Hadith in their daily lives. This may involve reading parts of the Qur'an daily in Arabic, looking at particular verses when they need guidance or using these sources of authority to make decisions in their lives. They may also

Within the Ummah, Muslims are<br>equal, and it promotes the welfare of all Muslims; this is a belief that<br>underpins many practices in Islam as well as offering explanation of<br>why Muslims feel it is important to put their beliefs into action.<br>Whilst Sunni and Shi'a Muslims will accept different versions of the<br>Hadith, there are many teachings within both that teach and reinforce<br>the importance of helping others. Muslims want to follow the example<br>of Muhammad in their daily lives so the collections of what<br>Muhammad did and said will allow them to understand how he<br>behaved towards others. Learners should be able to give examples<br>of these teachings to show they understand how Muslims will use<br>them; they may use examples such as Muhammad sharing food with<br>others, Muhammad teaching others the importance of charity or<br>specific stories such as Muhammad helping a woman when she was<br>ill, despite her treating him badly in the past.<br>All Muslims believe that mercy and forgiveness are important and<br>many teachings from the Qur'an and Hadith support this. One of the<br>99 names of Allah is Al-Ghafoor<br>which means 'the one who has the<br>power to forgive' and Islam teaches that just as Allah forgives<br>humans when they sin, humans should always try to forgive others<br>around them. |

Contemporary local or national examples of Islamic faith and belief in action – community work and faith-based activism.

In performing the Five Pillars of Faith, Muslims show ideas of unity and through this, also equality; this can be seen through Muslims performing the same actions in prayer (Salah) – facing the same directions, performing the same actions, repeating the same preparations – and whilst completing pilgrimage (Hajj) – wearing ihram, performing the same actions, sacrificing an animal, etc. – or the way in which Muslims perform Zakat to help the needy or Sawm to empathise with those who struggle.

Islam teaches that Muslims have a duty to care for others and should put their faith in action through performing acts of kindness towards others. Muslims are encouraged to perform sadaqah which is where they give extra money or more importantly time to help others; this could include volunteering or supporting those in their local community. Learners should be able to research examples of Ummah in action in their local community and contrast this to examples of Muslim organisations such as Islamic Relief who work to put these principles in action through projects they run across the world.

Learners may like to explore local Welsh and national examples of Islamic faith in action which may include local mosques running food banks or providing meals to those in their local community. Further examples could include organising clothes banks, cleaning up local areas in terms of the environment, sharing food from their Eid celebrations or arranging community actions and events to bring people together such as 'Open Mosque' days. Learners could also look at examples of people in their local Welsh community or nationally who have worked for justice and fairness in society. These examples can often be found through research of local Mosque websites – for examples, as seen here:<https://www.almanar.org.uk/>

There are many charity organisations in Islam who work to help those on a local, national and global level. Learners can be aware of examples of these to illustrate how Muslims work to put their faith in action.

{99}------------------------------------------------

How the aims and work of Islamic Relief UK reflect Islamic beliefs in action.

Islamic Relief UK [\(https://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/\)](https://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/) is an example of a charity who puts Islamic beliefs in action. They work locally, nationally and globally in over 40 countries to transform the lives of people. They provide emergency responses to disasters whilst also working with improving conditions in local areas and promoting social development. They aim to "empower people across the UK to act together to save and transform lives."

## Suggested learning activities:

- Learners could create a diagram showing key teachings of Islam and linking them to examples of how Muslims show these teachings through faith in action
- Learners could research any local, national or global examples of Muslims who have worked to put their faith in action, creating a fact file of who they are, what they did and why they did it reflecting Islamic teachings
- Learners could research the aims and work of Islamic Relief UK to create a fact file showing how they put faith into action, producing a leaflet to inform people of their work.

This is apparent in Qur'an 33:35.<br>Muslims believe this<br>can be achieved through their beliefs and actions and will try to live<br>their life following the teachings of Islam to please Allah. Sources of<br>authority such as the Qur'an, the Hadith and the example set by<br>Muhammad and other prophets are ways that Muslims learn how<br>they should behave and act. Learners should understand how the<br>meaning of life being shown as submitting to the will of Allah is seen<br>through their practices – for example, in examples such as<br>performing the five pillars of faith, caring for others and creating a<br>sense of unity and through charitable actions where faith is put into<br>action. Performing acts of righteousness for Allah is shown in Qur'an<br>18:30. Acts of worship such as attending the mosque for the<br>Jummah service, worshipping only Allah and being righteous through<br>how they behave towards others reflects the Islamic way of life. This<br>is reflected in Qur'an 40:65.<br>There are many acts that Muslims can perform to please Allah which<br>may include performing the Five Pillars of Faith, acts of social justice,<br>having a family, following halal diet rules and standing up against<br>injustice, amongst many others. Muslims believe that in living their<br>lives this way they are both following the teachings of Islam and the<br>example that was set by Muhammad.<br>Islam teaches Muslims that this life is a test for the afterlife and that<br>their beliefs and actions will contribute to whether they receive<br>reward or punishment on the Day of Judgement (Qur'an 84:25 and<br>3:185).<br>Muslims also, however, believe that Allah will not test them<br>more than they can manage which is compatible with the nature of<br>Allah being fair and merciful.

The Qur'an contains many teachings about the afterlife, including beliefs about the soul, resurrection and it provides descriptive summaries of what the afterlife is like (Qur'an 46:33).<br><br>Many of the key beliefs about teachings about the afterlife relate to other beliefs in Islam and learners should be able to not only explain what happens after death but also understand why these beliefs are important. Muslims believe that after death, the soul is taken by Azra'il, the Angel of Death where it enters a stage of <b>Barzakh</b> – a state of waiting until the Day of Judgement. God send two angels – <b>Munkar</b> and <b>Nakir</b> – to question the waiting soul and test their faith asking three questions; Who is your prophet?

announce the Day of Judgement, and this is when all will be raised from their graves and brought before Allah to be judged on how they lived their earthly lives – a belief known as bodily resurrection. A book that represents everything an individual has done will be presented to each person – if their good deeds outweigh their bad, it will be given to them in their right hand and pass to Jannah (Paradise). If their bad deeds outweigh their good deeds, the book will be given to them in their left hand, and they pass to Jahannam (Hellfire).

Learners should understand the descriptions of Paradise (Jannah) and Hellfire (Jahannam) given in the Qur'an.

Jannah is described as paradise; a garden of bliss with rivers flowing of wine, milk or honey that does not intoxicate. There are believed to be seven levels (although some Muslims believe there may be up to one hundred) with the most devoted going to the highest level and they are monitored by nineteen angels. In contrast, Jahannam is described as a place of fire and pain. It is also believed that there are seven levels showing there are different levels of punishment; each will be pitch black with scorching winds where screams from those in each can be heard.

A key Muslim belief is acceptance of Al -Qadr (predestination) which is understood as the concept of Allah knowing everything already. Although Muslims believe that humans were made by Allah and given freewill, they also believe that Allah knows what decisions they will make; a belief that aligns with understanding of Allah being all knowing.

- care through respect for the body.
- The deceased will be dressed in Kafan which is a simple plain cloth or if they have completed Hajj, they may be dressed in the white ihram clothes – this shows modesty and unity/equality within death.
- The funeral of a Muslim who has died usually takes place within 24 hours of death and the body will be buried facing towards Mecca – this is done to reflect the temporary nature of life on earth and for practical reasons in hot countries as the body will start to decay. Facing Mecca is done because it is the holy city for Islam.
- Burial rather than cremation is preferred – this is because Muslims believe in the idea of bodily resurrection after death.
- It is usually men who will attend the funeral, and they wear dark colours – women may be considered too emotional although it is not unusual for men and women to attend if they wish.
- Salat al -Janazah is performed by the family, friends and Muslim community of the deceased – this is the special funeral prayer that is performed to seek forgiveness for the person who has died and give thanks to Allah for their life.
- Mourners are expected to dress appropriately during this time, often wearing black to symbolise mourning and refrain from wearing decorative clothing or jewellery. They are expected to spend an appropriate amount of time receiving visitors and those who wish to show their respect and share their condolences – these actions are done to show it is a time of sadness and the need for respect to the deceased.
- At the graveside of the deceased, a family member, usually an elder, will be selected to perform dua – this extra prayer reminds Muslims of the connection to Allah and the wish for the deceased to continue in the afterlife to Jannah.
- The mourning period in Islam typically lasts three days but widows of the deceased have an extended period of mourning known as 'iddah' which lasts four months and ten days – this is

| 1.7.1c<br>Islam<br>identity,<br>belonging and<br>practices | Learners should understand:<br>The importance of expressing a sense of identity and<br>belonging for Muslims, such as:<br>• belonging to a worshipping community<br>• a shared sense of purpose and direction in life.<br>Islamic identity and belonging expressed through<br>symbolic actions  – pilgrimage.<br>Possible reasons for completing pilgrimage:<br>• showing commitment to Allah as an act of religious<br>devotion<br>• learning more about Islamic figures by visiting sites<br>associated with their lives<br>• following in the footsteps of key figures in Islam<br>• experiencing a sense of community. | Identity is a key feature of Islam and can take many forms. Learners<br>need to be able to give examples of how Muslims show their religion<br>to others through their actions and behaviour; this could include<br>examples such as through dress customs, following diet rules,<br>attending Jummah (Friday prayers) at the mosque and following the<br>five pillars of Islamic faith, alongside other actions performed by<br>Muslims. Muslim identity and unity are reflected through the ummah<br>– the Muslim worldwide community  – and acceptance that all<br>Muslims are part of this is seen to strengthen their sense of identity.<br>Completion of the fifth Pillar of Faith  – Hajj  – shows identity and<br>belonging for Muslims. All Muslims are expected to take part at least<br>once in their lifetime if they are physically fit enough and<br>economically stable enough to achieve it.<br>There are many reasons why Muslims may choose to complete<br>pilgrimage; the most important being that it is a duty that is expected<br>of all Muslims. It shows submission towards Allah and as it is a<br>difficult journey with many challenges to overcome for successful<br>completion, it is accepted to be an act of religious devotion for<br>Muslims who complete it. Through attending Hajj and completing the<br>practices/rituals required, Muslims will learn more about places of<br>significance within Islam; for example, Mecca is where Prophet<br>Muhammad lived and grew up and is a key focal point of many acts<br>of submission for Muslims today whilst Medinah is where the religion<br>of Islam was first established by Muhammad. Some places also hold<br>importance to other key figures in Islam; for example, the Kabah in<br>Mecca was first built by Prophet Adam and rebuilt by Prophet<br>Ibrahim. Through completing the practices of Hajj, Muslims can 'see'<br>the history and development of Islam and build a sense of unity and<br>community with other Muslims who also undertake this important<br>pillar of faith. |

The role, significance and features of the following sites of Islamic pilgrimage during Hajj:

- Mount Arafat
- the pillars at Mina.

Islamic identity and belonging expressed through symbolic actions – observing dress and diet customs:

- the burkha
- the hijab
- the niqab
- halal food.

Various actions performed on pilgrimage show identity including Muslims all wearing ihram, performing the same actions such as praying on Mount Arafat, completing Tawaf by circling the Kab'ah or rejecting the devil through throwing stones at the pillars in Mina as well as taking part at the end of Hajj through celebration of Eid-ul-Fitr (a festival which all Muslims all over the world take part in at the same time). Muslims believe that they are following in the footsteps of Muhammad by completing the actions on pilgrimage and showing unity and equality with all Muslims.

Dress in Islam can show Muslim identity. Learners should be aware of key Islamic teachings on dress such as the belief that Muslims should always dress modestly and the diversity that exists in Muslims' interpretation of this. Different forms of dress can be chosen by Muslims such as:

- the burkha that covers the whole face and body head to toe
- the hijab which is a headscarf that covers the head leaving the face open
- the niqab that is a veil that covers the face leaving the eyes visible.

There will be different choices for each item and different arguments surrounding the choice with each interpreting Muslim identity in different ways.

Learners should be aware of both diversity in dress and the controversial nature that exists around arguments about dress.

Muslims follow a halal diet, and learners should understand what this is and the specific rules this means they must follow. 'Halal' means 'allowed' and when applied to food, it is the food they are allowed to eat or meat that has been killed and prepared in a certain way according to Islamic law. Muslims will not eat any product from a pig, eat animals not slaughtered properly nor drink alcohol. Meat has to

| be killed according to strict halal rules including the animal being<br>blessed before being killed, not killed in front of other animals, killed<br>by the jugular vein being cut and the meat being hung upside down<br>so the blood drains out. These methods and halal food rules show<br>Muslim identity.<br>Suggested learning activities:<br>•<br>Learners could build a model showing the main actions<br>performed by Muslims on Hajj, take a photo and label the actions<br>and reasons behind them linking them to how they show Muslim<br>identity<br>•<br>Learners could draw items of dress that Muslims may choose to<br>wear, labelling them to show reasons for choice of dress<br>•<br>Learners can create a halal menu showing understanding of<br>Islamic diet laws. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Morality and Divine judgement in the afterlife:

• The judging of souls on the Day of Judgement; Qur'an 6:160-164; Qur'an 16:90; Qur'an 16:97; Qur'an 21:47.

law and is based on the Qur'an. It details guidance that can apply to all aspects of the life of a Muslim including family and financial matters as well as issues of personal hygiene or clothing.

Finally, Muslims believe that when Allah created humans, he gave them a conscience which is an in-built system of knowing whether a decision is right or wrong and Muslims believe they should trust and use this to help them make moral choices.

A key Islamic belief is acceptance of life on earth being a test for the afterlife and Muslims believe Allah will judge them on the decisions they made on earth on the Day of Judgement. Islam teaches that Muslims were given freewill but this comes with responsibility and accountability that they need to try and live according to Allah's will so they will receive reward in the afterlife rather than punishment.

Suggested learning activities:

- Learners can create a summary page of all the sources of morality that Muslims may use to help them make moral choices – they could try to rank them in order of importance to a Muslim facing a moral decision
- Learners could create moral dilemmas or choices a Muslim may be faced with in their daily life and show how they might use sources of authority to decide what action they may take – this could be written as an Agony Aunt style letter with a response given that follows Islamic principles.

There are many<br>characteristics about God, including God as creator, transcendent<br>(above and beyond worldly things), merciful (compassionate), eternal<br>(no beginning or end, has always existed and will always exist),<br>judge (judges everyone), law-giver (God gave rules for Jews to<br>obey), omnipotence (all-powerful), omniscience (all-knowing),<br>omnibenevolence (all-loving) and omnipresent (present, everywhere,<br>at all times).<br>Jews believe that one day God will send the Messiah<br>(which means<br>'Anointed One'), known as the Mashiach. The Messiah is known as<br>Mashiach in Hebrew. Mashiach refers to the ancient practice of<br>anointing kings with oil when they took the throne. The arrival of the<br>Messiah is known as the Messianic Age, or 'Olam Ha-Ba' ('the world<br>to come') and will be a time where the Messiah will judge and create<br>a fair government in Israel. However, there are different views about<br>the Messiah and the Messianic Age. Orthodox<br>Jews believe the<br>Messiah is a person who will be a descendant of King David and will<br>rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. They believe that the Messianic<br>Age will triumph over the enemies of Israel and lead to people living<br>in peace. It will also mark the end<br>of the world and the resurrection of<br>the dead.<br>Reform Jews believe they should pray for a Messianic Age which will<br>bring about peace. They believe that the Messiah will not necessarily<br>be a person, and the Messianic Age will bring peace and an<br>understanding of God, rather than the rebuilding of the Temple. |

Jewish beliefs and teachings about the soul:

- the soul (nefesh) created in the image of God; Genesis 1:27
- a divine spark originating from God; Genesis 2:7
- eternal and transcendent, humans possess rationality and free will.

Key beliefs and teachings in Judaism:

- the Shema prayer; Deuteronomy 6:4-5
- covenants:
  - the Abrahamic Covenant; identity, monotheism, circumcision and Promised Land, Genesis12:1-3, 17:6-8, 17:11-14
  - the Mosaic Covenant; law, commandments, identity, Promised Land, Exodus 3:11- 15
  - the importance of the Covenants for Jews today.

Jews believe humans are created in the image of God and have a soul (nefesh). Genesis describes how God breathed into man's nostrils, the breath of life. This divine spark of the human soul makes humans different from all other creations. The soul allows a person to possess rationality and free will, so a person is able to make choices for themselves. Jews also believe the soul is transcendent and eternal, meaning it will live on after the body has died.

The Shema [\(https://www.jewfaq.org/prayers\\_shema\)](https://www.jewfaq.org/prayers_shema) is a prayer that declares the Jewish belief in one God. The Shema is found in the Torah and reminds Jews that they should worship God with their heart, soul and strength. Many Jews will recite the Shema twice a day – 'When you lie down and when you get up' [Deuteronomy 6:7]. The Shema can be found in the mezuzah and inside tefillin. The first line is repeated daily [Deuteronomy 6:4-5].

A covenant is a promise or agreement between two parties. Covenants were made between God and Noah, Abraham and Moses and reinforces the idea of Jews being God's chosen people.

- Abrahamic Covenant Abraham was the first person to believe in one God (monotheism). The covenant included the Promised Land (land promised to Abraham's descendants), a promise of descendants (God changed Abram's name to Abraham which means 'father of many nations'), and the promise of blessing and redemption (God blessed Abraham and required him to circumcise himself and all Jewish males after him).
- Mosaic Covenant Moses was the only person to witness God, face to face. As part of the covenant, God asked Moses to free the Israelites from Egyptian slavery, leading them through the wilderness towards the Promised Land. Whilst Moses was in the wilderness, God revealed to him the 613 commandments, including the Ten Commandments, that Jews are expected to follow.

{112}------------------------------------------------

The use and importance of sacred texts in daily life:

• the differing perspectives of Orthodox and Reform Judaism on the Torah, the Tenakh and the Talmud. • Covenant today – the covenant remains essential for Jews and continues to show their relationship with God. For example, many Jewish boys will still take part in the Brit Milah ceremony at eight days old. This circumcision ceremony reminds Jews of the covenant God made with Abraham and is the first sign of Jewish male identity. The commandments God gave Moses are also still followed by Jews; such as 'Keep the Sabbath day holy'. Jews also celebrate Passover (Pesach) each year in Wales, the U.K., Israel and the rest of the world. During Passover, Jews remember how God helped the Israelites escape slavery in Egypt.

Sacred texts provide Jews with information about every aspect of their life, such as creation, food laws, festival observances, the covenant. The Tenakh is the Hebrew Bible and is made up of three parts – Torah, Nevi'im and Ketuvim. The Torah contains the 613 commandments that Jews must follow. It is read over a year in Orthodox synagogues and over three years in Reform synagogues. Orthodox Jews believe the Torah is the revelation from God given to Moses on Mount Sinai in its final form. They believe it is relevant to life today, so try to keep the commandments in the Torah in every detail and not change them. Reform Jews believe the Torah is based on the revelation from God. However, they think it was written by humans over a period of time, based on their experiences with God and other humans. It can be adapted to changing circumstances.

The Nevi'im, meaning 'Prophets' contain eight books of the Prophets and encourage Jews to follow the laws in the Torah. The Ketuvim, meaning 'writings', are based on history and poetry.

Some Jews find the Tenakh difficult to understand. Jews therefore have the Talmud, the oral law, which helps them understand the laws in the Tenakh. For example, the Talmud is split into 6 sections which contain information about issues such as land, prayer, festivals, relationships – [https://www.jewfaq.org/torah#Talmud.](https://www.jewfaq.org/torah#Talmud)

| 1.5.2d<br>Jewish belief in action | Learners should understand:<br><br>Jewish beliefs and teachings:<br>Gemilut Hasadim; acts of loving kindness - doing good deeds to reflect God's compassion; Pirkei Avot 1:2 from the MishnahJews are instructed by God to help the poor and needy; Deuteronomy 15:11Tikkun Olam; repair of the world includes the idea of social justice. | Learners will need to know that Gemilut Hasadim means ‘acts of loving kindness’ and involves doing good deeds to reflect God’s compassion.<br><br>It is a mitzvah (duty) for Jews to help the poor and needy and therefore, Jews can obey God by performing Gemilut Hasadim. This can be achieved by being charitable and generous, such as feeding the hungry or visiting the sick. Jews believe that the highest level of Gemilut Hasadim is to attend a funeral service as the dead are unable to repay the kindness.<br><br>Tikkun Olam refers to repairing the world. The purpose of this is for Jews to look after the world the best way they can. This could involve living a sustainable life, including recycling, reducing their carbon footprint, picking up litter. Many synagogues hold charity events to help support those in need. |

Contemporary local or national examples of Judaism faith and belief in action - community work and faith-based activism.

There are many examples, both locally and nationally of how Jews put their faith and belief in action. For example, Jews put their beliefs into action through observing kashrut and festivals (such as Passover and Shabbat) and by attending a synagogue to worship with other Jews. This allows Jews to feel part of a global community and feel a bond with Jewish people around the world.

Helping other people is an important mitzvot (duty) in Judaism. Tzedakah is the Hebrew word for charity and justice. Through Tzedakah, Jews are able to put their faith into action. This can be achieved by giving money to those in need, showing kindness and respect to others, helping the sick, the elderly and through volunteering.

The JNF UK is a Jewish charity that aims to relieve poverty, relieve those in need and work towards environmental protection and improvement - [https://www.jnf.co.uk/.](https://www.jnf.co.uk/)

The charity, Jewish Care provides care for older people [https://jewishcare.org/.](https://jewishcare.org/)

How the aims and work of Mitzvah Day reflect Jewish beliefs in action.

World Jewish Relief is an example of a charity in the UK that provides humanitarian response to those in need [https://www.worldjewishrelief.org/.](https://www.worldjewishrelief.org/)

Mitzvah Day is the UK's largest day of social action and brings people together to make a difference to their communities. They bring people together to address social action through food bank collections, planting new trees and donations to homeless charities.

Suggested learning activities:

- Create an advert, to encourage Jews to donate towards Gemilut Hasadim.
- Research the aims and work of Mitzvah Day. Present information through a series of social media posts.

| 1.6.1d<br>Meaning of life in<br>Judaism             | Learners should understand:<br>Jewish beliefs about the meaning of life:<br>•<br>living in accordance with the covenant with God<br>•<br>observing the mitzvot of the Torah<br>•<br>pursuing justice, compassion, and lifelong learning<br>•<br>fostering strong family and community ties. | Learners will need to know that Jews will live in accordance with the<br>covenant. Jews obey the covenant in many ways such as celebrating<br>Pesach (Passover), ensuring Jewish baby boys are circumcised at<br>eight days old, and observing the mitzvot in the Torah, such as food<br>laws and festivals. For example, Jews will only eat kosher food in<br>accordance with the teachings of the Torah, such as not mixing milk<br>and meat,<br>and only eating animals with cloven hooves and chew the<br>cud. Jews will also observe festivals such as Passover, Rosh<br>Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Passover reminds Jews of how God<br>asked Moses to free the Israelites from Egyptian slavery. Rosh<br>Hashanah, which means 'head of the year', celebrates the Jewish<br>New Year and remembers the creation of the world and a fresh start.<br>Yom Kippur is also known as the 'Day of Atonement'. It is the holiest<br>day of the year where Jews will reflect on their past year and ask for<br>God's forgiveness.<br>Learners will need to know that Jews believe pursuing justice is the<br>foundation of a fair and moral society. This can be achieved by<br>behaving how God expects Jews to live, such as showing acts of<br>compassion and Tzedakah. Jews will continue to show acts of<br>kindness (Gemilut Hasadim) towards others through being charitable<br>and generous. Jews will study Jewish sacred texts, such as the<br>Torah and Talmud as part of their lifelong learning.<br>Learners will need to know how families are important in Judaism. It<br>is a duty for a married couple to procreate and develop a strong<br>family unit. Couples should teach their children Jewish traditions and<br>teachings. For example, one important role of the woman is to teach<br>her children to run a Jewish home, such as obeying kashrut and<br>observing festivals such as Pesach. One important role of the man is<br>to teach his children about Judaism and ensure they attend<br>synagogue worship. |

| 1.6.2d<br>Jewish beliefs<br>about life and<br>death | Jewish beliefs about the afterlife:<br>• Gan Eden (paradise)<br>• Gehenna (hell)<br>• Resurrection; bodily (Orthodox) and spiritual (Reform)<br>• Olam Ha-Ba (the world to come - the afterlife also often linked to the Messianic Age)<br>• Sheol (where souls are cleansed and purified). | Learners will need to know that Jews focus on this life, rather than the afterlife. A person's actions in life are important and there are differences in opinions about the afterlife. Orthodox and Reform Jews have different views about the resurrection of the body. Orthodox Jews do not allow cremation because they believe that the physical body will be resurrected. Reform Jews believe that only the soul will be resurrected and therefore the body is not needed.<br><br>In Judaism, heaven is known as Gan Eden. Many Jews consider it to be a place of sunshine where all people will be together in peace. Others believe it is a state of consciousness where souls feel close to God. Many Jews believe in Olam Ha-Ba (meaning ‘the world to come’). This is linked to the Messianic Age where God has judged the living and dead. It is possible that some souls will go to Gehenna (hell) after death. This is a place of torment and punishment. Souls may also be sent to Sheol which is described as a place of darkness; a place where souls are cleansed and purified, after a person has died.<br><br>Suggested learning activities:<br>• Create a resource to identify a glossary of key terms that is useful for this content.

# 1.6.3d Jewish practices

The importance of mourning and funeral practices:

- committing a person's body to God
- giving thanks to God for that person's life
- celebrating and remembering the life of the deceased
- using signs and symbols to express a deeper meaning
- showing the link between this life and Jewish beliefs about the afterlife.

Jewish mourning practices:

- aninut
- shiva
- shloshim
- yarzheit.

Jewish funeral practices:

- taharah
- the funeral service.

Learners will need to know that funerals are important as they commit the person's body to God and provide people with an opportunity to give thanks for that person's life. There are many practices within a funeral that allow mourners to celebrate and remember the life of the deceased. Jewish funerals also give meaning to beliefs about the afterlife.

The time between death and the funeral is known as aninut. The mourner at this point is known as an onan (immediate mourner) and it is their responsibility to arrange the burial, usually within 24 hours. Mourning begins by reciting the Kaddish prayer which allows Jews to focus on God.

The first week after the funeral is known as shiva (seven). During this week the mourners gather in one of their homes and pray. During shiva, Jews will sit on low chairs, they will not cut their hair or nails, all mirrors are covered, sexual relations are forbidden, and they do not listen to music or wear leather shoes. At the end of the week the mourners return to their daily duties.

Shloshim takes place for 30 days after the funeral. Mourners are allowed to leave their home and return to work, but they will not cut their hair or shave during this time. Jews mourning a parent will be avelut (the year of mourning for the loss of a parent) where kaddish will be recited daily. During this time, Jews will avoid parties and will recite kaddish every day.

The anniversary of death is called yahrzeit. A special yahrzeit candle is burnt for 24 hours and kaddish is said. The children leave a small stone on the grave to show they have attended the grave. A stone will not die and is therefore a more permanent reminder. Some Jews will fast on this day or donate to charities.

{118}------------------------------------------------

Taharah will then take place. Taharah means purification and is the ritual of washing and preparing the deceased for burial. The chevra kaddisha (holy or burial society) will perform this role, showing respect to the deceased. Performing taharah is considered to be a mitzvah of high praise and great honour. The body is then placed in a simple, unpolished wooden coffin to show that in death people are equal.

Before an Orthodox Jewish funeral takes place, the immediate mourners will make a tear in their garments. This is known as keriah and symbolises their grief. Flowers are not allowed at a Jewish funeral. This is because, although flowers are beautiful, they die and are therefore only a temporary memorial. The Jewish funeral service is very brief. Psalms are read, followed by a short prayer praising God for granting life and taking it away. The rabbi often says a short talk about the dead person. The coffin is then lowered into the ground and mourners begin to fill the grave with earth. They do this to confirm in their own minds that the person is dead. They are also showing oneness with the close relatives who are mourning the death. The mourner is now known as an avel – prolonged mourner. When the mourners return home, they have a meal of hard-boiled eggs which shows the mourner's inability to put their grief into words and to symbolise eternal life.

## Suggested learning activities:

- Design a flow map of Jewish funeral practices.
- Write an 'agony aunt' style response to a non-Jew, outlining the mourning practices in Judaism.

In the synagogue the Ner Tamid, or<br>everlasting light, will burn continuously to show God's eternal<br>presence. Jews will also feel God's presence through prayer. The<br>synagogue is used as a house of prayer (beit tefillah), where Jews<br>come together to pray.

{120}------------------------------------------------

At the Western Wall Jews can feel close to where the Temple, which was destroyed by the Romans , once stood. Jews have an opportunity to write prayers on paper and place them inside the crevices of the wall as this is where some believe God's presence rests. The aron hakodesh, which holds the Torah scrolls, in the synagogue faces east towards the Western Wall.

In 1953, the Israeli Government (Knesset) established Yad Vashem, Israel's national Holocaust memorial. The name Yad Vashem can be translated as 'a memorial and a name'. Yad Vashem is important as it commemorates, documents, researches and educates about the Holocaust. Within Yad Vashem there are areas of significance for Jews. These include :

- the Historical Museum about the history of the Holocaust, starting in Germany in 1933 to the last stages of the Holocaust
- the Hall of Remembrance with names of 22 concentration camps engraved onto a mosaic floor
- the Hall of Names which records the names of the millions of Jews who were killed in the Holocaust.

Yad Vashem is therefore a significant place for Jews to remember their history and to strengthen their community.

Learners will need to know that Jews can express their identity and belonging through observing dress and diet customs. For example, Jewish men will wear a kippah (skull cap) as a sign of awe and respect to God. Wearing the kippah is a reminder for Jews that God is always above them and they are always in the presence of God. Tefillin are worn mainly by Orthodox Jewish men during morning prayer. Tefillin consists of two leather boxes which contain words from the Shema. The tefillah shel rosh is bound to the head with four compartments containing the first two paragraphs of the Shema , and the tefillah shel yad is bound to the upper arm and contains a single scroll of the same passages from the Shema.

{121}------------------------------------------------

Tefillin are worn mainly by Orthodox Jewish men and remind Jews how they should worship God with their heart and mind. Jewish men are obeying the commandments from the Shema when they wear tefillin - Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.' Deuteronomy 6:8. Orthodox Jewish men and some men and women in Liberal and Reform Judaism will also wear a tallit during morning services, each Shabbat and at Yom Kippur. The tallit is a four cornered white prayer shawl that reminds Jews of the 613 commandments (mitzvot) that they should obey. The four corners of the tallit are fringes, known as tzitzit. Wearing a tallit reminds Jews that God is always around them. Some Jewish men wear a tallit katan under their shirts as a constant reminder that God is with them. Jewish men are usually wrapped in their tallit when they are buried. They are wrapped in their tallit with the tzitzit cut off to represent that they are no longer obliged to fulfil the mitzvot.

Learners will need to know how Jews express their identity through diet customs. Food laws in Judaism are known as kashrut and can be split into three sections: kosher meaning fit or correct; treifa meaning forbidden ; and parev meaning neutral. The Torah contains information about food Jews can and cannot eat and how it should be prepared. For example, the Torah states that Jews should only eat animals with cloven hooves and chew the cud , and fish with fins and scales. There are also important rules about how food should be prepared. For example, the Torah includes instructions about not mixing milk and meat. Jews may only eat animals and birds that have been killed in a certain way in accordance with Jewish law. The method of killing is known as shechita . Shechita is a cut across the throat with a razor -sharp knife. Causing pain to any living creature is strictly forbidden in Jewish law. A skilled professional slaughterer called a shochet performs the slaughtering. The Torah commands Jews not to eat the blood of animals and birds. Jews use salt and water to remove the blood from meat before cooking it. To certify food is kosher a label called a hechsher is printed onto the packet or carton.

{122}------------------------------------------------

Jews believe that by following the mitzvot they will live a good life, will be closer to God and their deeds will be judged in the afterlife

Keeping kosher is considered to show respect to God and Jewish traditions. It is also a reminder of the covenant between God and the Jews. It also brings the community together by uniting them and provides them with an identity. By observing kashrut Jews are obeying God's commandments and are constantly reminded that they are God's chosen people. Suggested learning activities: • Research the internal features of a synagogue. Create a model of a synagogue. • Research a Bar or Bat Mitzvah. Imagine you had attended the ceremony. Create a podcast, to explain what happened and why it is important. • Create a series of digital stories about either Yad Vashem or the Western Wall. Include where they are and why they are important. • Prepare a menu for a kosher restaurant. Within the menu explain the reasons for the food options. 1.7.2d Judaism and morality Learners should understand: Jewish beliefs and teachings about how to make moral decisions: • obeying divine commands - the Ten Commandments that form part of the covenant; Exodus 20:1-17 • the 613 Mitzvot (Orthodox and Reform perspectives) • use of conscience (matzpun) in conjunction with the Torah • good inclinations (yetzer ha tov) versus evil inclinations (yetzer hara) and the free will to make these judgements • ethical teachings of the Torah, the Tenakh, and the Talmud (Orthodox and Reform perspectives). Learners will need to know how Jews make moral decisions based on the 613 mitzvot, including the Ten Commandments [Exodus 20:1- 17]. This can include observing food laws, belief in one God and obeying the Covenant. The 613 mitzvot cover ritual mitzvot which focus on worship and festivals, and moral mitzvot which covers how Jews should deal with other people. Following these laws are an important part of Judaism. The 613 mitzvot are made up of 248 positive mitzvot, known as mitzvot aseh and 365 negative mitzvot, known as mitzvot lo taaseh. Jews will use their free will and conscience (matzpun) to decide whether to obey the mitzvot. They believe humans were born to have both good inclinations (yetzer ha tov) and evil inclinations (yetzer hara) and the ability to use their free will to make these decisions.

{123}------------------------------------------------

Morality and Divine judgement in the afterlife:

- God judging your every deed; Ecclesiastes 12:14
- a time of distress but also divine judgment; Daniel 12:1-2.

(Ecclesiastes 12:14). Orthodox Jews will obey the mitzvot, from sacred texts, strictly as they are the direct word of God. However, Reform Jews believe it is their personal choice whether they observe the mitzvot from sacred texts. They believe the mitzvot were influenced by the culture of the time and may not be fully relevant today. Jews believe humans were born to have both good and bad inclinations.

## Suggested learning activities:

- Create a resource to identify a glossary of key terms that is useful for this content. This could be a quiz, matching key words.
- Think of a moral dilemma. Write an agony aunt style letter outlining how Jews would use their beliefs to respond to the dilemma.

Sikh beliefs and teaching about Waheguru as Creator:

- the world created through divine will (hukam); Guru Granth Sahib 1399
- created the universe and all life within it; sustains everything in existence; Guru Granth Sahib 294
- Waheguru exists beyond and separate from the universe (Nirgun and Sargun).

Sikh beliefs about the atma (human soul):

- the soul as a divine essence; a spark of Waheguru; resides within every living being - animals and humans
- humans are the highest form of living creature; pure; transcendent, eternal
- the atma comes from the Waheguru and returns to it.

Sikhs understand that all things in existence have come about through the command and will of Waheguru, and that before creation there was nothing but Waheguru. There is no detailed creation story as in other religions.

Due to the nature of God being Sargun, everything in existence has the presence of Waheguru. This may impact attitudes towards environmental ethics, social justice and the treatment of animals.

Sikhs believe all living beings to have a 'divine spark'; part of Waheguru within them – developing upon the idea that all of creation has the presence of Waheguru. Sikhs believe humans to be the highest of God's creation due to their ability to become Gurmukh and break the cycle of samsara (birth death and rebirth). Breaking the cycle of samsara and achieving mukti (liberation) will result in the atma returning to Waheguru. The understanding of the soul impacts attitudes towards the treatment of animals, social justice, as well as religious and moral duty. The understanding of the soul impacts Sikh beliefs about karma and reincarnation.

Key beliefs and teachings of:

- Guru Nanak
- Guru Gobind Singh.

The use and importance of sacred texts in daily life:

• the Guru Granth Sahib.

Learners should know;

Guru Nanak's beliefs and teachings could include an emphasis on equality, selfless service and devotion to One God. Key teachings include "Naam Japo, Kirat Karo, Vand Chhako" (Meditate, Earn Honestly, Share).

Guru Gobind Singh's beliefs and teachings could include founding the Khalsa, advocating courage, justice and spiritual discipline through instructing wearing the turban.

Suggested Learning Activities:

- Explore Guru Nanak's teachings through stories like 'Sacha Sauda'.
- Role-play the Khalsa initiation ceremony.
- Discuss equality in modern contexts.

The Guru Granth Sahib (GGS), Sikhism's eternal Guru, offers spiritual guidance, moral principles, and teachings about devotion to God and their core beliefs regarding equality. It is central to worship and personal meditation and read daily for inspiration.

Spiritual Guidance and devotion to God - the GGS emphasises a personal connection with the Divine through devotion and meditation. This verse highlights the importance of meditating on God's name to attain spiritual enlightenment:

*"Sing the praises of the Lord, the treasure of virtue; through the Guru, the Lord is revealed."* (*GGS 2*)

Unity with God - the GGS teaches that realising God is the ultimate goal of life. This verse shows the omnipresence of God and the need for surrender to His will:

*"He Himself is the Master, and He Himself is the servant. O Nanak, He Himself is pervading and permeating all."* (*GGS 25*)

{127}------------------------------------------------

Teachings on Devotion to God – the GGS encourages Naam Simran (Meditation on God's Name) and repetition of God's name (Naam Japna) is presented as the highest spiritual practice as exemplified by the quote below :

*"Meditate on the Lord's Name, and cross over the terrifying world ocean."* (*GGS 67*)

Moral Principles and equality of all beings - The Guru Granth Sahib advocates for equality regardless of caste, creed or gender. This verse stresses the Sikh belief in universal equality :

*"Recognise the Lord's Light within all, and do not consider social class or status; there are no classes or castes in the hereafter."* (*GGS 349*)

Moral principles and honest living – the GGS teaches the importance of earning an honest livelihood and sharing with others. This verse reinforces the principles of truthfulness and selflessness.

*"The person who earns through hard work and then shares with others has found the path to righteousness."* (*GGS 1245*)

The GGS is central to daily worship and meditation as part of the daily recitation (Nitnem) where Sikhs are encouraged to read and recite specific prayers from the Guru Granth Sahib daily, such as Japji Sahib, Rehras Sahib and Kirtan Sohila. For example, they may read the opening lines, the Mool Mantra , which are recited as a foundational prayer:

*"Ik Onkar, Sat Naam, Karta Purakh, Nirbhau, Nirvair, Akaal Moorat, Ajooni, Saibhang, Gurprasad."* (*GGS 1* )

These lines encapsulate Sikh beliefs and serve as a daily reminder of God's attributes.

The Guru Granth Sahib is placed at the centre of every Gurdwara and read aloud during worship, emphasising its role in guiding the community. The practice of Akhand Path, a continuous 48-hour reading of the scripture, demonstrates its importance in collective and personal devotion. Suggested Learning Activities: Visit a gurdwara or show a virtual tour to observe the Guru Granth Sahib in use.Discuss excerpts e.g. the Mool Mantra, exploring its relevance today.Create a class reflection on sacred texts' role in promoting values.

The Guru Granth Sahib (13:11-12) teaches that<br>attachment to worldly desires traps the soul in samsara. Liberation,<br>or mukti, is achieved by overcoming ego, performing good deeds,<br>meditating on Waheguru and aligning with divine will (hukam).<br>Mukti signifies ultimate union with Waheguru, ending the cycle of<br>reincarnation<br>and achieving eternal bliss.

an opportunity for spiritual growth, the goal is to transcend it through righteous living and devotion.

## Suggested Learning Activities:

- Discuss Karma and Samsara: Use examples to explain how actions (karma) influence future lives and discuss how ethical living contributes to liberation.
- Text Analysis: Study Guru Granth Sahib 13:11-12 to explore Sikh views on material attachment and spiritual freedom. Ask learners to reflect on what 'liberation' means in different contexts.
- Role-play Scenarios: Create life situations illustrating positive and negative karma, encouraging learners to consider consequences and moral choices.
- Compare Beliefs: Compare Sikh teachings about reincarnation and liberation with Hinduism and Buddhism to highlight similarities and distinctions.
- Reflection Activity: Have learners create a timeline, or 'pathway to mukti', identifying qualities and practices (e.g., seva, naam japo) that help achieve liberation.

# 1.6.3e Sikh practices

## Learners should understand:

The importance of mourning and funeral practices:

- giving thanks to the Waheguru for that person's life
- celebrating and remembering the life of the person and their soul reuniting with God

- using signs and symbols to express a deeper meaning
- showing the link between this life and Sikh beliefs about life, death and reincarnation
- remembering that death is not the end of life, but a stage of life between existence and rebirth.

## Sikh mourning practices:

- no formal mourning custom, but there are expressions of grief
- providing a supportive environment for those who are grieving
- charitable acts in memory of the deceased, such as organising a langar or making donations to the community, reflecting the Sikh value of seva (selfless service).

Learners should know that in Sikhism funerals are a time to give thanks to Waheguru for the deceased's life and celebrate their soul's journey.

Sikhs believe that the soul reunites with Waheguru, moving beyond the cycle of samsara (birth, death, and rebirth) or progressing towards mukti (liberation).

Funerals are rooted in the understanding that life and death are divine processes governed by Waheguru's will (hukam).

## Practices and Symbols:

- Sikh funerals involve readings from the Guru Granth Sahib and singing hymns (Shabads) that celebrate God's mercy and the departed soul's spiritual journey.
- The body is cremated, symbolising the impermanence of the physical form and the eternal nature of the soul.

Sikhs see death is a transition, a stage of life rather than an end.

Funeral attendees wear white to signify purity and peace and no elaborate mourning rituals are performed. Sikh mourning practices are rooted in compassion and support, without rigid formalities around grief. People express their emotions freely and the community comes together to comfort and help those who are grieving. A key part of remembering the deceased is through seva selfless service. Families often organise a langar (a community meal) or make charitable donations in their loved one's memory. These acts not only honour the departed but also strengthen bonds within the community, reflecting the Sikh values of kindness, generosity and humility. It's a way of finding meaning and connection in a time of loss.

- Symbols Activity: Examine the use of white clothing and cremation as symbols of purity and the soul's release.
- Reflective Discussion: Encourage learners to think about how these practices embody Sikh teachings on reincarnation and mukti.
- Creative Work: Ask learners to create a 'life map' showing how Sikh beliefs guide every stage of life, including death.

Learners should know that Sikh cremation rite – Antan Sanskaar, reflects belief in the soul's eternal nature. Sikh funeral practices, known as Antam Sanskaar (final rites), focus on simplicity, dignity and the acceptance of God's will. Cremation is the preferred practice, symbolising the body's return to nature and the release of the soul as part of the cycle of birth, death and rebirth. Prayers and hymns from the Guru Granth Sahib are recited to bring comfort and peace. The Antim Ardas (final prayer) concludes the funeral, asking for blessings on the departed soul's journey to the Divine in the hope that it has reached mukti and returns to Waheguru. A few days later, the Bhog ceremony is held, with scripture readings and a langar (community meal). This gathering brings people together to support one another, honour the departed, and find strength in faith and community and is part of the mourning process.

The role, significance and features of the following sites of Sikh pilgrimage:

- Amritsar
- Anandpur Sahib.

the Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib), is the heart of Sikh spirituality. It's a place of peace and equality, where millions come every year to pray and reflect. Surrounded by the sacred pool (Amrit Sarovar), the temple's golden beauty and the continuous recitation of the Guru Granth Sahib create a calming and uplifting experience.

Anandpur Sahib: Birthplace of the Khalsa, where Guru Gobind Singh initiated the Sikh warrior-saints. It symbolises courage, devotion and Sikh identity. Anandpur Sahib, known as the "Holy City of Bliss", is deeply meaningful to Sikhs. It's where Guru Gobind Singh created the Khalsa in 1699, shaping Sikh identity. Pilgrims visit its historic gurdwaras, especially during Hola Mohalla, to connect with their faith and history. Anandpur Sahib is a place of inspiration, devotion, and cultural celebration.

## At Anandpur Sahib, Sikhs:

- Engage in spiritual reflection, prayer, and connect with the rich history of their faith.
- Pilgrims visit its historic gurdwaras, such as *Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib*, one of the five seats of Sikh authority, where Guru Gobind Singh established the Khalsa in 1699.
- They listen to hymns, partake in the community kitchen (langar), and reflect on the teachings of the Gurus.
- During *Hola Mohalla*, a vibrant annual festival, Sikhs gather for displays of martial arts, mock battles and processions, showcasing the spirit of bravery and community.

Sikh identity and belonging expressed through symbolic actions - the 5Ks:

{137}------------------------------------------------

## The significance of the 5Ks:

- Kesh
- Kara
- Kanga
- Kaccha
- Kirpan.

## Suggested Learning Activities:

• Learners could draw and/or label a bird's eye view of each place of pilgrimage and annotate with reasons why the features are at each of the sites of pilgrimage, e.g. pool of nectar at Amritsar, allowing devotees to bathe and purify themselves.

Learners should know the items of identity and why Sikhs choose to wear the items collectively, as well as the symbolic meaning behind each item.

The 5Ks are physical symbols of Sikh identity, reflecting spiritual values and the commitment of initiated Sikhs (Khalsa) to their faith:

- Kesh (uncut hair): Symbolises respect for God's creation and spiritual devotion. This is the uncut hair and beard, symbolising the rejection of pride and the appreciation of God's gift of creation.
- Kara (steel bracelet): Represents unity with God and moral restraint. It also reminds them that God is eternal.
- Kanga (wooden comb): Emphasises cleanliness and order in life. This is the comb that reminds them that God is there to remove the tangles from their life and can always be turned to.
- Kaccha (cotton undergarments): These shorts remind them of the clothes worn by soldiers who fought for the faith. They also symbolise sexual restraint.
- Kirpan (ceremonial sword): Signifies courage, protection of the weak and the protection of those who are oppressed, it also symbolises the fight for justice.

Sikhs adopt the 5Ks for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to:

- As it was instructed by Guru Gobind Singh.
- As a sign of Sikh identity and belonging.
- To show they are Amritdhari (initiated Sikhs) who have undergone Amrit Sanskar (the initiation ceremony).

# 1.8.2 Non-religious perspectives on life and death 1.8.3 Non-religious practices

## Learners should understand:

Non-religious perspectives on life and death, including:

- death as an end of existence
- no future reward or punishment
- the significance and value of having no belief in the soul or life after death.

Non-religious perspectives on life and death often emphasize the material and finite nature of existence, focusing on the here and now rather than an afterlife. Life is viewed as an opportunity for personal growth, relationships and contributing to society or the planet. Nonreligious people often believe that humans have no spiritual dimension, and therefore death is seen as a natural end to consciousness and the physical body. There is no evidence of an afterlife and no judgement based on earthly actions. The physical body is recycled into the environment. This may inspire individuals to cherish the present life greatly and leave a positive legacy. Without belief in an afterlife, meaning is often derived from human experiences, accomplishments, and the impact a person has on others and the world around them. Non-religious people may suggest that humans should live morally good lives because it shows compassion for others and respect for self.

Learners should understand:

Non-religious mourning practices, including:

- no specific, agreed mourning customs
- mourning as an expression of grief
- celebration and remembrance of the life of the deceased
- mourning as providing a supportive environment for those who are grieving.

Non-religious funeral practices, including:

- no specific, agreed burial or cremation structure
- celebrant may lead a service
- eulogy may be given as a celebration of life
- music is usually used during the service.

For non-religious people there are no specific, agreed mourning customs and people will express their grief in a way that feels appropriate for them and their loved one. Family and friends will provide a supportive environment for those who are grieving the loss of a loved one. They will often hold a ceremony to mark the end of the loved one's life, and this is usually a celebration and remembrance of the life of the deceased.

Many people choose to have a non-religious funeral service. This may be a personal ceremony where the music and readings have no mention of God or an afterlife. The ceremony may be led by a nonreligious or Humanist celebrant (this is a person who leads the ceremony and may help the family to tailor the ceremony to the wishes of the individuals involved). The ceremony will focus on the life of the person who has died, reflecting on their qualities, the life they led and their achievements. Each person will make a unique contribution to the world and this will be the focus of the ceremony. An unusual coffin may be chosen to reflect a special aspect of the life of the person who has died, and there will often be a eulogy

given by a family member or a friend. The people present may light candles as a symbolic act and there may be moments of quiet reflection. The music or songs may reflect the interests of the person and there may be non-religious readings, such as poetry. A nonreligious funeral could be a burial or a cremation and will provide a supportive environment for any loved ones who are grieving their loss. However, there is no specific agreed burial or cremation structure, and people will have the celebration they feel is appropriate for their loved one.

They advocate for compassion, justice and the well-being of others, often placing emphasis on individual responsibility and the betterment of humanity.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Incarnation                         | 'Made flesh' - the Christian belief that God became man in the person of Jesus, fully human and fully divine. God becoming human in the form of Jesus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Inconsistent Triad                  | JL Mackie identified the 'inconsistent triad', where he suggested that the following three (triad) things are inconsistent as they cannot all be true at the same time: if God is omnipotent (all-powerful) and omnibenevolent (all-loving), then evil would not exist. However, we have experienced evil and know that it exists. Therefore, either God is not all-powerful because he cannot stop suffering, or he is not all-loving because he doesn't want to stop suffering. This dilemma is called the Problem of Evil.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Liberal                             | Liberal Christians see the Bible more as a personal guide to living a life pleasing to God, rather than something to be strictly followed. They may suggest that the Bible is written about God and contains useful information to help believers understand their faith better but that, as it was written by humans inspired by God, it could contain errors. For example, the creation story in Genesis simply helps humans to understand that God is the creator of the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Literal                             | Some Christians are called literalists and believe that every word of the Bible is literally true. For example, a literalist would believe that God created the world in six days (24-hour periods) and created a man on the sixth day and made a woman out of man's rib as this is how the first two chapters of the book of Genesis described it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

If humans turn back to God, then they will be in Heaven (soul-deciding theodicy)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Soul-making Theodicy                | Saint Irenaeus believed that God made mankind in his 'image to grow into his likeness'. God allows humans to suffer so that humans grow to be more like him. God has given humans free will and we can make good or bad choices. Irenaeus believed that all humans will be in heaven (soul-making theodicy).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Holy Communion                      | Holy Communion refers to the Eucharist, the sacrament by which Christians receive spiritual nourishment in the bread and wine. It fosters unity with Christ and fellowship with the community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Humanist                            | Humanists do not believe in any gods or divine beings. They often emphasise the value of human beings and seek to promote human flourishing through reason, science and ethical principles. Humanists typically believe that meaning, purpose and morality are derived from human experience and the development of society rather than religious sources. They advocate for compassion, justice and the well-being of others, often placing emphasis on individual responsibility and the betterment of humanity.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Imago Dei                           | 'In the image of God'. The belief that human beings are uniquely a reflection of God's personhood.

| Incarnation                         | 'Made flesh' - the Christian belief that God became man in the person of Jesus, fully human and fully divine. God becoming human in the form of Jesus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Inconsistent Triad                  | JL Mackie identified the 'inconsistent triad', where he suggested that the following three (triad) things are inconsistent as they cannot all be true at the same time: if God is omnipotent (all-powerful) and omnibenevolent (all-loving), then evil would not exist. However, we have experienced evil and know that it exists. Therefore, either God is not all-powerful because he cannot stop suffering, or he is not all-loving because he doesn't want to stop suffering. This dilemma is called the Problem of Evil.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Liberal                             | Liberal Christians see the Bible more as a personal guide to living a life pleasing to God, rather than something to be strictly followed. They may suggest that the Bible is written about God and contains useful information to help believers understand their faith better, but that as it was written by humans inspired by God, it could contain errors. For example, the Creation story in Genesis simply helps humans to understand that God is the Creator of the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Literal                             | Some Christians are called literalists and believe that every word of the Bible is literally true. For example, a literalist would believe that God created the world in six days (24-hour periods) and created a man on the sixth day and made a woman out of man's rib as this is how the first two chapters of the book of Genesis described it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Inconsistent Triad | JL Mackie identified the 'inconsistent triad', where he suggested that the following three (triad) things are inconsistent as they cannot all be true at the same time: if God is omnipotent (all-powerful) and omnibenevolent (all-loving), then evil would not exist. However, we have experienced evil and know that it exists. Therefore, either God is not all-powerful because he cannot stop suffering, or he is not all-loving because he doesn't want to stop suffering. This dilemma is called the Problem of Evil.               |
