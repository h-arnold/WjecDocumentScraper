INTRODUCTION

1.1  Aims

GCSE Religious Studies supports learners to:

•  develop knowledge and understanding of religious and non-religious beliefs,

values, teachings, practices, and philosophical convictions

•  engage with contrasting lived religious and non-religious experiences
•  develop curiosity about the purpose of life
•  explore ways in which religious and non-religious ethical and philosophical

convictions have influenced human experience and society

•  explore evidence from a range of religious and non-religious sources that engage

with philosophical, ethical, and moral issues

•  appreciate the complex, pluralistic and diverse nature of society by understanding

the need for tolerance, resilience, and empathy
reflect on their own values, beliefs, and perspectives and those of others

•
•  align with aspects of the Religion, values and ethics statutory guidance to enable

learners to:
•  develop an awareness of self in relation to others
•  make connections to the wider and natural world
•  develop creativity and curiosity
•  explore ultimate questions and contemplate meaning and purpose

•  make sense of and interpret human experience, the natural world, and their own

place within it, from a pluralistic perspective, understanding different religions and
non-religious philosophical convictions in their own locality and in Wales,
developing their sense of cynefin, as well as in the wider world.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales’ Approval Criteria.

1.2  Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Religious Studies qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for
Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to
make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification.
Central to this design are the principles of progression, along with the statements of
what matters and those subject specific skills and concepts outlined in the ‘Designing
your Curriculum’ section of the Humanities Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to
embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral
skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple
mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for
Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for
integrating the learning experiences noted on page 82, the Guidance for Teaching
will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

GCSE RELIGIOUS STUDIES 7

The GCSE Religious Studies qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:
•  supporting the statements of what matters1, giving learners the opportunity to:
•  gain a deeper understanding of the concepts underpinning humanities, and

their application in local, national and global contexts

•  understand human experiences better
•

learn how various worldviews and factors can influence their own and others’
perceptions and interpretations

•  develop an appreciation of how contexts influence the constructions of

narratives and representations

•  develop an understanding of the complex, pluralistic and diverse nature of

societies

•  appreciate the interplay between a range of factors, including religious and

non-religious beliefs and worldviews

•  develop a common understanding of the ethnic diversity, identities,

experiences and perspectives of their local area, Wales and the wider world

•  explore and develop a tolerant and empathetic understanding of the varied

beliefs, values, traditions and ethics that underpin and shape human society

•  supporting the principles of progression2 by encouraging learners to:

•  ask increasingly sophisticated enquiry questions
•  engage with an increasing breadth and depth of knowledge and underlying

concepts

•  make supported judgements in more complex contexts
•  build an increasingly clear and coherent understanding of the world around

them

•  move on to more focused awareness of the lives of others, in their own social

context and elsewhere in the world

•  use evidence to construct and support an answer and relating that to

representation and interpretation of enquiry results.

The construct of the GCSE Religious Studies qualification is based on the Welsh
Government subject specific considerations for Religious Studies3. The qualification
provides:
•  opportunities to understand religious and non-religious beliefs, teachings,

practices, philosophical convictions, values and experiences from a local, national
and international perspective

•  opportunities to seek answers to ultimate philosophical questions, such as the

purpose and meaning of life

•  opportunities to explore the foundations of religious and non-religious viewpoints
and the influence of religious and non-religious philosophical convictions on our
pluralistic and diverse society over time
learners with the skills to explore philosophical and moral issues, reflect on their
own beliefs and values, and the beliefs and values of others

•

•  opportunities to develop empathy, creativity, curiosity, resilience, tolerance, a

sense of cynefin and human experiences within the natural world.

Please note – as explained in Qualifications Wales' report on their outcomes on the
Approval Criteria consultation

1.3  Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is
designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the
conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages
3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills
and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares
learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation
for the study of Religious Studies at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification
provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do
not progress to further study in this subject.

1.4  Guided learning hours

GCSE Religious Studies has been designed to be delivered within 120 – 140 guided
learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme
for learners in years 10 and 11.

1.5  Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our
language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect
and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and
adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising
that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to
ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres
of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always
be on the website.

1.6  Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic,
religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible,
features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access
and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual
orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to
enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills
without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the
following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access
Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This
document is available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of
provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete
barrier to any part of the assessment.

animals in scientific and medical research:
•

there is no explicit prohibition against using animals in
scientific and medical research

•  many Sikhs see human life as ultimately of more value

than animal life

•  any research using animals would need to be balanced

against the Sikh value of ahimsa

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

5.1  Entries and awards

This is a unitised qualification. Learners are entered for each unit separately.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series each year, until the
end of the life of the specification.

Unit 1, Unit 2 and Unit 3 will be available in 2026 (and each year thereafter). Unit 4
will be available in 2027 (and each year thereafter) and the qualification will be
awarded for the first time in summer 2027.

Pre-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or under on 31st August in the
academic year in which they were entered)

The terminal rule is set at 40% of the overall qualification for Pre-16 Candidates for
GCSE Religious Studies.

If the assessment being re-taken contributes to the 40% terminal rule requirement,
the mark for the new assessment will count regardless of previous results in that
assessment.

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score
from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade subject to the
terminal rule being satisfied first i.e. that candidates must complete 40% of the
assessment for a qualification in the series in which they are cashing in.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the
third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s).
This is referred to as a 'fresh start'. When retaking a qualification (fresh start), a
candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from
examination units taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating the new
grade(s).

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not
count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in
the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be used for the life of the specification.

Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1st September in the
academic year in which they are entered)

There is no terminal rule that applies to Post-16 Candidates for GCSE Religious
Studies.

There is no limit on the number of times a candidate can resit an individual unit;
however, the better uniform mark score from the most two recent attempts will be
used in calculating the final overall grade.

The ‘fresh start’ rule does not apply to post-16 candidates.

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not
count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in
the final resit series.
