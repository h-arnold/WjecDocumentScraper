# GCSE RELIGIOUS STUDIES

# <span id="page-6-0"></span>1 INTRODUCTION

#### <span id="page-6-1"></span>1.1 Aims

GCSE Religious Studies supports learners to:

- develop knowledge and understanding of religious and non-religious beliefs, values, teachings, practices, and philosophical convictions
- engage with contrasting lived religious and non-religious experiences
- develop curiosity about the purpose of life
- explore ways in which religious and non-religious ethical and philosophical convictions have influenced human experience and society
- explore evidence from a range of religious and non-religious sources that engage with philosophical, ethical, and moral issues
- appreciate the complex, pluralistic and diverse nature of society by understanding the need for tolerance, resilience, and empathy
- reflect on their own values, beliefs, and perspectives and those of others
- align with aspects of the Religion, values and ethics statutory guidance to enable learners to:
  - develop an awareness of self in relation to others
  - make connections to the wider and natural world
  - develop creativity and curiosity
  - explore ultimate questions and contemplate meaning and purpose
- make sense of and interpret human experience, the natural world, and their own place within it, from a pluralistic perspective, understanding different religions and non-religious philosophical convictions in their own locality and in Wales, developing their sense of cynefin, as well as in the wider world.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales' Approval Criteria.

#### <span id="page-6-2"></span>1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Religious Studies qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/statements-of-what-matters/)  [what matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/statements-of-what-matters/) and those [subject specific skills and concepts](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area) outlined in the '[Designing](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/designing-your-curriculum/)  [your Curriculum](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/designing-your-curriculum/)' section of the Humanities Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted on page 82, the Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery. 

{7}------------------------------------------------

The GCSE Religious Studies qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:

- supporting the statements of what matters[1](#page-7-0) , giving learners the opportunity to:
  - gain a deeper understanding of the concepts underpinning humanities, and their application in local, national and global contexts
  - understand human experiences better
  - learn how various worldviews and factors can influence their own and others' perceptions and interpretations
  - develop an appreciation of how contexts influence the constructions of narratives and representations
  - develop an understanding of the complex, pluralistic and diverse nature of societies
  - appreciate the interplay between a range of factors, including religious and non-religious beliefs and worldviews
  - develop a common understanding of the ethnic diversity, identities, experiences and perspectives of their local area, Wales and the wider world
  - explore and develop a tolerant and empathetic understanding of the varied beliefs, values, traditions and ethics that underpin and shape human society
- supporting the principles of progression[2](#page-7-1) by encouraging learners to:
  - ask increasingly sophisticated enquiry questions
  - engage with an increasing breadth and depth of knowledge and underlying concepts
  - make supported judgements in more complex contexts
  - build an increasingly clear and coherent understanding of the world around them
  - move on to more focused awareness of the lives of others, in their own social context and elsewhere in the world
  - use evidence to construct and support an answer and relating that to representation and interpretation of enquiry results.

The construct of the GCSE Religious Studies qualification is based on the Welsh Government subject specific considerations for Religious Studies[3](#page-7-2) . The qualification provides:

- opportunities to understand religious and non-religious beliefs, teachings, practices, philosophical convictions, values and experiences from a local, national and international perspective
- opportunities to seek answers to ultimate philosophical questions, such as the purpose and meaning of life
- opportunities to explore the foundations of religious and non-religious viewpoints and the influence of religious and non-religious philosophical convictions on our pluralistic and diverse society over time
- learners with the skills to explore philosophical and moral issues, reflect on their own beliefs and values, and the beliefs and values of others
- opportunities to develop empathy, creativity, curiosity, resilience, tolerance, a sense of cynefin and human experiences within the natural world.

Please note – as explained in Qualifications Wales' report on their outcomes on the Approval Criteria consultation

[\[https://qualifications.wales/media/knaphlc0/consultation-outcomes-by-subject.pdf\]](https://qualifications.wales/media/knaphlc0/consultation-outcomes-by-subject.pdf), GCSE Religious Studies is not designed to cover all aspects of RVE guidance.

<span id="page-7-1"></span><sup>2</sup> <https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/principles-of-progression/>

<span id="page-7-2"></span><sup>3</sup> <https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area>

{8}------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="page-8-0"></span>1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of Religious Studies at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

### <span id="page-8-1"></span>1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE Religious Studies has been designed to be delivered within 120 – 140 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

### <span id="page-8-2"></span>1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

#### <span id="page-8-3"></span>1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website [\(www.jcq.org.uk\)](http://www.jcq.org.uk/).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

{9}------------------------------------------------

# <span id="page-9-0"></span>2 SUBJECT CONTENT

#### How to read the amplification

The amplification provided in the right-hand column uses the following three stems:

- 'Learners should understand' is used when learners are required to demonstrate and apply knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and can synthesise and evaluate information for a given purpose.
- 'Learners should have a basic understanding' is used when learners do not need to understand all aspects of the specified content in detail. Teachers should refer to Guidance for Teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and breadth to which this content should be taught.
- 'Learners should be able to' is used when learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to source material or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques.

#### **Centres must teach:**

• **either** Christianity **or** Catholic Christianity

#### **and**

- **one** world religion from the following list:
  - Buddhism
  - Hinduism

- vegetarianism avoids industrial farming which can lead to climate change/environmental damage
- the concept of 'Right Livelihood' teaches that Buddhists should avoid work that involves killing or harming animals.

Buddhist perspectives on the use of animals in scientific and medical research:

- many Buddhists agree with the UK Animal Welfare Sentience Act of 2022
- experimenting on animals is morally wrong if the animal concerned might come to any harm
- many acknowledge the value that animal experiments may have for human health
- some would point to drugs tested on animals damaging human health
- the experimenter must accept the negative karma of carrying out the experiment
- experiment only for a morally good purpose
- experiment only on animals where there is no alternative
- design the experiment to do as little harm as possible
- avoid killing the animal unless it is absolutely necessary
- treat the animals kindly and respectfully.

• the cow is particularly revered and protected (Gau Mata).

Hindu beliefs and teachings about the use of animals for human benefit:

- many practise vegetarianism, such as ISKCON, thereby adhering to ahimsa, and out of respect for animal life; Manu Smriti 5:48
- the Mahabharata reflects the Hindu view that the cow should be protected and honoured, the practice of factory farming directly contradicts the principle of ahimsa

Hindu beliefs and teachings about the use of animals in scientific and medical research:

- diverse views exist within Hinduism
- some Hindus may accept the use of animals in research if it is for the greater good and conducted with minimal harm
- others may oppose it outright on the grounds of ahimsa and the impact of negative karma
- many advocate for alternative methods to animal testing that align with ahimsa.

- the rights of people with disabilities
- the rights of refugee and asylum seekers.

The themes will be set by WJEC annually and available via the WJEC Portal in September of the second year of study and every year thereafter.

Centres will choose two human rights issues as the focus of the non-examination assessment tasks.

The assessment must be based on the two religions studied in all other units (Christianity or Catholic Christianity and a world religion) and non-religious perspectives.

## <span id="page-87-0"></span>4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for GCSE Religious Studies.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our [Guide to preventing, reporting and](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)  [investigating malpractice.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC [\(malpractice@wjec.co.uk\)](mailto:malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

<span id="page-87-1"></span>In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet [Suspected](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)  [Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)

### 5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

#### <span id="page-88-0"></span>5.1 Entries and awards

This is a unitised qualification. Learners are entered for each unit separately.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series each year, until the end of the life of the specification.

Unit 1, Unit 2 and Unit 3 will be available in 2026 (and each year thereafter). Unit 4 will be available in 2027 (and each year thereafter) and the qualification will be awarded for the first time in summer 2027.

Pre-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or under on 31st August in the academic year in which they were entered)

The terminal rule is set at 40% of the overall qualification for Pre-16 Candidates for GCSE Religious Studies.

If the assessment being re-taken contributes to the 40% terminal rule requirement, the mark for the new assessment will count regardless of previous results in that assessment.

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade subject to the terminal rule being satisfied first i.e. that candidates must complete 40% of the assessment for a qualification in the series in which they are cashing in.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s). This is referred to as a 'fresh start'. When retaking a qualification (fresh start), a candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from examination units taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating the new grade(s).

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be used for the life of the specification.

Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1st September in the academic year in which they are entered)

There is no terminal rule that applies to Post-16 Candidates for GCSE Religious Studies.

There is no limit on the number of times a candidate can resit an individual unit; however, the better uniform mark score from the most two recent attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade.

The 'fresh start' rule does not apply to post-16 candidates.

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.
