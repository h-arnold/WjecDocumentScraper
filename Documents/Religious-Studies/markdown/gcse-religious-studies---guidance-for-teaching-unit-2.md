Overview of Unit 2

Religion and relationships
(20% of the qualification)

The purpose of this unit is to:
•  develop and apply knowledge and understanding of religious beliefs, teachings and

practices relating to relationships

•  explore information and perspectives relating to religious and non-religious beliefs, and

relationships

•  analyse and evaluate different religious and non-religious perspectives towards

relationships
reflect on personal values and beliefs relating to relationships.

•

Overview of arrangements for non-examination assessment

Each year, WJEC will select two of the following set themes and will provide a statement
associated with each theme:

a)  Marriage, adultery, divorce and remarriage
b)  Artificial contraception and natural family planning
c)  Cohabitation and sex before and outside marriage
d)  Same-sex relationships, civil partnerships and same-sex marriage
e)  Interfaith relationships and marriage outside the religious tradition
f)  Roles within family, including gender roles within relationships
g)  Religious upbringing, childhood ceremonies and faith-based schooling.

The themes and associated statements will be set by WJEC annually and available via the
WJEC Portal in September during the first year of study and every year thereafter.

Centres will choose one theme and an associated statement as the focus of the non-
examination assessment tasks.

The assessment must be based on the two religions studied in all other units (Christianity or
Catholic Christianity and a world religion), and non-religious beliefs.

This assessment contributes to 20% of the overall qualification grade.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be marked by the
centre and moderated by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be
handwritten and scanned or completed digitally).

In this unit, learners will develop knowledge, skills and understanding in:

Content Amplification

Teacher Guidance

2.1.1
Beliefs, teachings,
practices and
perspectives
relating to
relationships

Learners should understand:
•

religious beliefs, teachings, practices and
perspectives relating to relationships
•  non-religious perspectives relating to

relationships.

The centre will need to decide which theme, out of the two themes set
by WJEC for the year, they are going to study.

Ensure that teachers and learners have a clear understanding of the
statement associated with the chosen theme. This will support the
centre and the learner to recognise the focus for their research.

Learners will focus on one of two themes set
annually by WJEC from the following list:

Task 1

a)  Marriage, adultery, divorce and remarriage
b)  Artificial contraception and natural family

planning

c)  Cohabitation and sex before and outside

marriage

d)  Same-sex relationships, civil partnerships and

same-sex marriage

e)  Interfaith relationships and marriage outside

the religious tradition

f)  Roles within family, including gender roles

within relationships

g)  Religious upbringing, childhood ceremonies

and faith-based schooling.

This research work is required to complete the requirements of task
one of the NEA. It is important to recognise that there is a restriction
of four sides of A4 notes, this needs to include all research from
Christianity or Catholic Christianity, the second religion and non-
religious perspectives.

Each learner will need to complete this work individually and
independently.

Task 1 has a completion time of 1 hour and 30 minutes. This work is
to be completed under indirect supervision.

The learner will need to:
•  summarise the relevant beliefs, teachings, practices and
perspectives of the two religions studied in relation to the
statement provided

•  summarise the relevant non-religious beliefs and perspectives in

relation to the statement provided.

This piece of work focuses on Assessment Objective 2 (Apply
knowledge and understanding of religious and non-religious beliefs,
teachings, practices, values, and philosophical convictions) and is
centre marked out of 15 marks.

If the learner is part of the sample submitted to WJEC their research
notes will have to be submitted with their final work for moderation.

An understanding of religious beliefs, teachings, practices and
perspectives relating to relationships from Christianity or Catholic
Christianity will be needed to access this work. The focus should be
on the theme that the centre has chosen to focus on from the pre-
released information.

It is important to consider diverse views and perspectives within
Christianity or Catholic Christianity.

An understanding of religious beliefs, teachings, practices and
perspectives relating to relationships from the centre’s second religion
will be needed to access this work. The focus should be on the theme
that your centre has chosen to focus on from the pre-released
information.

It is important to consider diverse views and perspectives within your
centre’s second religion.

An understanding of non-religious perspectives related to
relationships will be needed to access this work. The focus should be
on the theme that your centre has chosen to focus from the pre-
released information.

It is important to consider diverse views and perspectives within non-
religious perspectives.

  GCSE Religious Studies Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching  7

Consideration of sources of authority from both religious and non-
religious perspectives will be needed as evidence to support their
views and beliefs.

The quality of the notes the candidate makes at this stage are
important because they will use them later to address other parts of
the assessment.

Task 2

This work forms task 2 of the NEA. Making use of the notes made in
preparation for task 1 and their task 1 answer, the learner now needs
to consider the similarities and differences between the different
religions and between the religions and non-religious perspectives.

2.1.2
Similarities and
differences in
perspectives
relating to
relationships

Learners should understand the similarities and
differences in beliefs, teachings, practices and
perspectives relating to relationships, including:
•  between different religions
•  between religions and non-religious

perspectives.

Learners should have a basic understanding of:
the changing landscape of religious belief in
•
the context of relationships

•  where appropriate, relevant changes to UK

law linked to relationships

The learner needs to examine the similarities and differences in
beliefs, teachings, practices and perspectives including:
•  any similarities between the two religions studied
•  any differences between the two religions studied
•  any similarities between each religion and the non-religious

•  how the changing landscape of religious belief

perspectives

and changes in relevant UK law, where
appropriate, interconnect.

•  any differences between each religion and the non-religious

perspectives.

The submitted work needs to be competed under direct supervision
and should take one hour.

This work focuses on Assessment Objective 3 (Analyse, evaluate, or
make judgements on a variety of ethical and moral issues, religious
and non-religious beliefs, teachings, practices, values, and
philosophical convictions) and is centre marked out of 10 marks.

If the learner is part of the sample their work will be submitted to the
WJEC for moderation.
This section naturally follows on from 2.1.1.

  GCSE Religious Studies Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching  8

Learners will be unable to make comparisons until they know the
beliefs, teachings, practices and perspectives (both religious and non-
religious). Once this is understood the centre can support learners to
make comparisons. There is a need to compare:
•  within Christianity or Catholic Christianity
•  within the centre’s second religion
•  within non-religious perspectives
•  across Christianity or Catholic Christianity and the centre’s

second religion

•  across Christianity or Catholic Christianity and non-religious

perspectives

•  across the centre’s second religion and non-religious

perspectives.

Clear consideration will need to be given to how religious beliefs have
changed over time as society, laws and attitudes have changed.

There is a need to consider any changes in legislation, UK law and
any Wales-specific legislation around relationships, such as:
•  marriage laws
•  divorce laws
•  contraception laws – legalisation of the pill
•  civil partnership laws
•  same sex marriage laws
•  education laws including faith-based schooling
•  Equalities Act 2010.

Consideration also needs to be given to the effects of the changes in
law and attitudes and the response of religion to these changes, such
as:
•  changes in contraception law and the changing attitudes of

religious believers to the use of contraception

•  same sex marriage and being able to marry in a place of worship
the changing attitudes within some religious traditions towards

•

cohabitation
religious responses to interfaith relationships and marriage
outside the religious tradition
the changing roles within family, such as, gender roles within
relationships.

Whilst competing this section of work, it would be beneficial for
learners to consider their own thoughts, views and beliefs in relation
to relationships to assist them in developing their own values, beliefs
and views in preparation for task 5 of the NEA.

This work will all link to task 2 of the NEA. It is important to recognise
that learners will only be able to make use of the four sides of A4
notes and their answer to task 1 whilst completing this work.

2.2.1
Selecting or
producing suitable
sources

Learners should be able to:
•  select or produce suitable sources to gain
insights into religious and non-religious
perspectives and experiences
•  explain relevant reasons for selecting

sources, such as:
•

to provide clear information, supported by
reasoning and/or evidence
to prove the reliability of another source
used
to provide a different perspective leading
to greater understanding
to help diminish any bias
to provide a different source type, leading
to greater understanding
to provide evidence of lived experience.

Task 3

This section focuses on learners’ ability, supported by teachers, to
select or produce suitable sources to help them complete the NEA.
As such, centres need to support learners in recognising appropriate
sources for use.

This work will be collated and used within task 3 of the NEA.

Learners are asked, based on the statement provided, to explain why
they have selected or produced each source. In their answer, they
could refer to one or more of the following:
•

to provide clear information, supported by reasoning and/or
evidence
to prove the reliability of another source used
to provide a different perspective leading to greater understanding
to help diminish any bias
to provide a different source type, leading to greater
understanding
to provide evidence of lived experience.

Learners are restricted to no more than six pages of sources. These
must be retained by the centre, and submitted with the candidate’s
work for moderation should the learner be part of the sample.

This work should be indirectly supervised and should take 1 hour.

This work focuses on Assessment Objective 4 (Select, use and apply
skills and techniques in practice relevant to the study of Religious
Studies) and is centre marked out of 10 marks.

If the learner is part of the sample their work will be submitted to the
WJEC for moderation.

There is a need to ensure that there are sources from the different
perspectives:
•  Christianity or Catholic Christianity
•
•  non-religious perspectives.

the second religion chosen by the centre

A range of sources is needed to show diversity within the different
perspectives.

Relevant data on relationships is needed. This could include Census
data and/or data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) looking
at matters, such as:
•  marriage rates
•  divorce rates
•  birth rates
•

family type.

Centres need to ensure that learners do not exceed the total amount
of sources that can be used within this section of the NEA (A
maximum of six written or printed sources for use within task 3).

Sources that could be used include:
•  census data
•  documentaries
•
interviews
•  online sources
•  opinion polls
•  surveys.

  GCSE Religious Studies Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching  12

An understanding of how to recognise relevant sources is required.
Learners will need to consider:
•  what sources to use (both first hand and second hand)
•

the validity of their chosen sources – Have the sources come from
a trustworthy website, organisation or individual? Do we know
who has written the source? Is it a first hand or second-hand
source?
the reliability of their sources – Is the source current? Is any data
included referenced? Is the data included current? Is the
information shared reflective of current thinking of organisations
mentioned in the source?

•

•

•  The relevance of the content of the chosen sources – Does the
source contribute to the relationships issue being considered?
the importance of collating a range of sources for different
purposes – Has enough variety of sources been used?
recognising if a source contains bias – Do the sources only speak
from one perspective? Has the source been written for a particular
audience, reason or to shock?

•

•  ensuring that the source contains evidence of lived experience –
Is there a source that takes into consideration personal religious
views because of their religious beliefs and teachings? Personal
philosophical convictions of non-religious believers? professional
and non-professional?

Learners could consider techniques such as:
•  Social, Technological, Economic, Political, Legal and Ethical

(STEEPLE)

•  Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy and Purpose (CRAAP)
•  Reliable, Up-to-date, Relevant, Useful (RURU)

assist learners with focusing how to recognise suitable sources for
use.

Finding appropriate sources

It is important to incorporate a range of source types within the unit, so that learners are
familiar with, and equipped to analyse and evaluate, different sources and interpretations.

Sources can take a variety of forms, for example written documents, pictorial evidence or
oral accounts, however they must adhere to the guidelines relevant to the Unit/Task being
assessed.

The sources should be evaluated for their value to the set task. Encourage the candidates to
address issues such as:
•  What information does the source provide?
•  Does the source back up your knowledge?
•  Who was the author/maker?
•  When was the source written?
•  Why was it written?
•

Is there any doubt over the author/maker? Is he/she trustworthy?

Look at each source on its merits and avoid mechanical phrases and comments.

Primary Sources
These are original materials or documents, including (but not limited to) sacred texts, first
interpretations, books and sermons, writing by religious officials, etc.

Secondary Sources
These are materials that engage with and draw on primary sources through analysis,
interpretation or summarising. They are created after the primary sources. Examples include
(but are not limited to) documents such as published literature and review articles.

Where to find appropriate items
Centres might find useful items to use in their Unit on the following platforms:
•  The National Library of Wales [National Library of Wales - Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru]
•  People’s Collection Wales [The Collection | Peoples Collection Wales]
•  National Centre for Religious Education in Wales [National Centre for Religions

Education in Wales]
