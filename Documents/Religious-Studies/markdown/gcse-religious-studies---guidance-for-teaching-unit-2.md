# Overview of Unit 2

Religion and relationships (20% of the qualification)

The purpose of this unit is to:

- develop and apply knowledge and understanding of religious beliefs, teachings and practices relating to relationships
- explore information and perspectives relating to religious and non-religious beliefs, and relationships
- analyse and evaluate different religious and non-religious perspectives towards relationships
- reflect on personal values and beliefs relating to relationships.

## Overview of arrangements for non-examination assessment

Each year, WJEC will select **two** of the following set themes and will provide a statement associated with each theme:

- a) Marriage, adultery, divorce and remarriage
- b) Artificial contraception and natural family planning
- c) Cohabitation and sex before and outside marriage
- d) Same-sex relationships, civil partnerships and same-sex marriage
- e) Interfaith relationships and marriage outside the religious tradition
- f) Roles within family, including gender roles within relationships
- g) Religious upbringing, childhood ceremonies and faith-based schooling.

The themes and associated statements will be set by WJEC annually and available via the WJEC Portal in September during the first year of study and every year thereafter.

Centres will choose **one** theme and an associated statement as the focus of the nonexamination assessment tasks.

The assessment must be based on the **two** religions studied in all other units (Christianity or Catholic Christianity and a world religion), and non-religious beliefs.

This assessment contributes to 20% of the overall qualification grade.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be marked by the centre and moderated by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be handwritten and scanned or completed digitally).

{11}------------------------------------------------

Learners will be unable to make comparisons until they know the beliefs, teachings, practices and perspectives (both religious and non religious ). Once this is understood the centre can support learners to make comparisons. There is a need to compare:

- within Christianity or Catholic Christianity
- within the centre's second religion
- within non-religious perspectives
- across Christianity or Catholic Christianity and the centre's second religion
- across Christianity or Catholic Christianity and non -religious perspectives
- across the centre's second religion and non -religious perspectives.

Clear consideration will need to be given to how religious beliefs have changed over time as society, laws and attitudes have changed.

There is a need to consider any changes in legislation, UK law and any Wales -specific legislation around relationships, such as:

- marriage laws
- divorce laws
- contraception laws – legalisation of the pill
- civil partnership laws
- same sex marriage laws
- education laws including faith -based schooling
- Equalities Act 2010.

Consideration also needs to be given to the effects of the changes in law and attitudes and the response of religion to these changes, such as:

- changes in contraception law and the changing attitudes of religious believers to the use of contraception
- same sex marriage and being able to marry in a place of worship
- the changing attitudes within some religious traditions towards

{12}------------------------------------------------

cohabitation

- religious responses to interfaith relationships and marriage outside the religious tradition
- the changing roles within family, such as, gender roles within relationships.

Whilst competing this section of work, it would be beneficial for learners to consider their own thoughts, views and beliefs in relation to relationships to assist them in developing their own values, beliefs and views in preparation for task 5 of the NEA.

This work will all link to task 2 of the NEA. It is important to recognise that learners will only be able to make use of the four sides of A4 notes and their answer to task 1 whilst completing this work.

{13}------------------------------------------------

## Religious Studies skills

### Selecting or producing suitable sources

Learners should be able to:

- select or produce suitable sources to gain insights into religious and non-religious perspectives and experiences
- <span id="page-12-0"></span>• explain relevant reasons for selecting sources, such as:
  - to provide clear information, supported by reasoning and/or evidence
  - to prove the reliability of another source used
  - to provide a different perspective leading to greater understanding
  - to help diminish any bias
  - to provide a different source type, leading to greater understanding
  - to provide evidence of lived experience.

### Task 3

This section focuses on learners' ability, supported by teachers, to select or produce suitable sources to help them complete the NEA. As such, centres need to support learners in recognising appropriate sources for use.

This work will be collated and used within task 3 of the NEA.

Learners are asked, based on the statement provided, to explain why they have selected or produced each source. In their answer, they could refer to one or more of the following:

- to provide clear information, supported by reasoning and/or evidence
- to prove the reliability of another source used
- to provide a different perspective leading to greater understanding
- to help diminish any bias
- to provide a different source type, leading to greater understanding
- to provide evidence of lived experience.

Learners are restricted to no more than six pages of sources. These must be retained by the centre, and submitted with the candidate's work for moderation should the learner be part of the sample.

This work should be indirectly supervised and should take 1 hour.

This work focuses on Assessment Objective 4 (*Select, use and apply skills and techniques in practice relevant to the study of Religious Studies*) and is centre marked out of 10 marks.

If the learner is part of the sample their work will be submitted to the WJEC for moderation.

{14}------------------------------------------------

There is a need to ensure that there are sources from the different perspectives:

- Christianity or Catholic Christianity
- the second religion chosen by the centre
- non-religious perspectives.

A range of sources is needed to show diversity within the different perspectives.

Relevant data on relationships is needed. This could include Census data and/or data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) looking at matters, such as:

- marriage rates
- divorce rates
- birth rates
- family type.

Centres need to ensure that learners do not exceed the total amount of sources that can be used within this section of the NEA (*A maximum of six written or printed sources for use within task 3*).

Sources that could be used include:

- census data
- documentaries
- interviews
- online sources
- opinion polls
- surveys.

{15}------------------------------------------------

An understanding of how to recognise relevant sources is required. Learners will need to consider:

- what sources to use (both first hand and second hand)
- the validity of their chosen sources Have the sources come from a trustworthy website, organisation or individual? Do we know who has written the source? Is it a first hand or second-hand source?
- the reliability of their sources Is the source current? Is any data included referenced? Is the data included current? Is the information shared reflective of current thinking of organisations mentioned in the source?
- The relevance of the content of the chosen sources Does the source contribute to the relationships issue being considered?
- the importance of collating a range of sources for different purposes – Has enough variety of sources been used?
- recognising if a source contains bias Do the sources only speak from one perspective? Has the source been written for a particular audience, reason or to shock?
- ensuring that the source contains evidence of lived experience Is there a source that takes into consideration personal religious views because of their religious beliefs and teachings? Personal philosophical convictions of non-religious believers? professional and non-professional?

Learners could consider techniques such as:

- Social, Technological, Economic, Political, Legal and Ethical (STEEPLE)
- Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy and Purpose (CRAAP)
- Reliable, Up-to-date, Relevant, Useful (RURU) assist learners with focusing how to recognise suitable sources for use.

| 2.2.2            |
|------------------|
| Using sources to |
| support a        |
| judgement        |

Learners should be able to use relevant sources:

- to analyse and evaluate religious and nonreligious perspectives about relationships
- to reach a judgement

### Task 4

This section focuses on task 4 of the NEA.

Learners are required to analyse and evaluate the statement provided. They must refer to religious and non-religious beliefs, teachings, practices and perspectives in their answer.

Learners can make use of the following to complete this piece of work:

- a maximum of four sides of A4 written or typed research notes that they have used for task 1 and 2
- a maximum of six written or printed sources that they have used for task 3
- their own answers for tasks 1, 2, 3.

This work should be completed under supervision and should take two hours.

This work focuses on Assessment Objective 3 (*Analyse, evaluate, or make judgements on a variety of ethical and moral issues, religious and non-religious beliefs,* teachings, practices, values, and philosophical convictions) and is centre marked out of 20 marks.

This work must be retained by the centre, and submitted with the candidate's work should it be required for moderation.

Prior to learners completing this task in the NEA, teachers will need to support and guide them with how to analyse and evaluate the different perspectives from both religious and non-religious perspectives on relationships and how to make judgements on these perspectives (if not previously competed as part of 2.1.1).

# Finding appropriate sources

It is important to incorporate a range of source types within the unit, so that learners are familiar with, and equipped to analyse and evaluate, different sources and interpretations.

Sources can take a variety of forms, for example written documents, pictorial evidence or oral accounts, however they must adhere to the guidelines relevant to the Unit/Task being assessed.

The sources should be evaluated for their value to the set task. Encourage the candidates to address issues such as:

- What information does the source provide?
- Does the source back up your knowledge?
- Who was the author/maker?
- When was the source written?
- Why was it written?
- Is there any doubt over the author/maker? Is he/she trustworthy?

Look at each source on its merits and avoid mechanical phrases and comments.

## Primary Sources

These are original materials or documents, including (but not limited to) sacred texts, first interpretations, books and sermons, writing by religious officials, etc.

## Secondary Sources

These are materials that engage with and draw on primary sources through analysis, interpretation or summarising. They are created after the primary sources. Examples include (but are not limited to) documents such as published literature and review articles.
