INTRODUCTION

1.1  Aims

The Level 2 Award in Additional Core Cymraeg qualification supports learners to:
further develop their skills to listen, view and read a variety of texts and media,
•
understanding and interpreting their meaning and messages

•  extend their knowledge and understanding of the vocabulary, grammar and

structure of Cymraeg

•  use Cymraeg authentically and correctly in a variety of situations and contexts,

communicate clearly and express views and opinions in an appropriate manner

•  strengthen their awareness and experience of everyday use of Cymraeg

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales’ Approval Criteria.

1.2  Curriculum for Wales

This Level 2 qualification in Additional Core Cymraeg is underpinned by the
Curriculum for Wales framework. It was designed to ensure that learners can
continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this
qualification. Central to this design are the principles of progression, along with the
statements of what matters and those subject specific skills and concepts outlined in
the 'Designing your curriculum’ section of the Languages, Literacy and
Communication Area of Learning and Experience.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to
embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral and
cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple mapping, and
information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for
integrating the learning experiences noted on page 15; the Guidance for Teaching
will include further information on integrating these learning experiences.

LEVEL 2 AWARD IN ADDITIONAL CORE CYMRAEG 8

The Level 2 Award in Additional Core Cymraeg qualification will support the
Curriculum for Wales by:
•  supporting the principles of progression1 by giving learners the opportunity to:

•  build on their linguistic skills
•  grow holistically in their understanding and purposeful use of languages,

literacy and communication

•  develop their linguistic repertoire through understanding how their own

languages work

•  adapt and manipulate language to communicate effectively to a range of

different audiences

•  develop interpretive and expressive language skills
•

transfer existing knowledge and skills into new contexts including the social
and cultural aspects of language.

•  supporting the key considerations for language development2 by giving learners

the opportunity to:
•  develop phonological awareness and phonemic awareness
•  build on learners’ previous knowledge of language(s) to support the learning

of Welsh

•  hear, view and read rich and varied Welsh
•  provide suitable and sufficient opportunities for learners to use their Welsh

purposefully in an authentic context.

•  supporting the statements of what matters for Languages, Literacy and

Communication3 by giving learners opportunities to:
•  develop their understanding, their empathy and their ability to respond and to

•

mediate effectively
interact, explore ideas, express viewpoints, knowledge and understanding
and build relationships

•  experience and respond to a variety of diverse literature that gives them

insight into the culture, people and history of Wales as well as the wider world

•  spark their imagination and creativity.

The construct of the Level 2 Award in Additional Core Cymraeg qualification is based
on the Welsh Government subject specific considerations4 and statements of what
matters for Languages, Literacy and Communication5:
•  understanding the world around us
•  enjoyment of Cymraeg and seeing value for Cymraeg outside the classroom
•  using language associated with interests
•  developing the use of Cymraeg for socialising and the workplace
•  a wide variety of opportunities for learners to hear, see and read material which is

rich and diverse in Cymraeg

•  develop linguistic skills in order to use Cymraeg in a confident manner.

1.3  Prior learning and progression

LEVEL 2 AWARD IN ADDITIONAL CORE CYMRAEG 9

The qualification was designed for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 in
English-medium settings who are progressing well in their study of GCSE Core
Cymraeg and are ready to progress further along the Cymraeg continuum. It
therefore builds on the conceptual understanding that learners have developed
through their learning from ages 3-14 and by studying GCSE Core Cymraeg.
Learners who have undertaken a Welsh (first language) programme of study up to
the end of year 9 cannot be entered for this qualification. Only learners who have
achieved GCSE Core Cymraeg or are entered for GCSE Core Cymraeg can take this
qualification.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills
and understanding in relation to the Welsh language which supports progression to
post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work.

1.4  Guided Learning Hours

The Level 2 Additional Core Cymraeg qualification has been designed to be
delivered within 40-60 guided learning hours. The units have been designed to be
delivered within 20-30 guided learning hours.

1.5  Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our
language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect
and accuracy. Language used should be as specific as possible. Staying informed
and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity.
Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further
amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC
will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the
specification will always be on the website.

1.6  Equality and fair access

LEVEL 2 AWARD IN ADDITIONAL CORE CYMRAEG 10

This specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic,
religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible,
features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access
and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual
orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to
enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills
without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the
following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access
Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This
document is available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of
provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete
barrier to any part of the assessment.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

5.1  Entries and Awards

Only learners who have achieved GCSE Core Cymraeg or are entered for GCSE
Core Cymraeg can take this qualification.

This is a unitised qualification. Learners are entered for each unit separately.

Unit 1 will be available in January and June 2027 (and each year thereafter). Unit 2
will be available in June 2027 (and each year thereafter) and the qualification will be
awarded for the first time in summer 2027.

Pre-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or under on 31st August in the
academic year in which they were entered)

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score
from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the
third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s).
This is referred to as a 'fresh start'. When retaking a qualification (fresh start), a
candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from the
exam unit, which is unit 1, taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating
the new grade(s).

Marks for the non-examination assessment, which is unit 2, may be used for the life
of the specification.

If a candidate has been entered for a unit, but is absent for that unit, the absence
does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit
candidate in the final resit series.

Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1st September in the
academic year in which they are entered)

There is no limit on the number of times a candidate can resit an individual unit;
however, the better uniform mark score from the most two recent attempts will be
used in calculating the final overall.

The ‘fresh start’ rule does not apply to post-16 candidates.

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not
count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in
the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment, which is unit 2,  may be used for the life of
the specification.
