## GCSE SPANISH

## <span id="page-5-0"></span>1 INTRODUCTION

## <span id="page-5-1"></span>1.1 Aims

The GCSE Spanish qualification must support learners to:

- understand the language by developing reading, listening and watching skills
- communicate clearly, accurately and creatively by developing speaking and writing skills
- demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the vocabulary, grammar and structures of Spanish
- express themselves in a range of contexts and for different audiences and purposes
- contribute to conversations and discussions
- demonstrate their awareness of the culture and society of the countries and communities where the language is spoken and make connections with their own languages and culture.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales' Approval Criteria.

## <span id="page-5-2"></span>1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Spanish qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/languages-literacy-and-communication/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of what](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/languages-literacy-and-communication/statements-of-what-matters/)  [matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/languages-literacy-and-communication/statements-of-what-matters/) and those [subject specific skills and concepts](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/languages-literacy-and-communication/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area) outlined in the ['Designing your](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/languages-literacy-and-communication/designing-your-curriculum/)  [Curriculum'](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/languages-literacy-and-communication/designing-your-curriculum/) section of the Languages, Literacy and Communication Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix C provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted on p.18 ; the Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

The GCSE Spanish qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:

- supporting the statements of what matters[1](#page-5-3) , giving learners the opportunity to:
  - ensure that knowledge and skills in one language are transferred to and developed in other languages
  - develop their understanding, empathy and their ability to respond and to mediate effectively
  - use languages in order to be effective as they interact, explore ideas, express viewpoints, knowledge and understanding
  - provide them with literary experiences that can engage them as listeners, viewers, readers, narrators and creators.

<span id="page-5-3"></span><sup>©</sup> WJEC CBAC Ltd 2024. <sup>1</sup> [Languages, Literacy and Communication: Statements of what matters -](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/languages-literacy-and-communication/statements-of-what-matters/) Hwb (gov.wales)

{7}------------------------------------------------

- supporting the principles of progression[2](#page-6-0) by giving learners the opportunity to:
  - build on their linguistic skills
  - grow holistically in their understanding and purposeful use of languages, literacy and communication
  - develop their linguistic repertoire through understanding how their own languages work
  - adapt and manipulate language to communicate effectively to a range of different audiences
  - develop receptive, interpretive and expressive language skills
  - transfer existing knowledge and skills into new contexts including the social and cultural aspects of language.
- supporting the key considerations for language development[3](#page-6-1) by giving learners the opportunity to:
  - develop phonological awareness and phonemic awareness
  - continue to progress in all their languages from their different starting points.

The GCSE Spanish qualification will also be based on the following:

- understanding and responding to spoken and written language
- identifying messages and drawing conclusions
- using knowledge of grammar
- translating from the language of study
- communicating clearly and effectively in speaking and in writing
- an everyday <sup>4</sup> [la](#page-6-2)nguage list
- a core vocabulary list based on high frequency and high utility vocabulary[5](#page-6-3)
- using accurate pronunciation and intonation
- using knowledge of cultural and regional familiarity.

All units will be based on the following broad themes:

- **language for leisure and wellbeing**
- **language for travel**
- **language for study and work.**

The vocabulary in this specification is transferable across the three broad themes. It will allow teachers to deliver the vocabulary through their own engaging and motivating topics, using language in a natural and reoccurring way. For example, teachers may wish to include the topics of identity and culture, family, friends and relationships, and free time for the language for leisure and wellbeing theme; travel, places in town, environment and sustainability for the language for travel theme; future plans, higher education and the world of work for the language of work and study theme. These examples are neither prescriptive nor exhaustive.

<span id="page-6-1"></span><sup>3</sup> [Languages, Literacy and Communication: Designing your curriculum -](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/languages-literacy-and-communication/designing-your-curriculum/) Hwb (gov.wales)

<span id="page-6-2"></span><sup>4</sup> The role and purpose of the everyday language list is to provide teachers and learners with a useful reference of what to cover pre-GCSE.

<span id="page-6-3"></span><sup>5</sup> The core vocabulary list is made up of items which are frequently used in Spanish as well as being useful for today's 14-16 language learners.

{8}------------------------------------------------

### <span id="page-7-0"></span>1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work.

The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of Spanish at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

## <span id="page-7-1"></span>1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE Spanish has been designed to be delivered within 120 – 140 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

## <span id="page-7-2"></span>1.5 Use of language

<span id="page-7-3"></span>As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

{9}------------------------------------------------

### 1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website [\(www.jcq.org.uk\).](http://www.jcq.org.uk/)

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

{10}------------------------------------------------

## <span id="page-9-0"></span>2 SUBJECT CONTENT

#### Learners will need to:

- learn and use the grammar list and Spanish sound-spelling correspondences in Appendix A
- learn and use the everyday language and core vocabulary lists in Appendix B.

Assessment materials will only use the aspects of grammar outlined in Appendix A; unless indicated in the right-hand column as receptive grammar only, learners will be required to demonstrate both receptive and productive knowledge of the grammar from the list.

Assessment materials for all units will **only** use vocabulary from the list in Appendix B.

{15}------------------------------------------------

#### **Areas of content**

#### **Unit 2 Reading and Writing**

In this unit, learners will gain the knowledge, skills and understanding required to respond to written Spanish.

Learners will study a work in Spanish in one of the following genres: graphic novel, short story, film script, novel.

Centres will have the freedom to choose their own works and different learners may choose to study different works. Regardless of the work chosen, the purpose of this unit is for learners to engage with a Spanish work and write about it in Spanish. It is likely that some works will contain words that are outside of the vocabulary lists; in this case teachers will need to ensure that learners understand the general message, learners are not expected to understand every word, the purpose is to be able to write about the work they have studied.

WJEC will provide example works for each genre in Spanish.

For written production in Spanish, the expected language will be from the specified content (the grammar and sound-spelling correspondence in **Appendix A,** and the vocabulary in **Appendix B**).

Equal credit will be given for language used that is beyond the defined content but that fulfils the task requirements.

Tasks will be set by WJEC. The assessment will be carried out by teachers at the centre, audio recorded and marked by external examiners.

The assessment will consist of three tasks: a read aloud and role play, a presentation and discussion, and a conversation.

There will be a teacher booklet that will provide instructions and guidance as to how to conduct the assessment, and WJEC will provide detail as to the read aloud and role-play card to be allocated to each learner in the Assessment Pack. Centres are required to ensure that each candidate uses the correct allocated card.

The speaking assessments will take place during a five-week period between April and May, specified annually by WJEC. Centres may open the packs up to three working days in advance of the first timetabled assessment. The preparation period for the presentation may begin two weeks prior to the first timetabled assessment.

#### **Unit 2 – Reading and Writing**

The assessment lasts for 1 hour 15% of qualification 45 marks

Learners are not permitted to use dictionaries in any part of the assessment, or any other reference materials.

The task will be released to centres each year in March prior to the summer series in which the NEA must be submitted. The assessment will be marked by external examiners.

The assessment will take place during an eight-week period between March and May, specified annually by WJEC. Centres may download the task three working days in advance of the first assessment.

The Assessment Pack will be updated and released annually and will include an updated role play card allocation table along with the specific period in which the speaking assessments, and Unit 2 must take place.

## <span id="page-22-0"></span>4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for GCSE Spanish.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our [Guide to preventing, reporting and](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)  [investigating malpractice.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC (malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

<span id="page-22-1"></span>In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet [Suspected](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)  [Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)

## 5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

## <span id="page-23-0"></span>5.1 Making entries

This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the course.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series until the end of the life of this specification. Summer 2027 will be the first assessment opportunity.

A qualification may be taken more than once. Candidates must resit all examination units in the same series.

Marks for non-examination assessment (NEA) may be carried forward for the life of the specification. If a candidate resits an NEA unit (rather than carrying forward the previous NEA mark), it is the new mark that will count towards the overall grade, even if it is lower than a previous attempt (unless the mark is absent).

The entry code appears below.

#### <span id="page-28-0"></span>Spanish sound-spelling correspondences

Learners will be expected to know the Spanish alphabet and will need to know the soundspelling correspondences listed below. The list specifies key differences in sound-spelling correspondences between Spanish and Cymraeg/English which learners will need to learn at GCSE to be able to read out loud with sufficient accuracy at this level. It is not an exhaustive list of all the sound-spelling correspondences in the Spanish language.

It is recognised that most learners will be familiar with the above European Spanish sound symbols, however, should a learner demonstrate pronunciation from another standard form of Spanish, this will be accepted.

As language is ever changing, the Real Academia Española could accept the new use of a more gender neutral and inclusive language. WJEC will not make changes to this specification but will be accepting of any changes brought about in the future. As a starting point gender identification should not be an issue as learners should be using first-person pronouns or using masculine/feminine nouns. If learners choose to speak in the third-person, they must be consistent in their pronoun choices, for example, use of 'they/them/xe/xhe' should not be seen as grammatically incorrect if the candidate is consistently using the chosen pronoun throughout their speaking. Please be mindful of learners' choices in assessing all work. When discussing another individual in the third person where gender or gender preference is unknown or undisclosed, WJEC expects consistent application of the gender agreement of the learner's choice.
