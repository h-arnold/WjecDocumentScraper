Aims of the Delivery Guide

The aim of the Delivery Guide is to give an overview of the qualification and to help teachers
understand how we assess the GCSE. It will offer an introduction to the specification, an
assessment overview, and will support teachers in better understanding how to prepare their
learners for the assessment of the different units. More information on each unit can be
found in the separate unit guides.

As this is an international languages qualification, it carries over many other similarities to
GCSE French and GCSE German.  As such, ideas that could be incorporated into teaching
and learning, can be found in the Guidance for Teaching documents for these qualifications,
and we encourage teachers to research these documents for further guidance.

Themes and the Use of Language

The following diagram shows example topics that could be used within all of the three broad
themes.

It is important for teachers to ensure that all topics and associated vocabulary are
transferable across all three themes and should not be used solely in one theme. The
examples given are neither prescriptive, nor exhaustive and teachers can and should,
deliver the vocabulary through their own engaging and motivating topics, using language in a
natural and reoccurring way.

Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:
•  Specification – this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to

know by the end of their course.

•  Assessment Pack – this contains the Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) including
sample exam papers and sample NEA tasks, relevant controls for the NEA and mark
schemes

This guide builds upon the information in the specification and assessment pack to help
further your understanding of said documents.

Understanding the specification amplification

Learners should be made aware of:

Read the text about university in Spain and answer the questions in English.

Según el Ministerio de Universidades, hay 1 722 247 estudiantes en España. Y el
próximo mes de junio tendrá lugar el tradicional examen de entrada a la universidad.

Miles de estudiantes de todas las comunidades de España realizarán una prueba con
el objetivo de poder empezar una formación universitaria. Las instituciones de España
se reconocen por su alta calidad.

A pesar de que el precio de la universidad española es mucho más bajo que el de
otros países, la formación no es gratis.

El precio de la universidad española cambia entre las distintas comunidades y
regiones. Además, tampoco es el mismo entre una carrera y otra.

Así, la universidad puede costar entre los 680 y los 1 280 euros cada año? Sin
embargo, en el caso de elegir una universidad privada, los precios pueden
aumentar hasta los 18 000 euros.

alcohol, para permitir la venta solo a los mayores de 18 años. Además, la policía controla más
de 40 parques, jardines y otros espacios donde normalmente se encuentra a los jóvenes,
para parar el consumo de alcohol en los espacios públicos. La tercera es hablar con los
dueños sobre las reglas de la venta del alcohol y las consecuencias de no seguirlas.

bares, que bajen el volumen de la música y que respeten a los horarios.
