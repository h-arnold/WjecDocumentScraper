# <span id="page-3-0"></span>Aims of the Delivery Guide

The aim of the Delivery Guide is to give an overview of the qualification and to help teachers understand how we assess the GCSE. It will offer an introduction to the specification, an assessment overview, and will support teachers in better understanding how to prepare their learners for the assessment of the different units. More information on each unit can be found in the separate unit guides.

As this is an international languages qualification, it carries over many other similarities to GCSE French and GCSE German. As such, ideas that could be incorporated into teaching and learning, can be found in the Guidance for Teaching documents for these qualifications, and we encourage teachers to research these documents for further guidance.

# <span id="page-3-1"></span>Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE Spanish consists of 4 units:

|        | Unit title          | Type of Assessment         | Weighting |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------------|-----------|
| Unit 1 | Oracy               | Non-examination assessment | 30%       |
| Unit 2 | Reading and Writing | Non-examination assessment | 15%       |
| Unit 3 | Listening           | Written examination        | 20%       |
| Unit 4 | Reading and Writing | Written examination        | 35%       |

This is a linear qualification. This qualification is not tiered.

All units are compulsory.

### Themes and the Use of Language

The following diagram shows example topics that could be used within all of the three broad themes.

It is important for teachers to ensure that all topics and associated vocabulary are transferable across all three themes and should not be used solely in one theme. The examples given are neither prescriptive, nor exhaustive and teachers can and should, deliver the vocabulary through their own engaging and motivating topics, using language in a natural and reoccurring way.

![](_page_5_Figure_14.jpeg)

Non-examination assessments (NEA) must be conducted under controlled conditions as outlined below, and in accordance with regulatory requirements. The NEA must be taken in the final year of the course.

Learners are not permitted to use dictionaries in any part of the assessment, or any other reference materials excluding the learner's own notes.

Tasks will be set by WJEC. The assessment will be carried out by teachers at the centre, audio recorded and marked by external examiners.

The assessment will consist of three tasks: a read aloud and role play, a presentation and discussion, and a conversation.

{6}------------------------------------------------

There will be a teacher booklet that will provide instructions and guidance as to how to conduct the assessment, and WJEC will provide detail as to the read aloud and role-play card to be allocated to each learner in the Assessment Pack. Centres are required to ensure that each candidate uses the correct allocated card.

The speaking assessments will take place during a five-week period between April and May, specified annually by WJEC. Centres may open the packs up to three working days in advance of the first timetabled assessment. The preparation period for the presentation may begin two weeks prior to the first timetabled assessment.

{12}------------------------------------------------

# <span id="page-12-0"></span>Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:

- Specification this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to know by the end of their course.
- Assessment Pack this contains the Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) including sample exam papers and sample NEA tasks, relevant controls for the NEA and mark schemes

This guide builds upon the information in the specification and assessment pack to help further your understanding of said documents.

# <span id="page-12-1"></span>Understanding the specification amplification

Learners should be made aware of:

- the specification stems
- what the specification stems mean.

## <span id="page-12-2"></span>Specification Stem

When you look through the specification you will notice in the amplification column, we use the following wording before the list of content learners need to know; we call this a stem:

# **Amplification Specification Stem** Learners should: • **Be able to** develop their listening skills to understand and respond to different types of spoken language in a range of different contexts.

| Specification Stem | When it is used |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Learners should be able to | When learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques. |

{13}------------------------------------------------

## <span id="page-13-0"></span>Command words

Learners should be made aware of:

- what command words are
- what each command word means
- what each command word assesses.

Command words are the words and phrases used in assessments that tell learners how they should answer the question or complete the task. Command words direct the learner through the question or task and indicate the nature of the response required.

![](_page_13_Figure_7.jpeg)

The following tables are not exhaustive, but will give you a good idea of the command words we typically use:

# <span id="page-16-0"></span>Mark Schemes

Mark schemes and/or assessment criteria test the intended learning outcomes for a component. They describe the knowledge and skills (and possibly attitude) that a candidate is expected to demonstrate in their responses and they are then used in marking the work.

### **Objective based mark scheme:**

For very short answer questions requiring one correct response.

| Question |  | Answer |  |  |  | AO1 | AO2 | AO3 | Total Mark |

| 3. |  | Read the text about university in Spain and answer the questions in English. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | Según el Ministerio de Universidades, hay 1 722 247 estudiantes en España. Y el próximo mes de junio tendrá lugar el tradicional examen de entrada a la universidad. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Miles de estudiantes de todas las comunidades de España realizarán una prueba con el objetivo de poder empezar una formación universitaria. Las instituciones de España se reconocen por su alta calidad. A pesar de que el precio de la universidad española es mucho más bajo que el de otros países, la formación no es gratis. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                        |      |        |                  |     |     |               |
|  |  | El precio de la universidad española cambia entre las distintas comunidades y regiones. Además, tampoco es el mismo entre una carrera y otra. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Así, la universidad puede costar entre los 680 y los 1 280 euros cada año? Sin embargo, en el caso de elegir una universidad privada, los precios pueden aumentar hasta los 18 000 euros. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Además, la policía controla más de 40 parques, jardines y otros espacios donde normalmente se encuentra a los jóvenes, para parar el consumo de alcohol en los espacios públicos. La tercera es hablar con los dueños sobre las reglas de la venta del alcohol y las consecuencias de no seguirlas. La policía recomienda a los jóvenes que no levanten la voz en el exterior de las tiendas y bares, que bajen el volumen de la música y que respeten a los horarios. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
