Assessment details

Written examination: 1 hour 30 mins
Set and marked by WJEC
35% of qualification
70 marks

This unit requires learners to respond to a range of questions with fixed responses and
responses in Cymraeg/English, to translate short extracts from the assessed language
into Cymraeg/English and to respond in the assessed language to a choice of written
tasks.

The unit is divided into 2 sections – Section A and Section B. Each section will cover all
broad themes.

In Section A, a reading task will provide the stimulus for the translation task. Translation in
this context means a sufficient and appropriate rendering of the meaning of the original
language.

Texts will only use the grammar and vocabulary specified in this specification. Words
outside of the specification grammar and vocabulary lists will be glossed. For written
production, the expected language will be from the specified content (vocabulary and
grammar), with equal credit given for language used that is beyond the defined content
but that fulfils the task requirements.

The Rubrics will be in Cymraeg/English.
Stimuli will be in the assessed language.
All responses will be non-verbal and in Cymraeg/English, apart from the response in
Section B to the extended writing task.

Learners are not permitted to use a dictionary in any part of the assessment.

Section A: four comprehension questions and translation (AO2 – 30 marks)

Learners will read a range of texts linked to each of the broad themes:
•
•

texts based on practical transactional language such as information notices and signs
factual texts such as an e-mail, poster, web page, letter, newspaper article, flyer,
graph or advert

•  prose such as continuous literary texts, extracts from short stories and magazine

articles.

Learners will demonstrate understanding of the texts by responding to a range of
questions in Cymraeg/English. Question types will include: multiple choice questions,
true/false with justification, matching words/phrases with definitions/images, matching
statements with their source, short answers in Cymraeg/English, gap-fill, finish the
sentences and comprehension questions to demonstrate understanding.

Section B:
Question 6 (35 marks) (AO2 – 20 marks) (AO3 – 15 marks)

Learners will write an extended piece of writing in response to written prompts. There will
be a choice of three options in Cymraeg/English, one from each broad theme. Learners
will respond to the question prompts writing up to a maximum of 120 words in the
assessed language.

Teacher Guidance

Learners should be able to:
•  understand and respond to different types
of written language in a range of contexts
•  understand and respond to different types
of language written for different purposes
and audience
identify the overall message, key points
and opinions in spoken and written
passages, some involving more complex
language, and draw conclusions where
appropriate

•

•  use knowledge of grammar to support

understanding, including recognising the
relationship between past, present and
future events
translate short and simple texts from
Spanish to Cymraeg/English

•

•  communicate clearly and effectively in

writing for a variety of purposes, including
communicating information, describing,
narrating, expressing and justifying
opinions

•  communicate meaning in writing in a
range of formal and informal contexts

•  use knowledge of vocabulary and

grammar to communicate meaningfully,
using more complex structures which

Choose texts that are both fiction and non-fiction. Teachers will need to adapt the texts
they find to ensure that the words are on the grammar or vocabulary lists.
Use websites such as:
•  https://elpais.com/
•  https://www.bbc.com/mundo
•  https://www.elviajedetuvida.es/

Use travel websites for local areas/countries.

You can also use creation tools such as Canva to create images which include text.
Provide reading activities that develop both close reading and skimming and scanning.
Match-up activities: Learners can match-up key words in Cymraeg/English with words in
the text. This will develop their skimming and scanning skills.

They can then fill in gaps such as:

•  The customer wants to drink _______.
•  There are _______ people living in Madrid.

Teachers could ask learners to find the synonym/antonym such as a synonym for
Quisiera.

Treasure hunt: give learners sentences in Cymraeg/ English and have the Spanish
translation around the room. Ask learners to go around the room and find the correct
translation. Add extra challenge by asking them to remember the sentence rather than
bring the Cymraeg/English around the room too.

reference past, present and future events
where appropriate.

 GCSE Spanish Unit 4 Guidance for Teaching  7

Develop narrow reading skills by providing learners with three or four texts that are very
similar, apart from a few details. For example, include three paragraphs about young
people at school. Teachers can then ask questions such as:
•  Who likes Maths and English?
•  Who has lunch at 1.15pm?

Choose texts that include a range of tenses. Teachers should gradually build up the
complexity of the language throughout the text. For example, start with several
sentences in the present tense and then include sentences in the future tense including
some more complex vocabulary such as Iré a Venezuela para mejorar el español ya que
quiero estudiar los idiomas en la universidad.

Provide learners with sentences in Spanish and their Cymraeg/ English equivalent.
However, include mistranslations in Cymraeg/ English. Ask learners to fix the translations
so that they are correct.

Provide learners with gap-fill activities, however include more possible answers than
gaps. These tasks can be used to focus on a particular grammatical element such as the
agreement of adjectives.

Provide learners with three or four slightly different texts and ask them to spot the
difference:

Use the texts as model examples for learners’ own writing. Learners should use the texts
to develop a bank of vocabulary.

Create tasks that challenge learners to improve the quality of their writing:

Develop writing tasks of 120 words. These tasks should focus on one of the three broad
themes. Include one bullet point in each of the tenses: past, present and future.

Encourage learners to give opinions and justify them.

Teachers may wish to use acronyms such as SDORFP to encourage learners to extend
their language:
•  S= statement
•  D= development
•  O= opinion
•  R= reason
•  F= future
•  P= past

SDORFP: ¿Cuáles deportes practicas?

Juego al tenis al polideportivo. Me chifla jugar al tenis puesto me relaja. El año que viene
jugaré al tenis de mesa ya que opino que es interesante. Sin embargo cuando yo era
pequeño no jugaba al tenis ni al tenis de mesa porque era muy perezoso.

 GCSE Spanish Unit 4 Guidance for Teaching  9

Use challenge grids to encourage learners to develop their written language:

Teachers may wish to start by using writing frames to support learners as they develop
their writing. Additionally, keyword mats or aids can encourage learners to develop the
complexity of their language. As the course progresses, they should have opportunities
to write without the support of these aids.

Provide learners with a simple sentence such as estudio inglés and ask them to improve
it.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd 2025.

 GCSE Spanish Unit 4 Guidance for Teaching  10

Provide learners with opportunities to read different texts such as travel blogs, magazine
articles, news articles, fact files, posters, emails and infographics (ensure the words are
on the WJEC vocabulary or grammar lists or include a glossary):
•  Use paragraphs or pages from books that have been translated into Spanish such as

Heartstopper, Harry Potter etc.

•  Use the websites mentioned throughout this teachers’ guide to find authentic texts.
•  Find images of menus, tourist flyers or create them using tools such as Canva.
•  Use Twitter to follow governments from different countries. Encourage learners to

also do this to develop their reading and translation skills.

Highlight key sentences or phrases in the text and ask pupils to translate them from
Spanish to Cymraeg/ English. These should become increasingly more challenging.

Translation activities: provide learners with several sentences to translate into
Cymraeg/English and then into Spanish:

1.  Detesto la música de Andalucía porque es lenta.
2.  Prefiero la música de Galicia porque me gustan los instrumentos.
3.  Me gusta mucho la música de Galicia porque me gusta mucho el ritmo.
4.  I hate the music from the Basque country because it is boring.
5.  I love the music from Valencia because it is fast.

Then challenge learners to create their own sentences.

Include ‘tangled translations’ (Gianfranco Conti, PhD. Co-author of 'The Language
Teacher toolkit'). This involves having a text in the middle that is a mix of Spanish and
Cymraeg/English. On one side learners have to fully translate the text into Spanish and
on the other side they must fully translate the text into Cymraeg/English.

Learners will be required to read a range of
texts linked to each of the broad themes
including:
•

texts based on practical transactional
language such as information notices and
signs
factual texts such as an e-mail, poster,
web page, letter, newspaper article, flyer,
graph, advert

•

•  prose such as continuous literary texts,
extracts from short stories, magazine
articles.

Learners will be required to:
•  demonstrate understanding of the texts by
responding to a range of questions in
Cymraeg/English
translate sentences into Cymraeg/English
within a context

•

•  write in Spanish in response to a stimulus.

 GCSE Spanish Unit 4 Guidance for Teaching  11

Use “retrieval practice” activities for translation practice:

Create a reading activity based on one of the three themes and use it as a springboard
for a writing activity. For example, read a text about young people at school in Spain.
Learners can then use this to write a response to a Spanish pen pal explaining what
school is like in the UK, what their primary school was like and what they plan to do next
year.

Learning Experiences

Learners should be encouraged to consider the following learning experiences and skills to
further develop their understanding, appreciation and awareness of the subject content.
Information in the table below provides opportunities for teachers to integrate the learning
experiences into delivery.

Learning Experience

Exemplification of Learning Experience

learn about the culture and
society in the countries and
communities where the
international language is
spoken

explore the cross-cutting
themes of human rights and
diversity, including Black,
Asian and minority ethnic
perspectives, identity, culture
and contributions

Learners will read different types of texts from across the
Spanish-speaking world. These texts will cover the three
themes and will allow learners to compare life in Wales with life
in different countries.

Centres may wish to ensure that they choose texts from
different Spanish-speaking countries to ensure learners
engage with a broad range of cultures and communities,

Texts will include people from a diverse range of backgrounds
including Black, Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds.

When looking at Spanish words from across the Spanish-
speaking community, centres can highlight words that have
been taken from indigenous communities. For example, the
word ‘chocolate’ comes from the word ‘xocolātl’. This also
leads to interesting discussions around colonisation and the
importance of chocolate in different cultures.

have direct or indirect contact
with speakers of the language

Centres and learners will be able to use initiatives such as MFL
Mentoring – Modern Foreign Languages and Llwybrau at
Ieithoedd Cymru Routes into Languages Cymru.

Both schemes support international languages and
multilingualism in the new curriculum for Wales. Centres can
request visits from Mentors and Student Language
Ambassadors and sessions can be in person or online.

Centres can also apply for funding via Taith - Hwb (gov.wales)
to take part in educational international exchanges.

Learners will have contact with speakers of the language
through reading authentic texts.

Learners may also benefit from hearing text read aloud as this
will help them to identify cognates.

Learners may engage with Spanish-speakers through pen pal
programmes.

 GCSE Spanish Unit 4 Guidance for Teaching  13

Learners will have the opportunity to engage with the language
from a variety of sources and in a variety of genres and media
throughout the specification.

Texts will come from a wide variety of sources: fiction and non-
fiction.

Learners will also write for different purposes such as a blog or
a letter.

Learners will have the opportunity to demonstrate language
strategies and language learning skills, including the use of
dictionaries throughout the specification.

Learners will need to use a range of reading strategies to
identify key information in the texts that they read. They will
also need to use previous knowledge, cognates, dictionaries
and context to understand what they read.

Learners will identify patterns in what they read to develop their
grammatical understanding.

Learners will use context, previous knowledge and cognates to
translate into Cymraeg/English. They will also use a common-
sense approach as to what makes sense in Cymraeg/English.

Learners will use what they read to develop their knowledge of
vocabulary and grammar. They will then use this to improve the
quality of their own written work.

translanguaging

Learners will have the opportunity to use their translanguaging
skills throughout the specification.

Learners will be expected to translate from Spanish into
Cymraeg/English.

Learners will read in Spanish but will be asked to respond in
Cymraeg/English.

making appropriate
connections with other parts
of the curriculum to develop
and deepen learners’ bilingual
and multilingual skills

Learners will be encouraged to make connections with other
parts of the curriculum throughout their learning of Spanish with
cross-curricular connections to humanities subjects and of
course with the other languages within the LLC Area of
Learning Experience.

Learners will be expected to read and translate from texts
which cover the three themes.

Learners will need to write 120 words on one of the three
themes.

Across the three themes there are opportunities to engage with
different areas of the curriculum. For example, learners may
read about different important religious festivals celebrated
across the Spanish-speaking world. They may also read about
different sports and ways to keep physically and mentally
healthy.

Opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales

Curriculum for Wales Strands

Cross-cutting Themes

 GCSE Spanish Unit 4 Guidance for Teaching  15

There are many opportunities to include Local, National & International Contexts and
Sustainability in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because
they will be engaging with texts from the Spanish-speaking world. They will then use
these texts as a springboard to write about themselves.

Below are some examples of how Local, National & International Contexts and
Sustainability can be embedded into teaching and learning:

Example

•  When choosing texts try to ensure they come from different Spanish-speaking countries.

Consider how the texts develop learners’ cultural understanding. For example, choose a text
that talks about typical Christmas dishes across the Spanish-speaking world. Learners can
identify the main dishes and say which ones they would like to try. They could then compare
this with traditional British and Welsh food. They could also consider the reasons why food is
different across the world.

•  Provide learners with two texts side by side, one about Wales and one about a Spanish-
speaking country. For example, include a travel blog about Ystradfellte and one about
Iguazú. Then create a chart where learners note key facts about the two waterfalls such as
height, depth, number of visitors, etc.

Local, National & International
Contexts, and Sustainability

 GCSE Spanish Unit 4 Guidance for Teaching  16

There are many opportunities to include Sustainability in GCSE Spanish. These
opportunities are important to Learners because they will read about how different places
are developing a sustainable approach.

Below are some examples of how Sustainability can be embedded into teaching and
learning:

Example

•  Find texts that describe how Spanish-speaking countries are looking after the environment.

Sustainability

Centres may want to look at the following websites:
https://www.reddearboles.org
https://www.fundaciondelatierra.org

•  When learners read and write about technology, encourage them to consider the positives

and negatives in terms of the environmental impact.

•  Look at a text that discusses the fast fashion industry in Spain. This would also be a great

opportunity to practise numbers as learners could identify the numbers of clothes produced
each year, on average how many times the clothes are worn and how many kg ends up
going straight to landfill.

There are many opportunities to include Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE)  in
GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they will read and
write about different types of relationships.

Below are some examples of how RSE can be embedded into teaching and learning:

Example

•

Include reading activities that present a diverse range of relationships: both platonic and
romantic. When creating reading activities ensure there are different family dynamics for
example, a child with two mums, a child with stepsiblings or a child with a transgender friend.

•  During LGBTQ+ History Month and Pride discuss the history and lived experiences of

LGBTQ+ people across the Spanish-speaking world.

Relationships and Sexuality
Education

 GCSE Spanish Unit 4 Guidance for Teaching  17

•  Compare the rights of women in different Spanish-speaking countries and within different

communities. This website provides information on inspirational Latin American women:
https://latino.si.edu/25-latinas-you-should-know. Learners could research one and explain
why she inspires them.

There are many opportunities to include Human Rights Education and Diversity in GCSE
Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they will read about
people with a wide range of lived experiences.

Below are some examples of how Human Rights Education and Diversity can be
embedded into teaching and learning:

Example

•

Include texts from different Spanish-speaking parts of the world. For example, include a text
that looks at The Dominican Republic and its history and slavery. Teachers may also wish to
look at how the indigenous people were treated when Christopher Columbus arrived and the
impact of colonisation. Identify slave owners who were British or consider the similarities
between British and Spanish colonisation.

•  Look at how young people in Central America are being forced into gangs and consider how

this contravenes their rights. This then links into why people become refugees.

•  When looking at food, look at the fact that different autonomous communities in Spain have
different traditional dishes. This highlights the diverse makeup of the country. You could do
something similar with Mexico.

•

Include Latin X role models such as Frida Kahlo, Annie Segarra, Jennicet Gutiérrez , Julio
Salgado and Stephanie Beatriz.

 GCSE Spanish Unit 4 Guidance for Teaching  18

There are many opportunities to include Career and Work-Related Experiences (CWRE) in
GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they will read and
write about their future plans. They will also need to challenge themselves to use more
complex language.

Below are some examples of how CWRE can be embedded into teaching and
learning:

Example

•  Provide texts that discuss what school is like in Spanish-speaking countries. Similarly,
find texts that talk about work and unemployment in Spanish-speaking countries.

•  Learners can use these texts as a springboard to discuss what school is like in Wales

and what they would like to do in the future.

•  Discuss with learners the benefit of learning another language. Teachers may wish to

look at Routes into Languages for supporting resources:
https://routesintolanguagescymru.co.uk/.

•  Consider encouraging learners to become Language Ambassadors. In this role they
could teach younger learners about Spanish or support events for European Day of
Languages.

•  Encourage learners to experiment with their language and remind them that at GCSE
we do not expect perfection. Create activities where learners have to write about a
specific topic such as healthy eating. Include a point system: 1 point = present tense, 2
points = past or future tense, 4 points = idiomatic expression or exclamation, 5 points =
si fuera sentence, etc.

Careers and Work-Related
Experiences

 GCSE Spanish Unit 4 Guidance for Teaching  19

Cross-curricular Skills – Literacy

Reading

There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities
are important to Learners because it will enable them to develop their reading and writing
in Spanish.

Below are some examples of how Literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning:

Example

•  Learners should read texts of varying length. Teachers may wish to include images with text
on them or written pieces of text. Texts can be both non-fiction and fiction. When creating
reading questions, start with a simple question and leave the most challenging questions for
the last few. This will allow all learners to access some parts of the text which is essential as
there is no tiering. The first questions may be a match-up activity whereas your last question
may require learners to write in full sentences.

•  Whenever teachers carry out a reading task of 80 words or more, highlight four or five

sentences and ask learners to translate them into English.

•  Encourage learners to take ownership of their own learning by putting their mobile phones
into Spanish along with their social media (if they use it). They can create a bank of words
that they learn from this. Encourage learners to read “BBC Mundo” or something similar to
help develop their reading skills.

Example

Writing

•  Provide learners with plenty of opportunities to write 120 words on each of the three themes.

Encourage them to always use three tenses and to give opinions and reasons.

•  Use sentence builders or writing frames to support learners as they build up the complexity of

their written language.

 GCSE Spanish Unit 4 Guidance for Teaching  20

Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy

Understanding the number
system helps us to represent and
compare relationships between
numbers and quantities

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities
are important to Learners because they need to be able read numbers.

Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning:

Example

•  Create a version of “Race Across the World” for learners. Provide learners with a start and
end point. Then give them a budget. Learners could either carry out their own research or
provide them with information packs on routes, hotel and travel costs and opportunities for
work. Learners need to work out how quickly they can reach their destination whilst staying in
budget. This could then be a springboard into a writing activity.

•

Include texts that use percentages and big numbers. Encourage learners to highlight and
record these numbers for future reference.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd 2025.

Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competence

 GCSE Spanish Unit 4 Guidance for Teaching  21

Interacting and Collaborating

There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE Spanish. These
opportunities are important to Learners because they can read and write Spanish using
digital devices.

Below are some examples of how Digital Competence can be embedded into teaching and
learning:

Example

•  Learners can work on a shared document or presentation on a specific topic. For example,
they could create a presentation collaboratively which details how technology has changed
over the last 100 years. Some of the learners in the group could research the changes over
the last 100 years (this also links to reliable sources and citing information). Other learners in
the group could create a table of key vocabulary needed for the presentation. Learners can
then collaborate to create a presentation in Spanish on the key changes. Appoint someone in
the group or someone from another group to review the presentation and suggest any
improvements.

•

If each group was given a different task based on technology, these could then be used as
reading tasks for different groups of learners.

Example

Producing

•  The example above also links to producing. However, ask learners to justify why they
have included certain information and images in their presentation. It may be that
learners have a choice over what software they use for their presentations and so they
can justify their choices.

 GCSE Spanish Unit 4 Guidance for Teaching  22

Integral Skills

There are many opportunities to include Creativity and Innovation in GCSE Spanish.
These opportunities are important to Learners because they need to create their own
written pieces in Spanish.

Below are some examples of how Creativity and Innovation can be embedded into
teaching and learning:

Creativity and Innovation

Example

•  Creativity will be developed every time learners write something. Use a reading activity

as a springboard for a writing task.

•  For example, provide learners with a reading task about eco-tourism in Peru. They then
need to imagine they are setting up an eco-tourism holiday and say what they would
include.

There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE
Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they need to be language
detectives to develop their receptive skills.

Below are some examples of how Critical Thinking and Problem Solving can be
embedded into teaching and learning:

Example

•  Reading can be used to teach new vocabulary and grammatical patterns. For example, show
learners a text that includes regular -ar verbs in the preterite. Ask learners to identify these
verbs and see if they can create a rule. Teachers could then show learners a text that

There are many opportunities to include Planning and Organisation in GCSE Spanish.
These opportunities are important to Learners because they will need to plan how long to
spend on the reading, translation and writing tasks.

Below are some examples of how Planning and Organisation can be embedded into
teaching and learning:

Example

•  Provide learners with one reading activity and give them a set amount of time to

complete it. Then give them several reading activities in a set time frame. Discuss with
them how long they think they should spend on each task. Then give them the
opportunity to complete it. Review the task afterwards and discuss what they could do
differently next time.

•  Provide learners with bullet points on one of the three themes. Encourage learners to

highlight key words in the bullet points and use this to create a plan. Teachers may wish
to use acronyms such as:

•  AVOCADO ~ Adjectives Verbs Opinions Conjunctions Adverbs Description

Outstanding phrases.

•  SDORFP ~ Statement Development Opinion Reason Future Past.
