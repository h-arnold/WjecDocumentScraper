#### <span id="page-6-0"></span>Assessment details

Written examination: 1 hour 30 mins Set and marked by WJEC 35% of qualification 70 marks

This unit requires learners to respond to a range of questions with fixed responses and responses in Cymraeg/English, to translate short extracts from the assessed language into Cymraeg/English and to respond in the assessed language to a choice of written tasks.

The unit is divided into 2 sections – Section A and Section B. Each section will cover all broad themes.

In Section A, a reading task will provide the stimulus for the translation task. Translation in this context means a sufficient and appropriate rendering of the meaning of the original language.

Texts will only use the grammar and vocabulary specified in this specification. Words outside of the specification grammar and vocabulary lists will be glossed. For written production, the expected language will be from the specified content (vocabulary and grammar), with equal credit given for language used that is beyond the defined content but that fulfils the task requirements.

The Rubrics will be in Cymraeg/English.

Stimuli will be in the assessed language.

All responses will be non-verbal and in Cymraeg/English, apart from the response in Section B to the extended writing task.

**Learners are not permitted to use a dictionary in any part of the assessment.**

**Section A:** four comprehension questions and translation (AO2 – 30 marks)

Learners will read a range of texts linked to each of the broad themes:

- texts based on practical transactional language such as information notices and signs
- factual texts such as an e-mail, poster, web page, letter, newspaper article, flyer, graph or advert
- prose such as continuous literary texts, extracts from short stories and magazine articles.

Learners will demonstrate understanding of the texts by responding to a range of questions in Cymraeg/English. Question types will include: multiple choice questions, true/false with justification, matching words/phrases with definitions/images, matching statements with their source, short answers in Cymraeg/English, gap-fill, finish the sentences and comprehension questions to demonstrate understanding.

#### **Section B:**

Question 6 (35 marks) (AO2 – 20 marks) (AO3 – 15 marks)

Learners will write an extended piece of writing in response to written prompts. There will be a choice of three options in Cymraeg/English, one from each broad theme. Learners will respond to the question prompts writing up to a maximum of 120 words in the assessed language.

| Reading and Writing | Learners should be able to: <ul><li>understand and respond to different types of written language in a range of contexts</li><li>understand and respond to different types of language written for different purposes and audience</li><li>identify the overall message, key points and opinions in spoken and written passages, some involving more complex language, and draw conclusions where appropriate</li><li>use knowledge of grammar to support understanding, including recognising the relationship between past, present and future events</li><li>translate short and simple texts from Spanish to Cymraeg/English</li><li>communicate clearly and effectively in writing for a variety of purposes, including communicating information, describing, narrating, expressing and justifying opinions</li><li>communicate meaning in writing in a range of formal and informal contexts</li><li>use knowledge of vocabulary and grammar to communicate meaningfully, using more complex structures which</li></ul> | Choose texts that are both fiction and non-fiction. Teachers will need to adapt the texts they find to ensure that the words are on the grammar or vocabulary lists. Use websites such as: <ul><li>https://elpais.com/</li><li>https://www.bbc.com/mundo</li><li>https://www.elviajedetuvida.es/ Use travel websites for local areas/countries. You can also use creation tools such as Canva to create images which include text. Provide reading activities that develop both close reading and skimming and scanning. Match-up activities: Learners can match-up key words in Cymraeg/English with words in the text. This will develop their skimming and scanning skills. They can then fill in gaps such as:</li><li>The customer wants to drink</li><li>There are people living in Madrid. Teachers could ask learners to find the synonym/antonym such as a synonym for Quisiera. Treasure hunt: give learners sentences in Cymraeg/ English and have the Spanish translation around the room. Ask learners to go around the room and find the correct translation. Add extra challenge by asking them to remember the sentence rather than bring the Cymraeg/English around the room too.</li></ul> |

reference past, present and future events where appropriate.

Develop narrow reading skills by providing learners with three or four texts that are very similar, apart from a few details. For example, include three paragraphs about young people at school. Teachers can then ask questions such as:

- Who likes Maths and English?
- Who has lunch at 1.15pm?

Choose texts that include a range of tenses. Teachers should gradually build up the complexity of the language throughout the text. For example, start with several sentences in the present tense and then include sentences in the future tense including some more complex vocabulary such as *Iré a Venezuela para mejorar el español ya que quiero estudiar los idiomas en la universidad.*

Provide learners with sentences in Spanish and their Cymraeg/ English equivalent. However, include mistranslations in Cymraeg/ English. Ask learners to fix the translations so that they are correct.

Provide learners with gap-fill activities, however include more possible answers than gaps. These tasks can be used to focus on a particular grammatical element such as the agreement of adjectives.

Provide learners with three or four slightly different texts and ask them to spot the difference:

Use the texts as model examples for learners' own writing. Learners should use the texts to develop a bank of vocabulary.

Create tasks that challenge learners to improve the quality of their writing:

Develop writing tasks of 120 words. These tasks should focus on one of the three broad themes. Include one bullet point in each of the tenses: past, present and future.

Encourage learners to give opinions and justify them.

Teachers may wish to use acronyms such as SDORFP to encourage learners to extend their language:

- S= statement
- D= development
- O= opinion
- R= reason
- F= future
- P= past

SDORFP: ¿Cuáles deportes practicas?

Juego al tenis al polideportivo. Me chifla jugar al tenis puesto me relaja. El año que viene jugaré al tenis de mesa ya que opino que es interesante. Sin embargo cuando yo era pequeño no jugaba al tenis ni al tenis de mesa porque era muy perezoso.

{11}------------------------------------------------

Use challenge grids to encourage learners to develop their written language:

| <u> </u>                   |                    |                          |                     |                    |

| Pienso que | me interesan | son divertidas | ya que | Pink 10 points |

Teachers may wish to start by using writing frames to support learners as they develop their writing. Additionally, keyword mats or aids can encourage learners to develop the complexity of their language. As the course progresses, they should have opportunities to write without the support of these aids.

Provide learners with a simple sentence such as *estudio inglés* and ask them to improve it.

{12}------------------------------------------------

Learners will be required to read a range of texts linked to each of the broad themes including:

- texts based on practical transactional language such as information notices and signs
- factual texts such as an e-mail, poster, web page, letter, newspaper article, flyer, graph, advert
- prose such as continuous literary texts, extracts from short stories, magazine articles.

Provide learners with opportunities to read different texts such as travel blogs, magazine articles, news articles, fact files, posters, emails and infographics (ensure the words are on the WJEC vocabulary or grammar lists or include a glossary):

- Use paragraphs or pages from books that have been translated into Spanish such as Heartstopper, Harry Potter etc.
- Use the websites mentioned throughout this teachers' guide to find authentic texts.
- Find images of menus, tourist flyers or create them using tools such as Canva.
- Use Twitter to follow governments from different countries. Encourage learners to also do this to develop their reading and translation skills.

Learners will be required to:

- demonstrate understanding of the texts by responding to a range of questions in Cymraeg/English
- translate sentences into Cymraeg/English within a context
- write in Spanish in response to a stimulus.

Highlight key sentences or phrases in the text and ask pupils to translate them from Spanish to Cymraeg/ English. These should become increasingly more challenging.

Translation activities: provide learners with several sentences to translate into Cymraeg/English and then into Spanish:

- 1. Detesto la música de Andalucía porque es lenta.
- 2. Prefiero la música de Galicia porque me gustan los instrumentos.
- 3. Me gusta mucho la música de Galicia porque me gusta mucho el ritmo.
- 4. I hate the music from the Basque country because it is boring.
- 5. I love the music from Valencia because it is fast.

Then challenge learners to create their own sentences.

Include 'tangled translations' [\(Gianfranco Conti, PhD. Co-author of 'The Language](https://gianfrancoconti.com/)  [Teacher toolkit'\)](https://gianfrancoconti.com/). This involves having a text in the middle that is a mix of Spanish and Cymraeg/English. On one side learners have to fully translate the text into Spanish and on the other side they must fully translate the text into Cymraeg/English.

{13}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_13_Figure_1.jpeg)

Create a reading activity based on one of the three themes and use it as a springboard for a writing activity. For example, read a text about young people at school in Spain. Learners can then use this to write a response to a Spanish pen pal explaining what school is like in the UK, what their primary school was like and what they plan to do next year.

## <span id="page-14-0"></span>Learning Experiences

Learners should be encouraged to consider the following learning experiences and skills to further develop their understanding, appreciation and awareness of the subject content. Information in the table below provides opportunities for teachers to integrate the learning experiences into delivery.

| Learning Experience                                                                                                         | Exemplification of Learning Experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| learn about the culture and society in the countries and communities where the international language is spoken | Learners will read different types of texts from across the Spanish-speaking world. These texts will cover the three themes and will allow learners to compare life in Wales with life in different countries. |
|  | Centres may wish to ensure that they choose texts from different Spanish-speaking countries to ensure learners engage with a broad range of cultures and communities, |
| explore the cross-cutting themes of human rights and diversity, including Black, | Texts will include people from a diverse range of backgrounds including Black, Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds. |
| Asian and minority ethnic perspectives, identity, culture and contributions | When looking at Spanish words from across the Spanish speaking community, centres can highlight words that have been taken from indigenous communities. For example, the word 'chocolate' comes from the word 'xocolātl'. This also leads to interesting discussions around colonisation and the importance of chocolate in different cultures. |
| have direct or indirect contact with speakers of the language | Centres and learners will be able to use initiatives such as MFL Mentoring – Modern Foreign Languages and Llwybrau at Ieithoedd Cymru Routes into Languages Cymru. |
|  | Both schemes support international languages and multilingualism in the new curriculum for Wales. Centres can request visits from Mentors and Student Language Ambassadors and sessions can be in person or online. |
|  | Centres can also apply for funding via Taith - Hwb (gov.wales) to take part in educational international exchanges. |
|  | Learners will have contact with speakers of the language through reading authentic texts. |
|  | Learners may also benefit from hearing text read aloud as this will help them to identify cognates. |
|  | Learners may engage with Spanish-speakers through pen pal programmes. |

{15}------------------------------------------------

{16}------------------------------------------------

making appropriate connections with other parts of the curriculum to develop and deepen learners' bilingual and multilingual skills

Learners will be encouraged to make connections with other parts of the curriculum throughout their learning of Spanish with cross-curricular connections to humanities subjects and of course with the other languages within the LLC Area of Learning Experience.

Learners will be expected to read and translate from texts which cover the three themes.

Learners will need to write 120 words on one of the three themes.

Across the three themes there are opportunities to engage with different areas of the curriculum. For example, learners may read about different important religious festivals celebrated across the Spanish-speaking world. They may also read about different sports and ways to keep physically and mentally healthy.

# Opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales

# <span id="page-17-0"></span>**Curriculum for Wales Strands Cross-cutting Themes** Local, National & International Contexts, and Sustainability **There are many opportunities to include Local, National & International Contexts and Sustainability in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they will be engaging with texts from the Spanish-speaking world. They will then use these texts as a springboard to write about themselves. Below are some examples of how Local, National & International Contexts and Sustainability can be embedded into teaching and learning:** *Example* • When choosing texts try to ensure they come from different Spanish-speaking countries. Consider how the texts develop learners' cultural understanding. For example, choose a text that talks about typical Christmas dishes across the Spanish-speaking world. Learners can identify the main dishes and say which ones they would like to try. They could then compare this with traditional British and Welsh food. They could also consider the reasons why food is different across the world. • Provide learners with two texts side by side, one about Wales and one about a Spanishspeaking country. For example, include a travel blog about Ystradfellte and one about Iguazú. Then create a chart where learners note key facts about the two waterfalls such as height, depth, number of visitors, etc.

{18}------------------------------------------------

LGBTQ+ people across the Spanish-speaking world.

• During LGBTQ+ History Month and Pride discuss the history and lived experiences of

{19}------------------------------------------------

{20}------------------------------------------------

**There are many opportunities to include Career and Work-Related Experiences (CWRE) in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they will read and write about their future plans. They will also need to challenge themselves to use more complex language.**

**Below are some examples of how CWRE can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### *Example*

- Provide texts that discuss what school is like in Spanish-speaking countries. Similarly, find texts that talk about work and unemployment in Spanish-speaking countries.
- Learners can use these texts as a springboard to discuss what school is like in Wales and what they would like to do in the future.

## • Discuss with learners the benefit of learning another language. Teachers may wish to look at Routes into Languages for supporting resources: [https://routesintolanguagescymru.co.uk/.](https://routesintolanguagescymru.co.uk/)

- Consider encouraging learners to become Language Ambassadors. In this role they could teach younger learners about Spanish or support events for European Day of Languages.
- Encourage learners to experiment with their language and remind them that at GCSE we do not expect perfection. Create activities where learners have to write about a specific topic such as healthy eating. Include a point system: 1 point = present tense, 2 points = past or future tense, 4 points = idiomatic expression or exclamation, 5 points = si fuera sentence, etc.

## Careers and Work-Related Experiences

{21}------------------------------------------------

{22}------------------------------------------------

Understanding the number system helps us to represent and compare relationships between numbers and quantities

**There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they need to be able read numbers.**

**Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

## *Example*

- Create a version of "Race Across the World" for learners. Provide learners with a start and end point. Then give them a budget. Learners could either carry out their own research or provide them with information packs on routes, hotel and travel costs and opportunities for work. Learners need to work out how quickly they can reach their destination whilst staying in budget. This could then be a springboard into a writing activity.
- Include texts that use percentages and big numbers. Encourage learners to highlight and record these numbers for future reference.

| Creativity and Innovation                | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  | <ul><li>Creativity will be developed every time learners write something. Use a reading activity as a springboard for a writing task.</li></ul> |
|  | <ul><li>For example, provide learners with a reading task about eco-tourism in Peru. They then need to imagine they are setting up an eco-tourism holiday and say what they would include.</li></ul> |
| Critical Thinking and Problem Solving | There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they need to be language detectives to develop their receptive skills. |
|  | Below are some examples of how Critical Thinking and Problem Solving can be embedded into teaching and learning: |
|                                          | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  | <ul><li>Reading can be used to teach new vocabulary and grammatical patterns. For example, show learners a text that includes regular -ar verbs in the preterite. Ask learners to identify these verbs and see if they can create a rule. Teachers could then show learners a text that includes -ar, -er and -ir regular verbs in the preterite and ask them to do the same thing and expand the rule. Thirdly, create a text which includes common irregulars and once again ask learners to develop a rule. You may amalgamate these steps depending on the ability of your class.</li></ul> |

| Integral Skills           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  | <ul><li>Similarly, create a text with lots of new vocabulary and then provide a table with the words in English. Ask learners to use cognates, previous knowledge and context to identify the Spanish words in the text.</li></ul> |
| Planning and Organisation | There are many opportunities to include Planning and Organisation in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they will need to plan how long to spend on the reading, translation and writing tasks. Below are some examples of how Planning and Organisation can be embedded into teaching and learning: |
|                           | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  | <ul><li>Provide learners with one reading activity and give them a set amount of time to complete it. Then give them several reading activities in a set time frame. Discuss with them how long they think they should spend on each task. Then give them the opportunity to complete it. Review the task afterwards and discuss what they could do differently next time.</li></ul> |
|  | <ul><li>Provide learners with bullet points on one of the three themes. Encourage learners to highlight key words in the bullet points and use this to create a plan. Teachers may wish to use acronyms such as:</li><li>AVOCADO ~ Adjectives Verbs Opinions Conjunctions Adverbs Description Outstanding phrases.</li><li>SDORFP ~ Statement Development Opinion Reason Future Past.</li></ul> |

|  | There are many opportunities to include Personal Effectiveness in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they will learn to take more responsibility for their own learning. Below are some examples of how Personal Effectiveness can be embedded into teaching and learning: |  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
| Personal Effectiveness | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |  |
|  | <ul><li>Encourage learners to create their own vocabulary and grammar lists which they can refer to when reading or writing.</li></ul> |  |
|  | <ul><li>Teach learners how to use physical or online dictionaries effectively so that this can be a reference point for them.</li></ul> |  |
