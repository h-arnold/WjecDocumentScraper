Ta Askatasuna (ETA) established their totalitarian regime. This situation affects two families
that were friends in the past, but not in the present. This text looks at the impact ETA has
had on the Basque region. It explores friendship, family and loyalty. It explores ideas around
identity and what it means to be Basque. There are many comparisons that could be drawn
between life in the Basque region and life in Wales.

Title: Manuelito by Elisa Amado (author) and Abraham Urias (illustrator).
Broad Theme: Language for travel.

This graphic novel tells the story of 13-year-old Manuelito from Guatemala who is seeking
asylum in the USA.  It shows life in Guatemala and why people from Latin America make the
journey to the USA.

the civil war. When boys turn 12, they are forced to join the army. Trigger warning: there are
some upsetting scenes, but it is appropriate for children over 12. The film shows what
everyday life was like for people in El Salvador during the civil war. It also highlights issues
such as poverty and provides a background to understanding some of the current challenges
that El Salvador faces.

Information for candidates

The following information has been taken from the JCQ Information for candidates – non-
examination assessments and the JCQ Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use in Assessments:
Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications. This tells you about things that you must and must
not do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not
understand, you must ask your teacher.

Preparing your work

•  When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you need to

•

•

ensure that your final product reflects your own independent work and isn’t copied or
paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you must tell
your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
If you worked as part of a group on a task, you must each write up your own account of
the assignment. Even if the data you have is the same, you must describe in your own
words how that data was obtained, and you must independently draw your own
conclusions from the data.

•  Take care of your work and keep it safe. Do not leave it lying around where your

classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You
must always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; do not
share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your
password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
•  Do not be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI

tools and chatbots) – this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort
of copying.

•  You must not write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

Plagiarism

Plagiarism involves taking someone else’s words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them
off as your own. It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously. Don’t think you
won’t be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:
•  Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
•  Markers are highly experienced subject specialists – they may have read the source you

•

are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!
Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match
phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and
style of writing or punctuation.

Penalties for breaking the regulations

the piece of work will be awarded zero marks

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be
applied:
•
•  you will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question
•  you will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series
•  you will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of

time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

Remember – it’s your qualification so it needs to be your own work.

MARK SCHEME

Guidance for examiners

Generic marking principles

•  Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).

•  Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for
the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the
quality of the candidate responses seen).

•  Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme.
Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

Positive marking

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit
should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of
penalising candidates for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to
achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be
deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied
precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates’ answers. The list is not
exhaustive. The inclusion of ‘Credit any other valid response.’ (or similar instruction) within
mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates’ responses. Credit should be
given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates’ answers.

Banded mark schemes

For band marked questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the
assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in
candidates’ answers. It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate’s response. As
noted above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive, and candidates do not have
to include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the
requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it
contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been
provided, no marks should be awarded.

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each
candidate’s response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills,
knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors
or omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate’s answer to pick out the evidence
that is being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied. This is done
as a two-stage process.

GCSE Spanish Unit 2: Reading and Writing

7

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2024

CYFRINACHOL - CONFIDENTIAL

CYFRINACHOL - CONFIDENTIAL

Stage 1 – Deciding on the band

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate’s answer and check
whether it matches the descriptors for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are
satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band
until the descriptors most closely matches the work.

Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark

Having determined the appropriate band, deciding on the mark within a band will be made
on the basis of a ‘best fit’ procedure, weaknesses in some areas being compensated for by
strengths in others.

Examiners should use the full range of marks available to them. Marking should be positive,
rewarding achievement rather that penalising failure or omissions. The awarding of marks
must be directly related to the marking criteria, and all responses must be marked according
to the banded levels provided for each question.

Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be provided during
standardising and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work.
Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the standardising material as they apply the
mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the
work submitted.

This mark scheme instructs examiners to look for and reward valid alternatives where
indicative content is suggested for an answer. This is not a checklist for expected content in
an answer, or set out as a 'model answer', as responses must be marked in the banded
levels of response provided for each question. Where a candidate provides a response that
contains aspects or approaches not included in the indicative content, examiners should use
their professional judgement to determine the validity of the response in light of the task and
reward as directed by the bands. Candidates are free to choose any approach that is
relevant to the set task. Candidates can (and will most likely) incorporate ideas other than
those mentioned in the mark scheme.

Glossary of terms

The following glossary of terms provides guidance on terms used within the banded mark
schemes.

Major error

An error that impedes communication and prevents the
meaning being accurately conveyed.

For example:
•

Incorrect verb forms resulting in confusion about the
subject and / or the tense:
•  Yo vamos al parque
•  Tu ir al concierto

•  Significant spelling errors which make the word

unrecognisable in Spanish and / or changes the meaning:
•  Sabo espanol
•  Haco mis deberes

•  Expressions of time in conflict with verb tenses, making the

detail about when the activity happened unclear:
•  Ayer, voy a ir
•  Mañana, fui al mercado

•  Mother-tongue word swaps:

•  Me gusta football.

Minor error

An error that does not impede communication and allows the
meaning to be conveyed.

For example:
•  Minor spelling errors which don’t affect the communication:

•  Como una hamburgusa
•  Tengo una classe

•  Missing accents which don’t affect the meaning or tense:

•
futbol
•  natacion

•

•

Incorrect accents which don’t affect the overall meaning:
•  Estudiá griego
•  Tengo un gató

Incorrect gender and errors in agreement:
•  Ella es bonito
•  El perro es linda

Clear

The message is unambiguous.

Comprehensive

Including everything that is necessary – complete.

Detailed

Giving a lot of information with many details.

Understandable

Able to be understood.

Addresses

Development /
developed

Extended

Complex language

Evidence of response. For example, candidates should include
all bullet points, but equal coverage is not expected.

Including additional detail which elaborates. It can be a clause
or separate phrase.

A longer sequence which may include additional clause(s)
giving further details, reasoning and / or opinion.

More sophisticated linguistic constructions, which may include:
longer sentence with connectives (e.g. because, such as,
•
when…)
•
infinitive constructions
•  use of (multiple) pronouns
•  use of adverbs
•  word order that is different to English.

Communication

Exchanging of information.

Relevant

Connected or appropriate to the stimulus.

Straightforward

Easy to understand or simple.

Well-reasoned

Clear and carefully thought out.

Differentiation of descriptors in the mark scheme

The following words are used from top to lower bands in all banded mark schemes:
•  consistent(ly) / always / almost always / all / almost all / highly
•  main(ly) / most(ly) / often / frequent
•  generally
•  some / sometimes / occasionally
•  basic / little
limited / few
•
•  minimal / rarely.

Please note that these should be viewed in conjunction with the descriptor as they may not
always go from top to lower, for example: frequent errors would be in a lower mark band.
