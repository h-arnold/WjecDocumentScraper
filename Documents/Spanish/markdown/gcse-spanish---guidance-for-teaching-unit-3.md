Teacher Guidance

Listening  Learners should be able to:

•  develop their listening skills to understand and evaluate

what they hear

•  demonstrate an understanding of spoken language when

•

listening to one or more speakers in a range of contexts
identify the overall message, key points and opinions in
spoken extracts, some involving more complex language,
and draw conclusions where appropriate

•  use knowledge of grammar to support understanding,
including recognising the relationship between past,
present and future events.

Choose a variety of extracts that include a variety of accents from
Spanish-speaking countries and communities related to the three broad
themes (language for study and work/language for leisure and
wellbeing/language for travel) in order for learners to familiarise
themselves with diverse accents and pronunciation. These could be
chosen from real life podcasts, songs, announcements adverts or
generated by using AI sites such as www.narakeet.com.

Recognizing tenses could also be adapted into a multiple-choice activity
with learners having to highlight which verb was used during the extract
or noting the verb on a mini whiteboard.

Hablé con el jefe. - Hablar/hablo/hablé/voy a hablar/ hablaría
Visito un museo de arquitectura – Visitar/Visito/Visitamos/Visité

Ensure learners are familiar with temporal markers such as hoy, ayer,
mañana, último and próximo. Tasks could include creating a timeline of
events whilst listening to the extract:
Ayer, fuimos al cine.
Mañana por la mañana voy a tomar el bus al aeropuerto,
El último fin de semana trabajé en un restaurante.
El próximo mes voy a visitar el museo.

Alternatively, learners could tick the correct marker that matches the
event.

Ayer  Mañana  El último

fin de semana

El próximo
mes

Ir al cine.
Tomar el bus.
Trabajar en un
restaurante.
Visitar el museo.

See above links for a range of authentic resources.

Ensure that learners are familiar with all formats in order to ensure
familiarity with assessment material.

Provide listening activities that provide a variety of activities such as
multiple-choice questions, short answer questions (3-4 words),
identifying true statements, matching statements with their source and
gap-fill.

Multiple-choice questions:
Hay una playa bonita cerca del hotel que es muy conveniente. El hotel
tiene un comedor grande y una piscina con vistas del mar.
1.  There is a parc/beach/theatre near the hotel.
2.  The beach is big/pretty/small.
3.  The hotel has a dining room/food/bar.

These could increase in difficulty with single words being selected at first
and then progressing to more complex sentences as well as the use of
longer extracts.

Short answer questions:
Un lugar hermoso a visitar es el jardín público porque tiene monumentos
importantes y un lago impresionante. Se puede ir a los numerosos
restaurantes cerca del parque que sirven una gran variedad de comidas
como pescado, hamburguesas y comida tradicional como la paella.
Recomendemos probar el zumo de naranja fresco, es muy apetitoso.

Dictation will improve learners’ attention to pronunciation, grammar and
sentence structure. Starting with short simple sentences and progressing
to more complex passages will aid in building learners’ confidence whilst
completing the task.

When preparing learners to respond in Cymraeg/English, building up the
complexity of the task by first providing multiple choice answers and
diminishing support given over time would support their learning.
Alternatively, ask learners to summarise the listening extract prior to
moving on to respond to specific questions in Cymraeg/English. Drawing
learners’ attention to cognates to support understanding would help with
this task.

Cross-curricular Skills – Literacy

GCSE Spanish Unit 3 Guidance for Teaching 24

There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities
are important to Learners because it will help them to develop their listening and
comprehension skills in Spanish whilst also developing their reading comprehension in
Spanish and Cymraeg/Welsh.

Below are some examples of how Literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning:

Example

•  Learners should listen to a variety of extracts including the following formats: adverts,

messages, podcasts, announcements, conversations and interviews regarding a wide variety
of themes promoting learners’ ability to engage with the language from a variety of sources
and in a variety of genres and media.

•  Using activities such as multiple-choice questions, short answer questions (3-4 words),
identifying true statements, matching statements with their source and gap-fill will allow
learners to develop their Spanish vocabulary as well as their grammatical awareness.

•  Listening to extracts in a variety of tenses will allow learners to widen their grammatical

knowledge and improve their oracy through listening to a range of information and ideas from
different viewpoints, identifying how different speakers present specific points of view.

•  Tenses: Present, past and future tenses.

A multiple-choice question or a categorising activity could be adapted to all three broad
themes:

Hablar español es muy importante para tener más oportunidades en el mundo de trabajo.
Comunicar con otros en su idioma es bueno para mantener relaciones positivas con
negocios hispanohablantes.

1.  Understanding/listening to/speaking Spanish is important in the workplace.
2.  Communicating with people/individuals/others in their language builds good relationships with

companies/businesses/people in the Spanish speaking world.

Conditional

1.  Hoy voy a ver mis amigos
2.  Nadé en el mar recientemente.
3.  Hago mucho ejercicio para mantenerme en forma.

•  Gap-fill exercises: Provide transcripts with missing grammatical elements (e.g. verbs,

articles or pronouns) that learners will fill in while listening. This video discusses El Quechua:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv-7JZYWBoc.

Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities
are important to Learners because numeracy is essential to everyday life and prepares
learners for practical, real-world situations in a Spanish-speaking environment.

Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning:

Example

•  There are various ways to incorporate mathematical concepts like numbers, dates, time

and measurements into language learning.

•

Including extracts that contain numbers and percentages will develop learners’
awareness of numeracy in the context of the Spanish-speaking world.

•  Listen to this video on BBC bitesize regarding travelling around town:

https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z4wgqp3/revision/2
Ask learners to answer questions in Cymraeg/English
1.  What time is it when the video starts?
2.  How much does a monthly bus ticket cost?

3.  How long does it take to walk?
4.  When did he arrive home?

•  Listen to public transport timetables where learners hear announcements or

conversations about travel times, departures and arrival. Learners can then fill a table
with the required information:

Andén

Sale a…

Llega a…

El tren por…
Madrid
Barcelona
Sevilla

•  Using an infographic regarding the number of Spanish speakers across the world would
be an opportunity to use numbers within the thematic context or listening to an extract
about salaries in Spanish-speaking countries and communities.

•  Play clips where speakers describe their daily routines using time phrases.

•  Use conversations in shops or markets discussing prices, learners could be asked to

calculate change or currency conversion:

Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competence

There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE Spanish. These
opportunities are important to Learners because learners can use their digital competence
to develop their writing, listening, speaking and reading skills.

Below are some examples of how Digital Competence can be embedded into teaching and
learning:

Example

Interacting and Collaborating

•  Learners could use their digital competence to find appropriate listening extras, or could use

their digital competence to write and create their own listening extract through the use of sites
such as narakeet.com, this could be done collaboratively or individually.

•  Alternatively, learners could produce their own text and record it themselves developing their

writing and speaking skills in order to create a listening task for other learners.

•  Apps such as Quizlet, Duolingo and Memrise provide listening exercises and quizzes that

learners can use to practice comprehension.

•

Interactive websites such as Lyricstraining.com offer opportunities for learners to practice
listening skills through filling the gaps as they listen to the lyrics.

Integral Skills

•  Alternatively, learners could produce their own text and record it themselves, developing their

writing and speaking skills to create a listening task for other learners.

•  Learners could create their own podcast individually or in groups on a given theme.

There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE
Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they will have to develop
their receptive skills and their problem-solving skills through using the process of
elimination during a number of listening activities.

Below are some examples of how Critical Thinking and Problem Solving can be
embedded into teaching and learning:

Example

Critical Thinking and Problem
Solving

•  Whilst listening to an extract learners can use their critical thinking skills in order to

discern which statement is true.

•  Alternatively, learners can use their problem-solving skills when completing multiple
choice questions by discerning from the information required which is likely to be the
correct answer. The use of distractors can be used to increase the difficulty of the task.

There are many opportunities to include Planning and Organisation in GCSE Spanish.
These opportunities are important to Learners because learners need to plan and
organise their learning effectively in preparation for the listening exam.

Below are some examples of how Planning and Organisation can be embedded into
teaching and learning:

Example

•  Learners will be given three opportunities to listen to each extract during the

assessment. Learners should ensure that they have listened to the instructions and read
the question carefully as this will allow learners to better plan the answer options.
Encourage learners to underline key words in the questions or key elements such as are
they listening out for a name, noun, number or place.

Planning and Organisation

•  This video from BBC bitesize discusses future education and employment:
https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/z7t8p9q/articles/z6rykhv#zj7dh4j

•

If the task was ticking the correct statement such as the exercise below, learners should
be encouraged to note the key vocabulary that they are listening out for in Spanish. The
key vocabulary in the below example would be: un trabajo, estudiar, la universiadad and
el colegio.

What does Diana’s first friend want to do? Tick (✓) the correct

•  When preparing for Unit 3 encourage learners to organise timetabled practice with the
aim of dedicating a specific amount of time to develop their listening skills in Spanish.
Encourage learners to listen to podcasts, online radio stations and short audio news
items prior to the listening exam for targeted amounts of time such as, listening to two
minutes of a podcast and noting the key points discussed before moving on to the next
two minutes.

•

It might be useful for some learners to focus their listening through completing an activity
such as below during their timetabled practice:

What did I listen
to?

What cognates
did I hear?

What familiar
vocabulary did I
understand?

What could I
deduce?

What
vocabulary
would I like to
understand?

Encourage learners to access listening resources independently:
