Use audio files from past papers and adapt questions.

Use transcripts when available. These can be adapted for a variety of tasks such as gap fill exercises, putting the text in chronological order or a 'spot the error' task.

Ensure that learners listen to conversations between Spanish speakers noting the core messages or core information discussed.

Encourage learners to use their previous knowledge as well as cognates to note the key elements of the extract.

Choose texts that use a variety of tenses. Tasks could include noting all the verbs in the present/past/future or conditional tenses to familiarise learners with core grammatical elements.

| Present | Past | Future | Conditional |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|
|         |      |        |             |
|         |      |        |             |

- *1. Hoy voy a ir a la fiesta de Marina.*
- 2. *Fui de vacaciones a la playa recientemente.*
- 3. *Como mucha comida rápida los fines de semana es malo para la salud.*
- 4. *Escucharía la radio para relajarme.*

{11}------------------------------------------------

Alternatively, the same text could be used to practice key vocabulary

| Verbs | Nouns | Adjectives |
|-------|-------|------------|
|       |       |            |
|       |       |            |

Recognizing tenses could also be adapted into a multiple-choice activity with learners having to highlight which verb was used during the extract or noting the verb on a mini whiteboard.

*Hablé con el jefe. - Hablar/hablo/hablé/voy a hablar/ hablaría Visito un museo de arquitectura – Visitar/Visito/Visitamos/Visité*

Ensure learners are familiar with temporal markers such as hoy, ayer, mañana, último and próximo. Tasks could include creating a timeline of events whilst listening to the extract:

*Ayer, fuimos al cine.*

*Mañana por la mañana voy a tomar el bus al aeropuerto,*

*El último fin de semana trabajé en un restaurante.*

*El próximo mes voy a visitar el museo.*

Alternatively, learners could tick the correct marker that matches the event.

| Ayer | Mañana | El último     | El próximo |                                |
|------|--------|---------------|------------|--------------------------------|
|      |        | fin de semana | mes        |                                |
|      |        |               |            | Ir al cine.                    |
|      |        |               |            | Tomar el bus.                  |
|  |  |  |  | Trabajar en un restaurante. |
|      |        |               |            | Visitar el museo.              |

Ensure that the listening activities correlate to the WJEC vocabulary and grammar list. Use glossaries as support.

{12}------------------------------------------------

Learners will be required to:

- listen to extracts including the following formats: adverts, messages, podcasts, announcements, conversations and interviews
- respond to a range of questions in Cymraeg/English.

See above links for a range of authentic resources.

Ensure that learners are familiar with all formats in order to ensure familiarity with assessment material.

Provide listening activities that provide a variety of activities such as multiple-choice questions, short answer questions (3-4 words), identifying true statements, matching statements with their source and gap-fill.

### **Multiple-choice questions:**

*Hay una playa bonita cerca del hotel que es muy conveniente. El hotel tiene un comedor grande y una piscina con vistas del mar.*

- 1. There is a parc/beach/theatre near the hotel.
- 2. The beach is big/pretty/small.
- 3. The hotel has a dining room/food/bar.

These could increase in difficulty with single words being selected at first and then progressing to more complex sentences as well as the use of longer extracts.

### **Short answer questions:**

*Un lugar hermoso a visitar es el jardín público porque tiene monumentos importantes y un lago impresionante. Se puede ir a los numerosos restaurantes cerca del parque que sirven una gran variedad de comidas como pescado, hamburguesas y comida tradicional como la paella. Recomendemos probar el zumo de naranja fresco, es muy apetitoso.*

| 1. | Where is it recommended to visit? |
|----|--------------------------------------|
| 2. | Where can you go nearby? |
| 3. | What drink is recommended? |
|    |                                      |

{13}------------------------------------------------

### **Identifying true statements:**

*Alex: Personalmente me encanta las noticias pues un trabajo ideal para mí sería como periodista. Pienso que para ser periodista debes ser bien organizado y que debes comunicar bien con otros. Creo que me gustaría también trabajar con una variedad de gente porque sería entretenido.* 

Tick (✓) **two** true statements:

| Alex thinks organisation skills are important.          |             |
| Alex would like to work with different people. |  |
| Alex would like to be an entertainer.                   |             |

### **Matching statements with their source:**

*Miguel: Voy a usar menos agua.*

*Guillermo: Tengo la intención de comprar cosas del mercado de mi pueblo.*

*Paula: Creo que escribir una carta tendrá un gran impacto.*

## Opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales

### **Curriculum for Wales Strands**

### **Cross-cutting Themes**

**There are many opportunities to include Local, National & International Contexts and Sustainability in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they will be engaging in listening tasks from Spanish-speaking countries and communities.**

**Below are some examples of how Local, Nationals & International Contexts can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

### *Example*

### <span id="page-20-0"></span>Local, National & International Contexts

When choosing listening material, it is important that they come from different Spanish-speaking countries and communities as these can be used to highlight the differences and similarities between Cymru/Wales and Spanish-speaking countries and communities in order to develop learners cultural understanding.

Examples of possible learning activities are:

- Listening to promotional material/adverts about Wales targeting Spanish-speaking countries and identifying regional attractions and points of interest from websites such as: Visit Wales: [https://youtu.be/5iCHP5nFXBI?si=sY06unyjtdc7MqjZ.](https://youtu.be/5iCHP5nFXBI?si=sY06unyjtdc7MqjZ)
- Listening to a podcast/conversation/interview about minority languages in Spain/Spanishspeaking countries and noting the similarities/differences between them and Cymraeg/Welsh. An example of this would be listening to an extract about Catalan or Galician and noting the differences and similarities between these and Cymraeg/Welsh.
