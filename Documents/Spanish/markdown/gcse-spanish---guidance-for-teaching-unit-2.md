| Reading and Writing: | Learners should be able to: <ul><li>understand and respond to written language</li><li>use their knowledge of grammar and vocabulary to support their understanding of the work</li><li>use a variety of language patterns and different verb tenses effectively</li><li>use complex structures where appropriate</li><li>select relevant vocabulary and grammar to express meaning</li><li>express themselves in written Spanish to demonstrate their understanding, ideas and opinions.</li></ul> | Teachers may wish to begin by providing learners with an overview of the text in Cymraeg/ English or Spanish. This will enable learners to familiarise themselves with the main events and characters. Classes could also watch a film with the English subtitles or read a dual language version of the text. Remember that this is not a translation task so learners will not be expected to translate the text into English. The focus is on learners responding to something that they have read in Spanish. Focus could be on key parts of the transcript or text. Teachers should encourage learners to use previous knowledge and cognates to work out the gist of what they are reading. Teachers may choose a particular part of the text to focus on grammatical understanding, for example looking at the past tense. The part of the transcript or text that is the focus could provide learners with vocabulary for the three themes. For example, if there is a scene in which people are eating, this can be used as a springboard to learn or revise food vocabulary. Teachers should encourage learners to build up a bank of key words from the text and regularly test them on these. Provide tasks which allow learners to practise a range of tenses, for example what happened in the text, what they like about the text and what they would like to read in the future. |  |

{11}------------------------------------------------

Learners will be required to:

- study a work in Spanish
- demonstrate their understanding of the work by responding in Spanish to a task set in Cymraeg/English.

Teachers could set written tasks based on a chosen text of both 70 and 130 words. Learners could be asked to summarise the text or write about the main events. Ask learners to give opinions on the text, for example their favourite part, their favourite character, their least favourite character, what they enjoyed and what they didn't enjoy about the text.

Ensure learners have plenty of opportunities to write 70 words in 20 minutes focusing on the plot, main events, favourite characters, opinions on setting, etc.

Ensure learners have plenty of opportunities to write 130 words in 40 minutes in which they note the main events, say what they liked/ disliked and why, provide examples, say if they would recommend the text, say what they would like to read next, etc. Ensure learners have opportunities to write both 70 words and 130 words with a one hour time limit.

Learners should be provided with opportunities to justify their opinions.

Ensure learners have the vocabulary to talk about the plot, characters and setting of text (time and place). Teachers may wish to challenge the more able learners by encouraging them to write about the main themes of the text or a lesson that they learnt from studying it.

A table could be created such as the one below:

| Name of character | Description (physical and personality) | What they do/ role in text. | Things I like about this character and why. | Things I dislike about this character and why. |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chava | Chava tiene once años y es salvadoreño. Tiene el pelo moreno y los ojos marrones. Es bastante bajo. | Es el personaje principal de la película. Vive en un pueblo que está atrapado entre el ejército y la guerrilla. | Me cae bien Chava puesto que es muy leal y siempre intenta ayudar a sus amigos y a su familia. | Me molestó cuando escuchaba a la radio enfrente de los soldados debido que es muy peligroso. |

{12}------------------------------------------------

| Le chifla jugar con los coches. A veces se enoja rápidamente. | Cumplirá doce años pronto y tiene miedo porque a esta edad es cuando el ejercito te toma. No quiere |  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
|  | luchar ya que es joven todavía |  |

For setting (location) learners could look at countries, places in the town, description of places and weather.

For the setting (times) learners could look at time phrases, dates and days.

For main events learners could focus on food, sports, activities, transport, leisure and routine.

Consider providing opportunities to discuss the following questions:

- Can you briefly explain what happens?
- Can you describe the key characters/ events/locations?
- What did you like? Why? Can you provide a specific example?
- What didn't you like? Why? Can you provide a specific example?
- What was your favourite character/moment/setting? Why? Can you give an example?
- What was your least favourite character/moment/setting? Why? Can you give a specific example?
- Would you recommend this book/film to a friend/family member? Why/why not?
- Are there any similarities between your experience/home/country/culture/interests and those in the chosen text? What example can you give?
- Are there any differences between your experience/home/country/culture/interests and those in the chosen text? What example can you give?
- What films/books has your chosen text inspired you to watch/read?
- What do you plan to watch/read next and why?

{13}------------------------------------------------

• What do you think will happen to the characters after the ending? For question 1b, learners will have to give examples. As such, teachers should encourage learners to give examples as well as justification. Teachers may wish to use an acronym such as ORE (Opinion, Reason, Example). An example of this could be: me fascina Inés puesto que ella es muy independiente, por ejemplo, cuando decide ir a América Látina.

| learn about the culture and society in the countries and communities where the international language is spoken | The purpose of Unit 2 is to allow learners to demonstrate their awareness of the culture and society of the countries and communities where Spanish is spoken and make connections with their own languages and culture. |
|  | Unit 2 will provide learners with opportunities to develop their cultural knowledges and understanding of the Sanish-speaking world. The suggested texts come from across the Spanish speaking world to highlight the complexity and variety of the cultures they represent. This will allow learners to draw comparisons between their lives and the lives of Spanish speakers from across the globe. It will also enable them to compare and contrast Welsh culture with the culture of the Spanish-speaking country. |
| explore the cross-cutting themes of human rights and diversity, including Black, Asian and minority ethnic perspectives, identity, culture | Centres are free to choose their work for Unit 2. Works may focus on the cross-cutting themes of human rights and diversity including Black, Asian and minority ethnic perspectives, identity, culture and contributions but this is not compulsory. |
| and contributions | All the suggested texts highlight opportunities to explore the cross-cutting themes. When looking at human rights, centres may find it useful to consult the United Nations Rights of the Child https://www.unicef.es/causas/derechos-ninos. |
|  | Many of the characters within the suggested texts are from Black, Asian or ethnic minorities. This allows learners to engage with the lived experiences of people from different communities in an authentic manner. |
|  | This unit allows centres to explore the impact of colonisation on the Spanish-speaking world and indigenous communities. Learners can then draw links between Spanish and British colonisation and the long-term effects of both. |
| have direct or indirect contact with speakers of the language | Centres and learners will be able to use initiatives such as MFL Mentoring – Modern Foreign Languages and Llwybrau at Ieithoedd Cymru Routes into Languages Cymru. |
|  | Both schemes support international languages and multilingualism in the new curriculum for Wales. Centres can request visits from Mentors and Student Language Ambassadors and sessions can be in person or online. |

{15}------------------------------------------------

|  | Centres can also apply for funding via Taith - Hwb (gov.wales) to take part in educational international exchanges. |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  | By reading or watching a text in Spanish, learners can have direct contact with speakers of the language. |
|  | To support context, centres can show learners videos in Spanish about the country or region that the text is set in. |
|  | Centres may wish to use the British Council to develop links with a school in the country where the text is set. |
| engage with the language from a variety of sources and in a variety of genres and | Learners will have the opportunity to engage with the language from a variety of sources and in a variety of genres and media throughout the specification. |
| media | Learners will be engaging with a text or film which allows them to engage with language from different sources. To support their understanding learners' may also read fact files, watch information videos or read about what daily life is like in the country where the text is set. |
| demonstrate language strategies and language learning skills, including the use of dictionaries | Learners will have the opportunity to demonstrate language strategies and language learning skills, including the use of dictionaries throughout the specification. |
|  | Learning strategies will need to be taught for learners to decode the key messages in the texts. |
|  | Learners will need to be language detectives and use cognates, previous knowledge and context to understand the gist of what they read. |
| translanguaging | Learners will have the opportunity to use their translanguaging skills, throughout the specification. |
|  | Translanguaging is an important element of this unit. Learners may read their chosen text in Cymraeg/English and Spanish. Similarly, they may watch the film in Spanish with English/Welsh subtitles. |
|  | When learners are researching their text and the cultural context, they may find information in Spanish and Cymraeg/English. |
| make use of digital technology | Learners will have the opportunity to make use of digital technology in all units. They may word process their responses for Unit 2 but this is not compulsory. |
|  | Learners may use digital technology to research the text or the culture and history of the country where it is set. |
|  | Learners may also use digital technology to collate their research and re-write it in their own words. |

{16}------------------------------------------------

making appropriate connections with other parts of the curriculum to develop and deepen learners' bilingual and multilingual skills

Learners will be encouraged to make connections with other parts of the curriculum throughout their learning of Spanish, especially in Unit 2, with cross-curricular connections to humanities subjects and of course with the other languages within the LLC Area of Learning Experience.

Unit 2 will allow learners to make connections with different parts of the curriculum. For example, they may learn about the historical, religious and social context in which the text is set. They may also learn about important cultural traditions such as food, dress and festivals.

# Opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales

# **Curriculum for Wales Strands**

#### **Cross-cutting Themes**

**There are many opportunities to include Local, National & International Contexts in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they allow them to make comparisons between a Spanish-speaking country or countries and Wales.**

Below are some examples of how Local, National & International Contexts can be embedded into teaching and learning:

# <span id="page-17-0"></span>Local, National & International Contexts

#### *Example*

- This topic will allow learners to make comparisons between life in Wales and life in Spanish-speaking countries.
- Teachers could create a Venn diagram which allows learners to identify similarities and differences between life in Wales and life in the Spanish-speaking country.
- You may wish to focus on and compare the place where the text is set with the place where your learners live.
- If the text includes LGBTQ+ people, learners could research and compare what it is like to be a LGBTQ+ young person in Wales compared to a Spanish-speaking country.

{18}------------------------------------------------

|  | There are many opportunities to include Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they will be identifying relationships in the text. Below are some examples of how RSE can be embedded into teaching and learning: Example |  |  |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|
| Relationships and Sexuality Education | <ul><li>Teachers may wish to use the text as a springboard for talking about family, friendship or romantic relationships.</li><li>If learners are reading a text with LGBTQ+ characters teachers may wish to look at Spanish gender neutral pronouns.</li><li>Teachers could use the text to note positive and negative relationships and the key characteristics of these.</li><li>To develop empathy, ask learners to put themselves into the place of the characters and say how they would feel/act: Si fuera Chava, me sentiría.</li><li>This is also an excellent opportunity to use more complex language.</li></ul> |  |  |
|  | There are many opportunities to include Human Rights Education and Diversity in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because the texts focus on different peoples' lived experiences. Below are some examples of how Human Rights Education and Diversity can be embedded into teaching and learning: |  |  |
| Human Rights Education and Diversity | Example <ul><li>Many of the suggested texts chosen are based in Latin America. As such, you may wish to provide learners with the context of the colonisation of Latin America and the impact this had on indigenous people. This could also be linked to the negative effects of the British Empire.</li><li>Furthermore, this topic allows teachers to highlight to learners that Spanish speakers come from many different countries and ethnicities.</li><li>Encourage learners to note what other languages are spoken in the region that the text is set (Spain or Latin America). This highlights to learners that we are diverse individuals who do not fit into one category.</li></ul> |  |  |

{19}------------------------------------------------

|  | <ul><li>This topic is a fabulous opportunity to highlight the rich and diverse nature of the Spanish-speaking world.</li><li>If centres choose a text which includes refugees, teachers may wish to look at the rights of refugees. Many of the texts suggested focus on children and so teachers could look at the UNCRC (United Nations Rights of a Child) and consider whether the children in the text are having their rights protected. https://www.unicef.es/causas/derechos-ninos</li></ul> |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  | There are many opportunities to include Career and Work-Related Experiences (CWRE) in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because this unit will challenge pupils to engage with longer texts and use what they have learnt to develop their writing. Below are some examples of how CWRE can be embedded into teaching and learning: |
| Careers and Work Related Experiences | Example <ul><li>Encourage learners to use the bank of vocabulary and grammar that they have created to experiment with language.</li><li>Note the occupations of any characters in the text. If there are any children and young people in the text encourage learners to discuss what school or college looks like them for them. Compare it with school and college in the UK.</li></ul> |

# **Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy**

Understanding the number system helps us to represent and compare relationships between numbers and quantities

**There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they can use numeracy to compare life in Wales with life in a Spanish speaking country by analysing data and graphs.**

**Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

# *Example*

- Find a recipe from the country where the text is set.
- Give learners a realistic budget and ask them to shop online for the ingredients for a certain number of people They could look at 'El Corte Inglés' website, for example.
- Find some graphs showing data on the country where the text is set. Learners could look at population, age, religion and ethnicity. Find similar graphs for Wales and ask learners to identify any key findings.

# **Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competence**

**There are many opportunities to include Digital Competency in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because this task needs to be submitted digitally and so it is essential that learners' digital skills are developed.**

**Below are some examples of how Digital Competency can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### *Example*

#### Citizenship

- Identify any stereotypes portrayed in the text and discuss why these can be harmful. If there are not any stereotypes, consider finding a newspaper article or cartoon that does portray stereotypes, for example about the role of women and compare how this differs to the text.
- Teachers may also highlight that stereotypes differ across cultures.
- If the text includes people using phones and social media, this could provide a springboard into discussing the positives and negatives of social media and how we can keep ourselves safe online.
- As part of this topic, learners may read online about other peoples' interpretations of the text. Teachers can use this as an opportunity to teach learners how to cite correctly. Or if they include any images in a

{22}------------------------------------------------

|  | resource that they create, teach them how to cite where the image has come from and whether it is a reliable source of information. |  |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
| Producing | Example <ul><li>Use Canva or a similar programme to create a new front cover of the text or film.</li><li>Learners could use Google Sites or a similar programme to create a website with key information about the text alongside a country profile.</li></ul> |  |
| Integral Skills              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |  |
| Creativity and Innovation | There are many opportunities to include Creativity and Innovation in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because learners will be inspired by the literature that they engage with and this will act as a springboard for their own creative development. |  |
|  | Below are some examples of how Creativity and Innovation can be embedded into teaching and learning: |  |
|                              | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |  |
|  | <ul><li>Teachers could ask learners to write an alternative ending or create an additional character.</li><li>Learners may wish to use the text as inspiration to write their own story in Spanish, Welsh or English.</li></ul> |  |

{23}------------------------------------------------

**There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because learners need to use cognates and previous knowledge to understand the text. They also need to ask probing questions to aid their analysis of the text.**

**Below are some examples of how Critical Thinking and Problem Solving can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

# *Example*

Teachers may wish to use Bloom's Taxonomy to develop critical thinking skills:

# Critical Thinking and Problem Solving

| Remember   | Describe el personaje principal.                     |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Understand | Explica porque el niño tiene que salir de su pueblo. |
| Apply      | Haz un mapa del cuento.                              |
| Analyse    | Compara España con el país del Galés.                |
| Evaluate | ¿Cómo te sentirías si tu estuviera en el cuento? |
| Create     | Haz un personaje nuevo para el cuento.               |

- Bloom's Taxonomy could also be used for key words to encourage learners to ask questions about the text. These could be done in English.
- Learners will also use problem solving when studying the text as they will need to use cognates, previous knowledge, context and any visual clues to identify the meaning of what they read.

{24}------------------------------------------------

| Planning and Organisation | There are many opportunities to include Planning and Organisation in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because learners need to prepare for the NEA. Below are some examples of how Planning and Organisation can be embedded into teaching and learning: Example <ul><li>Co-create a plan with learners as to when they should have read the text and completed their preparation for the NEA.</li><li>Check in with learners regularly to ensure they are meeting their deadlines and, if necessary, provide them with support to ensure the complete their work on time.</li></ul> |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Personal Effectiveness | There are many opportunities to include Personal Effectiveness in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because by reading the texts, learners will develop empathy and consider different points of view. Below are some examples of how Personal Effectiveness can be embedded into teaching and learning: |
|  | Example <ul><li>Teachers may wish to use the task to facilitate a class debate on something identified in the text. For example, if learners are studying 'Esperando la Carroza' give different learners or groups of learners one of the children to identify with. They then need to come up with their argument as to why Mamá Cora shouldn't live with them. This discussion could happen in English. However, learners could summarise the main points in Spanish and they could also write about how they think Mamá Cora would feel.</li></ul> |
