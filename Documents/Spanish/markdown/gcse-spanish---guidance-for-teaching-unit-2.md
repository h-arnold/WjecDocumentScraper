{12}------------------------------------------------

Learners will be required to:

- study a work in Spanish
- demonstrate their understanding of the work by responding in Spanish to a task set in Cymraeg/English.

Teachers could set written tasks based on a chosen text of both 70 and 130 words. Learners could be asked to summarise the text or write about the main events. Ask learners to give opinions on the text, for example their favourite part, their favourite character, their least favourite character, what they enjoyed and what they didn't enjoy about the text.

Ensure learners have plenty of opportunities to write 70 words in 20 minutes focusing on the plot, main events, favourite characters, opinions on setting, etc.

Ensure learners have plenty of opportunities to write 130 words in 40 minutes in which they note the main events, say what they liked/ disliked and why, provide examples, say if they would recommend the text, say what they would like to read next, etc. Ensure learners have opportunities to write both 70 words and 130 words with a one hour time limit.

Learners should be provided with opportunities to justify their opinions.

Ensure learners have the vocabulary to talk about the plot, characters and setting of text (time and place). Teachers may wish to challenge the more able learners by encouraging them to write about the main themes of the text or a lesson that they learnt from studying it.

A table could be created such as the one below:

| Name of<br>character | Description<br>(physical and<br>personality)                                                                          | What they do/<br>role in text.                                                                                                       | Things I like<br>about this<br>character and<br>why.                                                             | Things I dislike<br>about this<br>character and<br>why.                                                        |

For setting (location) learners could look at countries, places in the town, description of places and weather.

For the setting (times) learners could look at time phrases, dates and days.

For main events learners could focus on food, sports, activities, transport, leisure and routine.

Consider providing opportunities to discuss the following questions:

- Can you briefly explain what happens?
- Can you describe the key characters/ events/locations?
- What did you like? Why? Can you provide a specific example?
- What didn't you like? Why? Can you provide a specific example?
- What was your favourite character/moment/setting? Why? Can you give an example?
- What was your least favourite character/moment/setting? Why? Can you give a specific example?
- Would you recommend this book/film to a friend/family member? Why/why not?
- Are there any similarities between your experience/home/country/culture/interests and those in the chosen text? What example can you give?
- Are there any differences between your experience/home/country/culture/interests and those in the chosen text? What example can you give?
- What films/books has your chosen text inspired you to watch/read?
- What do you plan to watch/read next and why?

{14}------------------------------------------------

• What do you think will happen to the characters after the ending? For question 1b, learners will have to give examples. As such, teachers should encourage learners to give examples as well as justification. Teachers may wish to use an acronym such as ORE (Opinion, Reason, Example). An example of this could be: me fascina Inés puesto que ella es muy independiente, por ejemplo, cuando decide ir a América Látina.

making appropriate connections with other parts of the curriculum to develop and deepen learners' bilingual and multilingual skills

Learners will be encouraged to make connections with other parts of the curriculum throughout their learning of Spanish, especially in Unit 2, with cross-curricular connections to humanities subjects and of course with the other languages within the LLC Area of Learning Experience.

Unit 2 will allow learners to make connections with different parts of the curriculum. For example, they may learn about the historical, religious and social context in which the text is set. They may also learn about important cultural traditions such as food, dress and festivals.

# Opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales

# **Curriculum for Wales Strands**

#### **Cross-cutting Themes**

**There are many opportunities to include Local, National & International Contexts in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they allow them to make comparisons between a Spanish-speaking country or countries and Wales.**

Below are some examples of how Local, National & International Contexts can be embedded into teaching and learning:

# <span id="page-17-0"></span>Local, National & International Contexts

#### *Example*

- This topic will allow learners to make comparisons between life in Wales and life in Spanish-speaking countries.
- Teachers could create a Venn diagram which allows learners to identify similarities and differences between life in Wales and life in the Spanish-speaking country.
- You may wish to focus on and compare the place where the text is set with the place where your learners live.
- If the text includes LGBTQ+ people, learners could research and compare what it is like to be a LGBTQ+ young person in Wales compared to a Spanish-speaking country.

# **Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy**

Understanding the number system helps us to represent and compare relationships between numbers and quantities

**There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they can use numeracy to compare life in Wales with life in a Spanish speaking country by analysing data and graphs.**

**Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

# *Example*

- Find a recipe from the country where the text is set.
- Give learners a realistic budget and ask them to shop online for the ingredients for a certain number of people They could look at 'El Corte Inglés' website, for example.
- Find some graphs showing data on the country where the text is set. Learners could look at population, age, religion and ethnicity. Find similar graphs for Wales and ask learners to identify any key findings.

# **Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competence**

**There are many opportunities to include Digital Competency in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because this task needs to be submitted digitally and so it is essential that learners' digital skills are developed.**

**Below are some examples of how Digital Competency can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### *Example*

#### Citizenship

- Identify any stereotypes portrayed in the text and discuss why these can be harmful. If there are not any stereotypes, consider finding a newspaper article or cartoon that does portray stereotypes, for example about the role of women and compare how this differs to the text.
- Teachers may also highlight that stereotypes differ across cultures.
- If the text includes people using phones and social media, this could provide a springboard into discussing the positives and negatives of social media and how we can keep ourselves safe online.
- As part of this topic, learners may read online about other peoples' interpretations of the text. Teachers can use this as an opportunity to teach learners how to cite correctly. Or if they include any images in a

**There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because learners need to use cognates and previous knowledge to understand the text. They also need to ask probing questions to aid their analysis of the text.**

**Below are some examples of how Critical Thinking and Problem Solving can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

# *Example*

Teachers may wish to use Bloom's Taxonomy to develop critical thinking skills:

# Critical Thinking and Problem Solving

| Remember   | Describe el personaje principal.                     |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Understand | Explica porque el niño tiene que salir de su pueblo. |
| Apply      | Haz un mapa del cuento.                              |
| Analyse    | Compara España con el país del Galés.                |
| Evaluate   | ¿Cómo te sentirías si tu<br>estuviera en el cuento?  |
| Create     | Haz un personaje nuevo para el cuento.               |

- Bloom's Taxonomy could also be used for key words to encourage learners to ask questions about the text. These could be done in English.
- Learners will also use problem solving when studying the text as they will need to use cognates, previous knowledge, context and any visual clues to identify the meaning of what they read.

| Planning and<br>Organisation | There are many opportunities to include Planning and Organisation in GCSE Spanish. These<br>opportunities are important to Learners because<br>learners need to prepare for the NEA.<br>Below are some examples of how Planning and Organisation can be embedded into teaching<br>and learning:<br>Example<br>•<br>Co-create a plan with learners as to when they should have read the text and completed their<br>preparation for the NEA.<br>•<br>Check in with learners regularly to ensure they are meeting their deadlines and,<br>if necessary, provide<br>them with support to ensure the complete their work on time. |

| Personal Effectiveness       | There are many opportunities to include Personal Effectiveness in GCSE Spanish. These<br>opportunities are important to Learners because<br>by reading the texts, learners will develop<br>empathy and consider different points of view.<br>Below are some examples of how Personal Effectiveness can be embedded into teaching and<br>learning:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|                              | Example<br>•<br>Teachers<br>may wish to use the task to facilitate a class debate on something identified in the text. For<br>example, if learners<br>are studying 'Esperando la Carroza'<br>give different learners or groups of learners<br>one of the children to identify with. They then need to come up with their argument as to why Mamá<br>Cora shouldn't live with them. This discussion could happen in English. However, learners could<br>summarise the main points in Spanish and they could also write about how they think Mamá Cora<br>would feel.                                                           |
