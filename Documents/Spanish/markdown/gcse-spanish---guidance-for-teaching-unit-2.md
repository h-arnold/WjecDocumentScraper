Unit 2 Teacher Guidance

Reading and writing

Content Amplification

Teacher Guidance

Reading
and
Writing:

Learners should be able to:
•  understand and respond to written

language

Teachers may wish to begin by providing learners with an overview of the text in Cymraeg/
English or Spanish. This will enable learners to familiarise themselves with the main events
and characters.

•  use their knowledge of grammar and

vocabulary to support their
understanding of the work

•  use a variety of language patterns and

different verb tenses effectively

•  use complex structures where

appropriate

•  select relevant vocabulary and

grammar to express meaning

•  express themselves in written Spanish
to demonstrate their understanding,
ideas and opinions.

Classes could also watch a film with the English subtitles or read a dual language version of
the text. Remember that this is not a translation task so learners will not be expected to
translate the text into English. The focus is on learners responding to something that they
have read in Spanish.

Focus could be on key parts of the transcript or text. Teachers should encourage learners to
use previous knowledge and cognates to work out the gist of what they are reading.
Teachers may choose a particular part of the text to focus on grammatical understanding,
for example looking at the past tense.

The part of the transcript or text that is the focus could provide learners with vocabulary for
the three themes. For example, if there is a scene in which people are eating, this can be
used as a springboard to learn or revise food vocabulary.
Teachers should encourage learners to build up a bank of key words from the text and
regularly test them on these.

Provide tasks which allow learners to practise a range of tenses, for example what
happened in the text, what they like about the text and what they would like to read in the
future.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd 2025.

 GCSE Spanish Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 8

Learners will be required to:
•  study a work in Spanish
•  demonstrate their understanding of the
work by responding in Spanish to a
task set in Cymraeg/English.

Teachers could set written tasks based on a chosen text of both 70 and 130 words.
Learners could be asked to summarise the text or write about the main events. Ask learners
to give opinions on the text, for example their favourite part, their favourite character, their
least favourite character, what they enjoyed and what they didn’t enjoy about the text.

Ensure learners have plenty of opportunities to write 70 words in 20 minutes focusing on the
plot, main events, favourite characters, opinions on setting, etc.

Ensure learners have plenty of opportunities to write 130 words in 40 minutes in which they
note the main events, say what they liked/ disliked and why, provide examples, say if they
would recommend the text, say what they would like to read next, etc.
Ensure learners have opportunities to write both 70 words and 130 words with a one hour
time limit.

Learners should be provided with opportunities to justify their opinions.

Ensure learners have the vocabulary to talk about the plot, characters and setting of text
(time and place). Teachers may wish to challenge the more able learners by encouraging
them to write about the main themes of the text or a lesson that they learnt from studying it.

A table could be created such as the one below:

Name of
character

Description
(physical and
personality)

What they do/
role in text.

Things I like
about this
character and
why.

Things I dislike
about this

For setting (location) learners could look at countries, places in the town, description of
places and weather.

For the setting (times) learners could look at time phrases, dates and days.

For main events learners could focus on food, sports, activities, transport, leisure and
routine.

Consider providing opportunities to discuss the following questions:
•  Can you briefly explain what happens?
•  Can you describe the key characters/ events/locations?
•  What did you like? Why? Can you provide a specific example?
•  What didn’t you like? Why? Can you provide a specific example?
•  What was your favourite character/moment/setting? Why? Can you give an example?
•  What was your least favourite character/moment/setting? Why? Can you give a specific

example?

•  Would you recommend this book/film to a friend/family member? Why/why not?
•  Are there any similarities between your experience/home/country/culture/interests and

those in the chosen text? What example can you give?

•  Are there any differences between your experience/home/country/culture/interests and

those in the chosen text? What example can you give?

•  What films/books has your chosen text inspired you to watch/read?
•  What do you plan to watch/read next and why?

© WJEC CBAC Ltd 2025.

 GCSE Spanish Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 10

•  What do you think will happen to the characters after the ending?

For question 1b, learners will have to give examples. As such, teachers should encourage
learners to give examples as well as justification. Teachers may wish to use an acronym
such as ORE (Opinion, Reason, Example).

An example of this could be: me fascina Inés puesto que ella es muy independiente, por
ejemplo, cuando decide ir a América Látina.

Learning Experiences

Learners should be encouraged to consider the following learning experiences and skills to
further develop their understanding, appreciation and awareness of the subject content.
Information in the table below provides opportunities for teachers to integrate the learning
experiences into delivery.

Learning Experience

Exemplification of Learning Experience

learn about the culture and
society in the countries and
communities where the
international language is
spoken

explore the cross-cutting
themes of human rights and
diversity, including Black,
Asian and minority ethnic
perspectives, identity, culture
and contributions

The purpose of Unit 2 is to allow learners to demonstrate their
awareness of the culture and society of the countries and
communities where Spanish is spoken and make connections
with their own languages and culture.

Unit 2 will provide learners with opportunities to develop their
cultural knowledges and understanding of the Sanish-speaking
world. The suggested texts come from across the Spanish-
speaking world to highlight the complexity and variety of the
cultures they represent. This will allow learners to draw
comparisons between their lives and the lives of Spanish-
speakers from across the globe. It will also enable them to
compare and contrast Welsh culture with the culture of the
Spanish-speaking country.

Centres are free to choose their work for Unit 2. Works may
focus on the cross-cutting themes of human rights and diversity
including Black, Asian and minority ethnic perspectives,
identity, culture and contributions but this is not compulsory.

All the suggested texts highlight opportunities to explore the
cross-cutting themes. When looking at human rights, centres
may find it useful to consult the United Nations Rights of the
Child https://www.unicef.es/causas/derechos-ninos.

Many of the characters within the suggested texts are from
Black, Asian or ethnic minorities. This allows learners to
engage with the lived experiences of people from different
communities in an authentic manner.

This unit allows centres to explore the impact of colonisation on
the Spanish-speaking world and indigenous communities.
Learners can then draw links between Spanish and British
colonisation and the long-term effects of both.

have direct or indirect contact
with speakers of the language

Centres and learners will be able to use initiatives such as MFL
Mentoring – Modern Foreign Languages and Llwybrau at
Ieithoedd Cymru Routes into Languages Cymru.

Both schemes support international languages and
multilingualism in the new curriculum for Wales. Centres can
request visits from Mentors and Student Language
Ambassadors and sessions can be in person or online.

 GCSE Spanish Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 12

Centres can also apply for funding via Taith - Hwb (gov.wales)
to take part in educational international exchanges.

By reading or watching a text in Spanish, learners can have
direct contact with speakers of the language.

To support context, centres can show learners videos in
Spanish about the country or region that the text is set in.

Centres may wish to use the British Council to develop links
with a school in the country where the text is set.

Learners will have the opportunity to engage with the language
from a variety of sources and in a variety of genres and media
throughout the specification.

Learners will be engaging with a text or film which allows them
to engage with language from different sources. To support
their understanding learners’ may also read fact files, watch
information videos or read about what daily life is like in the
country where the text is set.

Learners will have the opportunity to demonstrate language
strategies and language learning skills, including the use of
dictionaries throughout the specification.

Learning strategies will need to be taught for learners to
decode the key messages in the texts.

Learners will need to be language detectives and use
cognates, previous knowledge and context to understand the
gist of what they read.

engage with the language

translanguaging

Learners will have the opportunity to use their translanguaging
skills, throughout the specification.

Translanguaging is an important element of this unit. Learners
may read their chosen text in Cymraeg/English and Spanish.
Similarly, they may watch the film in Spanish with
English/Welsh subtitles.

When learners are researching their text and the cultural
context, they may find information in Spanish and
Cymraeg/English.

make use of digital technology   Learners will have the opportunity to make use of digital

technology in all units. They may word process their responses
for Unit 2 but this is not compulsory.

Learners may use digital technology to research the text or the
culture and history of the country where it is set.

Learners may also use digital technology to collate their
research and re-write it in their own words.

making appropriate
connections with other parts
of the curriculum to develop
and deepen learners’ bilingual
and multilingual skills

Learners will be encouraged to make connections with other
parts of the curriculum throughout their learning of Spanish,
especially in Unit 2, with cross-curricular connections to
humanities subjects and of course with the other languages
within the LLC Area of Learning Experience.

Unit 2 will allow learners to make connections with different
parts of the curriculum. For example, they may learn about the
historical, religious and social context in which the text is set.
They may also learn about important cultural traditions such as
food, dress and festivals.

Opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales

Curriculum for Wales Strands

Cross-cutting Themes

Local, National &
International Contexts

There are many opportunities to include Local, National & International Contexts in GCSE Spanish.
These opportunities are important to Learners because they allow them to make comparisons
between a Spanish-speaking country or countries and Wales.

Below are some examples of how Local, National & International Contexts can be embedded into teaching
and learning:

Example

•  This topic will allow learners to make comparisons between life in Wales and life in Spanish-speaking

countries.

•  Teachers could create a Venn diagram which allows learners to identify similarities and differences

between life in Wales and life in the Spanish-speaking country.

•  You may wish to focus on and compare the place where the text is set with the place where your

•

learners live.
If the text includes LGBTQ+ people, learners could research and compare what it is like to be a
LGBTQ+ young person in Wales compared to a Spanish-speaking country.

 GCSE Spanish Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 15

There are many opportunities to include Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE)  in GCSE
Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they will be identifying
relationships in the text.

Below are some examples of how RSE can be embedded into teaching and learning:

Example

•  Teachers may wish to use the text as a springboard for talking about family, friendship or romantic

•

relationships.
If learners are reading a text with LGBTQ+ characters teachers may wish to look at Spanish gender-
neutral pronouns.

•  Teachers could use the text to note positive and negative relationships and the key characteristics of

these.

•  To develop empathy, ask learners to put themselves into the place of the characters and say how they

would feel/act: Si fuera Chava, me sentiría.

•  This is also an excellent opportunity to use more complex language.

There are many opportunities to include Human Rights Education and Diversity in GCSE Spanish.
These opportunities are important to Learners because the texts focus on different peoples’ lived
experiences.

Below are some examples of how Human Rights Education and Diversity can be embedded
into teaching and learning:

Example

•  Many of the suggested texts chosen are based in Latin America. As such, you may wish to provide
learners with the context of the colonisation of Latin America and the impact this had on indigenous
people. This could also be linked to the negative effects of the British Empire.

•  Furthermore, this topic allows teachers to highlight to learners that Spanish speakers come from many

different countries and ethnicities.

•  Encourage learners to note what other languages are spoken in the region that the text is set (Spain or

Latin America). This highlights to learners that we are diverse individuals who do not fit into one
category.

Relationships and
Sexuality Education

 GCSE Spanish Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 16

•  This topic is a fabulous opportunity to highlight the rich and diverse nature of the Spanish-speaking

world.
•
If centres choose a text which includes refugees, teachers may wish to look at the rights of refugees.
Many of the texts suggested focus on children and so teachers could look at the UNCRC (United Nations
Rights of a Child) and consider whether the children in the text are having their rights protected.
https://www.unicef.es/causas/derechos-ninos

There are many opportunities to include Career and Work-Related Experiences (CWRE) in GCSE
Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because this unit will challenge pupils to
engage with longer texts and use what they have learnt to develop their writing.

Below are some examples of how CWRE can be embedded into teaching and learning:

Careers and Work-
Related Experiences

Example

•  Encourage learners to use the bank of vocabulary and grammar that they have created to experiment

with language.

•  Note the occupations of any characters in the text. If there are any children and young people in the text
encourage learners to discuss what school or college looks like them for them. Compare it with school
and college in the UK.

 GCSE Spanish Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 17

Cross-curricular Skills - Literacy

There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are
important to Learners because this unit focuses on reading and writing.

Below are some examples of how Literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning:

Example

Reading

•  This is a reading task and so there will be many opportunities for learners to develop their reading skills.
Teachers may start by providing learners with the title page and ask them to predict what the text is
about.

•  As learners read the text encourage activities which require close reading for example gap-fills or match
up activities. Learners can practise skimming and scanning by finding key words or details in the text.

•  Encourage learners to use what they are reading to build up their vocabulary and their grammatical

understanding.

Example

Writing

•  Learners should practice writing 70 and 130 words about the text. Learners should have plenty of

opportunities to summarise the text and to give opinions and justifications.

•  Encourage learners to extend their language by including connectives, opinions and reasons.

 GCSE Spanish Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 18

Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy

Understanding the
number system helps
us to represent and
compare relationships
between numbers and
quantities

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are
important to Learners because they can use numeracy to compare life in Wales with life in a
Spanish speaking country by analysing data and graphs.

Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning:

Example

•  Find a recipe from the country where the text is set.
•  Give learners a realistic budget and ask them to shop online for the ingredients for a certain number of

people They could look at ‘El Corte Inglés’ website, for example.

•  Find some graphs showing data on the country where the text is set. Learners could look at population,
age, religion and ethnicity. Find similar graphs for Wales and ask learners to identify any key findings.

Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competence

There are many opportunities to include Digital Competency in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities
are important to Learners because this task needs to be submitted digitally and so it is essential
that learners’ digital skills are developed.

Below are some examples of how Digital Competency can be embedded into teaching and
learning:

Example

•

Identify any stereotypes portrayed in the text and discuss why these can be harmful. If there are not any
stereotypes, consider finding a newspaper article or cartoon that does portray stereotypes, for example
about the role of women and compare how this differs to the text.
•  Teachers may also highlight that stereotypes differ across cultures.
•

If the text includes people using phones and social media, this could provide a springboard into
discussing the positives and negatives of social media and how we can keep ourselves safe online.
•  As part of this topic, learners may read online about other peoples’ interpretations of the text. Teachers
can use this as an opportunity to teach learners how to cite correctly. Or if they include any images in a

Citizenship

 GCSE Spanish Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 19

resource that they create, teach them how to cite where the image has come from and whether it is a
reliable source of information.

Example

Producing

•  Use Canva or a similar programme to create a new front cover of the text or film.
•  Learners could use Google Sites or a similar programme to create a website with key information

about the text alongside a country profile.

Integral Skills

There are many opportunities to include Creativity and Innovation in GCSE Spanish. These
opportunities are important to Learners because learners will be inspired by the literature that they
engage with and this will act as a springboard for their own creative development.

Creativity and
Innovation

Below are some examples of how Creativity and Innovation can be embedded into teaching
and learning:

Example

•  Teachers could ask learners to write an alternative ending or create an additional character.
•  Learners may wish to use the text as inspiration to write their own story in Spanish, Welsh or English.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd 2025.

 GCSE Spanish Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 20

There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE Spanish.
These opportunities are important to Learners because learners need to use cognates and previous
knowledge to understand the text. They also need to ask probing questions to aid their analysis of
the text.

Below are some examples of how Critical Thinking and Problem Solving can be embedded into
teaching and learning:

Example

Teachers may wish to use Bloom’s Taxonomy to develop critical thinking skills:

Critical Thinking and
Problem Solving

Remember

Understand

Apply

Analyse

Evaluate

Create

Describe el personaje principal.

Explica porque el niño tiene que salir de su pueblo.

Haz un mapa del cuento.

Compara España con el país del Galés.

¿Cómo te sentirías si tu estuviera en el cuento?

Haz un personaje nuevo para el cuento.

•  Bloom’s Taxonomy could also be used for key words to encourage learners to ask questions about the

text. These could be done in English.

•  Learners will also use problem solving when studying the text as they will need to use cognates,
previous knowledge, context and any visual clues to identify the meaning of what they read.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd 2025.

 GCSE Spanish Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 21

Planning and
Organisation

There are many opportunities to include Planning and Organisation in GCSE Spanish. These
opportunities are important to Learners because learners need to prepare for the NEA.

Below are some examples of how Planning and Organisation can be embedded into teaching
and learning:

Example

•  Co-create a plan with learners as to when they should have read the text and completed their

preparation for the NEA.

•  Check in with learners regularly to ensure they are meeting their deadlines and, if necessary, provide

them with support to ensure the complete their work on time.

There are many opportunities to include Personal Effectiveness in GCSE Spanish. These
opportunities are important to Learners because by reading the texts, learners will develop
empathy and consider different points of view.

Below are some examples of how Personal Effectiveness can be embedded into teaching and
learning:

Personal Effectiveness

Example

•  Teachers may wish to use the task to facilitate a class debate on something identified in the text. For
example, if learners are studying ‘Esperando la Carroza’ give different learners or groups of learners
one of the children to identify with. They then need to come up with their argument as to why Mamá
Cora shouldn’t live with them. This discussion could happen in English. However, learners could
summarise the main points in Spanish and they could also write about how they think Mamá Cora
would feel.
