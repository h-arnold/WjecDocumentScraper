{9}------------------------------------------------

#### Assessment details

#### **Unit 1 – Oracy**

The assessment lasts for 7–10 minutes

Preparation time: 10 minutes

30% of qualification

60 marks

This unit requires candidates to speak using clear and comprehensible Spanish to:

- read aloud a short sentence and participate in a role play
- give a presentation, prepared in advance, based on their own interest and take part in a short unprepared discussion relating to the presentation
- take part in a short unprepared conversation.

The rubrics and stimuli will all be in Cymraeg/English (except for the read aloud task). The language of response will be in the assessed language.

**Candidates are not permitted to use a dictionary in any part of the assessment. The assessment must be submitted digitally.**

# **Task 1: Read aloud and role play**

Candidates can make notes on one-side of A4 paper for the read aloud and role play during the preparation time (the notes will not be marked as part of the assessment).

#### **Task 1a: The read aloud**

**The candidate will begin by reading aloud the short sentence in Spanish to demonstrate their understanding of sound-spelling correspondence.**

#### **Task 1b: The role play**

The role play contains **four** interactions. The teacher will start the role play, they are not required to read out the scenario to the candidate and **must not** rephrase the prompts. Candidates may refer to notes to support them with the read aloud and the role play which must be given to the teacher immediately after the assessment.

During the role play, candidates will:

- respond appropriately to questions or statements as prompted by the bullet points on the role play card
- formulate a question.

Candidates should be able to demonstrate their understanding of the assessed language through their responses in a range of different settings to include the following:

- train/bus station
- tourist information office
- cinema/theatre/venue
- campsite/hostel/hotel
- pharmacy/doctor's surgery/hospital
- leisure centre
- shops
- café/restaurant
- in the home
- in town.

{10}------------------------------------------------

Candidates should be able to engage in transactions including asking and answering questions, asking for advice, making a complaint, reporting a problem, explaining, describing, giving reasons and expressing opinions. The scenario will provide candidates with guidance and prompts in Cymraeg/English on the responses that are required.

**Total time for read aloud and role play: 2 minutes**

**Total marks: 11**

**(AO2 – 8 marks) (AO3 – 3 marks)**

# **Task 2: Presentation and Discussion**

#### **Task 2a**

Candidates will:

- give an oral presentation in which they communicate information, describe and narrate events. The presentation may be prepared two weeks in advance of the first timetabled assessment. The presentation can be on a subject of the learner's choosing which falls within **one** of the following **three** broad themes:
  - theme 1: language for leisure and wellbeing
  - theme 2: language for travel
  - theme 3: language for work and study.

**Marks: (AO1 – 6 marks) (AO3 – 3 marks)**

Candidates may prepare their presentation two weeks prior to the first timetabled assessment.

Candidates are not permitted to use a dictionary in the preparation of their presentation. Candidates may refer to prepared bullet points to support them with the delivery of their presentation (max. 30 words), complete and continuous sentences are not permitted. The bullet points must be given to the teacher immediately after the presentation (the bullet points will not be marked as part of the assessment).

#### **Task 2b**

Candidates will:

- take part in an unprepared discussion relating to the presentation in the present, past and future tenses. Teachers will lead the discussion by asking questions relating to the presentation. The teacher may repeat or rephrase questions that the candidate does not understand.
- Teachers should provide opportunities for candidates to:
  - give clear responses to the questions they are asked (AO1)
  - use a variety of vocabulary, grammatical structures and different timeframes accurately (AO3).

Candidates may refer to prepared bullet points [max 30 words], to support them with the delivery of their presentation. The bullet points must be given to the teacher immediately after the presentation.

Examples of topics for the presentation are included in the Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching document.

**Marks: (AO1 – 10 marks) (AO3 – 5 marks)**

The presentation should last **no longer than 1 minute.**

The discussion should last between **2-3 minutes.**

{11}------------------------------------------------

**Total time for presentation and discussion: 3-4 minutes. Total marks for presentation and discussion: 24 marks (AO1 – 16 marks) (AO3 – 8 marks)**

#### **Task 3: Conversation**

Candidates will contribute to a conversation based on one of the 3 broad themes. The conversation should be based on a different broad theme to the one chosen for the presentation. Teachers must inform candidates of the allocated broad theme for the conversation at the start of the 10 minutes preparation time. The conversation should be based on the broad theme that has not been covered in the presentation and the role play, so that all three broad themes are covered in the Unit 1 NEA. Candidates can make notes on one-side of A4 paper on the theme of the conversation during the preparation time (the notes will not be marked as part of the assessment).

The purpose of this element of the task is to encourage the candidate to demonstrate what language they know. In order to do this, teachers should provide opportunities for candidates to:

- give clear responses to the questions they are asked (AO1)
- develop their responses as far as they are able (AO1)
- express ideas and opinions
- use a variety of vocabulary, grammatical structures and different timeframes accurately (AO3).

Candidates may refer to notes made on the theme of the conversation during the preparation time which must be given to the teacher immediately after the assessment.

#### Questioning technique:

- Teachers should avoid asking prepared questions and should instead build a conversation based on individual candidate responses.
- Questions should ideally be succinct so that there is less teacher talk and more candidate talk.
- Closed questions, which generally lead to yes/no answers, should be followed-up with an opportunity to express opinions or give more information (prompted, for example, by '¿*Por qué*?' or ¿*Por qué no*?').
- Where possible, more open questions should be used in order to allow the candidate to offer more information/more developed responses.
- Useful question openers for extended answers could be '*Háblame de*…', '*Describe tu/s*…' or ¿ '*Qué piensas de*…?' for example.

**Total time for conversation: 2-4 minutes Total marks: 25 (AO1 – 20 marks) (AO3 – 5 marks)**

Teachers should tailor the complexity of the questions to the ability of the candidate. Questions may be repeated or rephrased during this part of the task. The teacher should use their judgement as to when to move on if a candidate does not understand or respond to a question even after rephrasing. In order to sustain conversation and avoid long silences, it is better to move to a different question to encourage the candidate to keep talking. Candidates should be given the opportunity to respond in the present, past and future tenses. Candidates may refer to notes to support them with the theme of the conversation which must be given to the teacher immediately after the assessment.

{12}------------------------------------------------

When asking questions Teachers should use the different areas of the broad theme as well as the candidate's interests and experiences to continue the conversation. Candidates should be given the opportunity to respond in the present, past and future tenses.

#### **Allocation of Role play cards:**

The allocation of cards for the role play will be generated by the candidate's choice of broad theme for the presentation.

If the candidate's choice of presentations is from Theme 1, they must be allocated a role play from Theme 2. If the candidate's choice of presentations is from Theme 2, they must be allocated a role play from Theme 1. If the candidate's choice of presentations is from Theme 3, they may be allocated a role play from either Theme 1 or Theme 2.

There will be six role plays for Theme 1 and six role plays for Theme 2.

The first candidate must be given either card 1a or card 2a, depending on their choice of presentation. The second candidate must be given the prescribed card from the next row (depending on their choice of presentation), this sequence will continue for each teacher (not by the centre as a whole). After breaks in testing (including lunchtime and overnight) the sequence should continue. For example, if candidate 3 is tested before a break, the next candidate will be candidate 4. Teachers must follow this prescribed order.

| Candidate<br>Order | Theme 1<br>Presentation | Theme 2<br>Presentation | Theme 3<br>Presentation |
|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1                  | 2a                      | 1a                      | 1a                      |

| 6                  | 2f                      | 1f                      | 2f                      |
| 7                  | 2d                      | 1d                      | 2f                      |
| 8                  | 2a                      | 1f                      | 1b                      |
| 9                  | 2b                      | 1a                      | 2c                      |
| 10                 | 2e                      | 1e                      | 1d                      |
| 11                 | 2f                      | 1c                      | 2e                      |
| 12                 | 2c                      | 1b                      | 1a                      |

The allocation of role plays is designed to ensure that the assessment experienced by each candidate samples a range of vocabulary from the vocabulary list.

Please note the allocation order will change each year.

{13}------------------------------------------------

# **Task setting**

Tasks are set by WJEC. The assessment will be carried out by teachers at the centre, audio recorded and marked by external examiners. The role play cards will be sent to the Examinations Officer at the centre in a secure pack. Each centre will receive two packs. There will be instructions not to open the package until the specified date. Each candidate will be allocated one card. The list allocating the card to each candidate is shown above. The teacher must ensure that each candidate is assessed with the correct card. Teacher prompts for the role play, and guidance on setting questions for the discussion and conversation are provided below. The Teacher may open the packs up to three working days in advance of the first assessment date at the centre.

Centres must keep a record of the schedule (including dates) on which the assessments are conducted on the declaration form below. This form is for the centre and candidates to sign and declare that assessments have been conducted according to the requirements in the Assessment Pack and this must be submitted to WJEC with the audio recordings. Audio files should be uploaded to the WJEC Portal within 48 hours or two working days of the speaking assessments taking place.

#### **Task taking**

Each candidate will have a preparation time of ten minutes prior to the commencement of the assessment. This preparation time must be supervised by an exam invigilator organised by the centre and who is not a subject specialist.

Candidates are not permitted to use dictionaries in any part of the assessment, including the preparation time.

Candidates are advised to spend their 10 minutes preparation time, practising the readaloud sub-vocally, making notes on what to say in the role play and conversation and of course, practising their presentation.

The candidate may bring prepared bullet points [maximum 30 words] to support with the delivery of the presentation into the assessment. During the preparation time, the candidate may, if they wish, make notes on the read aloud and role play, and the allocated theme of the conversation on one-side of A4 paper and refer to these during the assessment. The teacher must check the notes prior to the commencement of the assessment and remove the bullet points from the candidate if they contain complete and continuous sentences. Otherwise, the notes must be handed to the teacher at the end of the test, along with the role play. After the preparation period of 10 minutes, the teacher must ensure that the candidate spends the following times on each task:

#### **Approximate timings for oral assessment**

| Task                        | Approximate timings      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Role play                   | 2 minutes                |
| Presentation and discussion | 1 minute and 2-3 minutes |
| Conversation                | 2-4 minutes              |

The timing for the read aloud and role play is approximately 2 minutes but this will depend on each candidate. The timing for the presentation, discussion and conversation should be adhered to so that the candidate is able to access the full range of marks. The overall

{14}------------------------------------------------

timings must be adhered to and any speaking evidence that exceeds these timings will not be marked.

#### **Conducting the assessment**

Candidates will be allowed one attempt at the assessment. Once the recording begins it cannot be paused or stopped until the end of the assessment. The only circumstances in which a candidate can be re-tested are if there is a technical malfunction during the assessment (so that, for example, the assessment has not been recorded or is inaudible) or an incident occurs beyond the teacher's control which prevents the completion of the assessment. In any such circumstance, the teacher must inform WJEC immediately via the Examinations Officer at the centre. WJEC will then inform the centre which role play to use in place of the original allocation.

Detailed instructions regarding the process for submitting the materials will be communicated to centres through Examination Officers.

When introducing each candidate, the following convention must be used: Specification/centre number/candidate number/candidate name/role play card/ presentation theme/conversation theme/date.

Learners<br>would benefit from access to<br>a reference list of common sound-spelling correspondence rules to<br>which they could refer as they read aloud,<br>for example when working in<br>pairs, so that they can reflect upon and improve each other's<br>pronunciation. A variety of activities which would support learners to<br>consider sound-spelling correspondence include listening to songs,<br>video clips<br>and completing gap-fill activities, or the teacher<br>mispronouncing words that learners are reading and asking learners to<br>spot the mistake. |  |

{17}------------------------------------------------

Ensure learners are familiar with question words in Spanish and are able to formulate questions themselves. Activities such as matching questions and answers in Spanish, providing an answer and asking the learners to formulate the question, 'what am I?' and 'guess who?' can help develop proficiency.

Ensure learners understand the 'tú' and 'usted' form of verbs to support them in responding to role play tasks and that they have the opportunity to practise using these in role play phrases and questions. Tasks where learners choose the right form based on the person and situation may be useful e.g. responding to the headteacher, a friend, an elderly neighbour. Practise manipulating common verbs into present, past and future tenses, through starter activities such as drilling verb endings, re ordering sentences and choosing the correct verb to complete a sentence. Ensure learners can recognise time markers in past, present and future tenses, through approaches such as categorising, word banks and gap -fill exercises.

Support pupils to develop a bank of useful opinions and complex phrases which they are confident in using, through including these in starter tasks , for example categorise the phrase into sentence starter/opinion/reason and consider creating cross topic knowledge organisers from which learners can select a range of phrases. Encourage pupils to include a range of opinions, reasons and complex phrases, with different tenses , in every task where they produce Spanish so that they become confident in this, knowledge organisers or similar can support them with selecting these appropriately. This can be practised by regularly asking pupils to formulate opinions and reasons on different topics, either as a mini plenary using whiteboards or as a longer task in pairs /groups. 'Speed dating' where learners ask several other learners for responses and react to these may be helpful.

{18}------------------------------------------------

Learners should be able to demonstrate their understanding of Spanish through their responses in a range of different settings to include the following:

- train / bus station
- tourist information office
- cinema / theatre / venue
- campsite / hostel / hotel
- pharmacy / doctor's surgery / hospital
- leisure centre
- shops
- café / restaurant
- in the home
- in town.

Practise the key vocabulary that will be needed for role play tasks in these settings.

There are multiple ways of teaching and learning vocabulary. Activities where learners test themselves or each other can work well in consolidating recall. Learners can test each other from the vocabulary lists provided by WJEC, you may wish to make card games or sets from these with which learners can test each other in pairs or groups Teachers may also find apps helpful for learners to learn and test themselves. ['Memrise'](https://www.memrise.com/) or ['Quizlet'](https://quizlet.com/gb) and online activities such as ['Kahoot'](https://kahoot.it/) and ['Blooket'](https://www.blooket.com/) can be useful as revision, home learning and class activities.

Learners should be able to engage in transactions including:

- asking and responding to questions
- asking for advice
- making a complaint
- reporting a problem
- explaining, describing and giving reasons
- expressing opinions.

Learners will be required to:

- participate in a role play
- give a presentation, prepared in advance, based on their own interest and take part in a short unprepared discussion relating to the presentation
- take part in a short unprepared conversation.

Learn and practise useful sentence starters and verbs. Activities where the sentence is given but needs to be re-ordered can provide a model. Working in pairs and groups of learners can be helpful when practising these responses. Learners should be encouraged to consider what they can say in Spanish to meet the response as responses are usually not prescriptive, therefore many different answers can be acceptable providing the grammar is correct.

Teachers should ensure that learners are familiar with the mark scheme and that during the role play, they do not extend answers but instead focus on an accurate and suitable response with a verb for each response which they formulate. Regularly practising a role play phrase as a starter activity can be helpful, as can asking learners to formulate a response and display it on a mini whiteboard before discussing the appropriate responses as a class. This approach can also be used with forming the question. Encourage learners to be a 'detective' and decide what the instruction is asking them for e.g. a past tense verb. Learners could write and test/perform for each other in role plays.

{19}------------------------------------------------

Lea rners should be encouraged to develop extended sentences in the presentation and to practise the pronunciation of their planned presentation. They should aim to attempt extended answers to the discussion questions in order to develop their responses.

Learners should have regular opportunities to present to others in a range of contexts. You may wish to begin with learners presenting a few sentences on a subject that they have researched, providing sentence starters as a guide. Initially, this could be carried out in pairs/groups and with visual support such as a PowerPoint or Sway. Presentations could also be encouraged in the style of a podcast or guide on aspects such as a region or cultural practice of Spain or a Spanish speaking country. In preparation for delivering their presentation NEA, learners should also have regular practi se devising bullet points to support their presentations.

You may wish to take an example presentation and discuss explicitly with the class what the key points are that would formulate the bullet points and how these would best help them to remember the structure of their work. Learners could then carry out this activity for other exemplar presentations before devising bullet points for their own work. · Mock NEA tasks can be helpful in allowing learners to practise this skill under NEA conditions.

Learners become accustomed to anticipating the sorts of questions that might be asked about their presentations. This could be done in groups or as a class activity. You could also encourage learners to formulate a follow -up question each to ask peers who are presenting to the class on different topics. As well as helping them to predict questions, this will also help develop learners' listening skills.

For the conversation, learners would benefit from confidence in using opinions, reasons, manipulating tenses and being able to ask a simple question of the teacher.

{20}------------------------------------------------

It is important to remind learners that the grammatical structures and vocabulary they learn across the three themes can be transferred and recycled in different contexts. Learners should be given regular opportunities to convey information, describe and narrate events across the three themes, and to develop their responses by providing opinions and reasons. Word banks/vocabulary mats can be useful to build familiarity, as can encouraging learners to create their own personalised lists of phrases in different tenses, with opinions, reasons and connectives which they develop and become familiar with over the course.

Discussion with learners around the preparation of questions for such activities would be part of preparation and it would be important to highlight that questions should be designed to allow learners to respond in different tenses and to develop and extend their answers as fully as possible with consideration of the strengths of the individual learner. It may be helpful to devise a bank of questions for learners across the three themes which include opportunities for expression in the past, present and future tenses and to give extended answers. However, this should not be exhaustive and should be adapted in the NEA to best support and stretch each individual learner. Tense work could also be practised, for example by asking learners to change a conversation about the future into the past by changing tenses and time markers. Learners could practise from the question bank using card prompts to generate quick fire responses to build confidence.

# **Cross-curricular Skills - Numeracy**

Understanding the number system helps us to represent and compare relationships between numbers and quantities **There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they will be able to understand and communicate numerical information in Spanish.**

**Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### *Example*

- Learners will be able to communicate using numbers, prices and times in Spanish, as well as quantities and sizes.
- Number games can be useful to reinforce this, such as bingo, 21s, as well as role play tasks involving numbers, quantities and sizes.

# **Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competency**

**There are many opportunities to include Digital Competency in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because they will be able to use these skills to practise their Spanish.**

**Below are some examples of how Digital Competency can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

Interacting and Collaborating

#### *Example*

- Learners could use digital skills to research information for their presentation task. They may also wish to use audio and recording software to practise and record themselves to develop pronunciation and intonation and present this to each other to practise.
- If the opportunity to interview a native speaker, take part in a virtual exchange or speak with a student languages ambassador arises, then use of video conferencing applications would be of use in allowing real time communication.
