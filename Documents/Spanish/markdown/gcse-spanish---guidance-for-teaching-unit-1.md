Assessment details

Unit 1 – Oracy
The assessment lasts for 7–10 minutes
Preparation time: 10 minutes
30% of qualification
60 marks

This unit requires candidates to speak using clear and comprehensible Spanish to:
•
•  give a presentation, prepared in advance, based on their own interest and take part in

read aloud a short sentence and participate in a role play

a short unprepared discussion relating to the presentation
take part in a short unprepared conversation.

•

The rubrics and stimuli will all be in Cymraeg/English (except for the read aloud task). The
language of response will be in the assessed language.

Candidates are not permitted to use a dictionary in any part of the assessment.
The assessment must be submitted digitally.

Candidates can make notes on one-side of A4 paper for the read aloud and role play
during the preparation time (the notes will not be marked as part of the assessment).

Task 1a: The read aloud
The candidate will begin by reading aloud the short sentence in Spanish to
demonstrate their understanding of sound-spelling correspondence.

Task 1b: The role play
The role play contains four interactions. The teacher will start the role play, they are not
required to read out the scenario to the candidate and must not rephrase the prompts.
Candidates may refer to notes to support them with the read aloud and the role play which
must be given to the teacher immediately after the assessment.

During the role play, candidates will:
•

respond appropriately to questions or statements as prompted by the bullet points on
the role play card
formulate a question.

 GCSE Spanish Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 6

Candidates should be able to engage in transactions including asking and answering
questions, asking for advice, making a complaint, reporting a problem, explaining,
describing, giving reasons and expressing opinions. The scenario will provide candidates
with guidance and prompts in Cymraeg/English on the responses that are required.

Total time for read aloud and role play: 2 minutes
Total marks: 11
(AO2 – 8 marks) (AO3 – 3 marks)

Task 2: Presentation and Discussion

Task 2a
Candidates will:
•  give an oral presentation in which they communicate information, describe and narrate

events. The presentation may be prepared two weeks in advance of the first
timetabled assessment. The presentation can be on a subject of the learner’s
choosing which falls within one of the following three broad themes:
•
•
•

theme 1: language for leisure and wellbeing
theme 2: language for travel
theme 3: language for work and study.

Marks: (AO1 – 6 marks) (AO3 – 3 marks)

Candidates may prepare their presentation two weeks prior to the first timetabled
assessment.
Candidates are not permitted to use a dictionary in the preparation of their presentation.
Candidates may refer to prepared bullet points to support them with the delivery of their
presentation (max. 30 words), complete and continuous sentences are not permitted. The
bullet points must be given to the teacher immediately after the presentation (the bullet
points will not be marked as part of the assessment).

Candidates will:
•
and future tenses. Teachers will lead the discussion by asking questions relating to the
presentation. The teacher may repeat or rephrase questions that the candidate does not
understand.
•  Teachers should provide opportunities for candidates to:

•  give clear responses to the questions they are asked (AO1)
•  use a variety of vocabulary, grammatical structures and different timeframes

accurately (AO3).

Candidates may refer to prepared bullet points [max 30 words], to support them with the
delivery of their presentation. The bullet points must be given to the teacher immediately
after the presentation.

Examples of topics for the presentation are included in the Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching
document.

Marks: (AO1 – 10 marks) (AO3 – 5 marks)

The presentation should last no longer than 1 minute.
The discussion should last between 2-3 minutes.

 GCSE Spanish Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 7

Total time for presentation and discussion: 3-4 minutes.
Total marks for presentation and discussion: 24 marks
(AO1 – 16 marks) (AO3 – 8 marks)

Task 3: Conversation

Candidates will contribute to a conversation based on one of the 3 broad themes.
The conversation should be based on a different broad theme to the one chosen for the
presentation. Teachers must inform candidates of the allocated broad theme for the
conversation at the start of the 10 minutes preparation time. The conversation should be
based on the broad theme that has not been covered in the presentation and the role play,
so that all three broad themes are covered in the Unit 1 NEA. Candidates can make notes
on one-side of A4 paper on the theme of the conversation during the preparation time (the
notes will not be marked as part of the assessment).

The purpose of this element of the task is to encourage the candidate to demonstrate
what language they know. In order to do this, teachers should provide opportunities for
candidates to:
•  give clear responses to the questions they are asked (AO1)
•  develop their responses as far as they are able (AO1)
•  express ideas and opinions
•  use a variety of vocabulary, grammatical structures and different timeframes

accurately (AO3).

Candidates may refer to notes made on the theme of the conversation during the
preparation time which must be given to the teacher immediately after the assessment.

Questioning technique:
•  Teachers should avoid asking prepared questions and should instead build a

conversation based on individual candidate responses.

•  Questions should ideally be succinct so that there is less teacher talk and more

candidate talk.

•  Closed questions, which generally lead to yes/no answers, should be followed-up with
an opportunity to express opinions or give more information (prompted, for example,
by ‘¿Por qué?’ or ¿Por qué no?’).

•  Where possible, more open questions should be used in order to allow the candidate

to offer more information/more developed responses.

•  Useful question openers for extended answers could be ‘Háblame de…’, ‘Describe

tu/s…’ or ¿ ‘Qué piensas de…?’ for example.

Total time for conversation: 2-4 minutes
Total marks: 25
(AO1 – 20 marks) (AO3 – 5 marks)

Teachers should tailor the complexity of the questions to the ability of the candidate.
Questions may be repeated or rephrased during this part of the task. The teacher should
use their judgement as to when to move on if a candidate does not understand or respond
to a question even after rephrasing. In order to sustain conversation and avoid long
silences, it is better to move to a different question to encourage the candidate to keep
talking. Candidates should be given the opportunity to respond in the present, past and
future tenses. Candidates may refer to notes to support them with the theme of the
conversation which must be given to the teacher immediately after the assessment.

7

 GCSE Spanish Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 8

When asking questions Teachers should use the different areas of the broad theme as
well as the candidate’s interests and experiences to continue the conversation.
Candidates should be given the opportunity to respond in the present, past and future
tenses.

Allocation of Role play cards:

The allocation of cards for the role play will be generated by the candidate’s choice of
broad theme for the presentation.

If the candidate’s choice of presentations is from Theme 1, they must be allocated a role
play from Theme 2. If the candidate’s choice of presentations is from Theme 2, they must
be allocated a role play from Theme 1. If the candidate’s choice of presentations is from
Theme 3, they may be allocated a role play from either Theme 1 or Theme 2.

There will be six role plays for Theme 1 and six role plays for Theme 2.

The first candidate must be given either card 1a or card 2a, depending on their choice of
presentation. The second candidate must be given the prescribed card from the next row
(depending on their choice of presentation), this sequence will continue for each teacher
(not by the centre as a whole). After breaks in testing (including lunchtime and overnight)
the sequence should continue. For example, if candidate 3 is tested before a break, the
next candidate will be candidate 4. Teachers must follow this prescribed order.

Task setting

Tasks are set by WJEC. The assessment will be carried out by teachers at the centre,
audio recorded and marked by external examiners. The role play cards will be sent to the
Examinations Officer at the centre in a secure pack. Each centre will receive two packs.
There will be instructions not to open the package until the specified date. Each candidate
will be allocated one card. The list allocating the card to each candidate is shown above.
The teacher must ensure that each candidate is assessed with the correct card. Teacher
prompts for the role play, and guidance on setting questions for the discussion and
conversation are provided below. The Teacher may open the packs up to three working
days in advance of the first assessment date at the centre.

Centres must keep a record of the schedule (including dates) on which the assessments
are conducted on the declaration form below. This form is for the centre and candidates to
sign and declare that assessments have been conducted according to the requirements in
the Assessment Pack and this must be submitted to WJEC with the audio recordings.
Audio files should be uploaded to the WJEC Portal within 48 hours or two working days of
the speaking assessments taking place.

Task taking

Each candidate will have a preparation time of ten minutes prior to the commencement of
the assessment. This preparation time must be supervised by an exam invigilator
organised by the centre and who is not a subject specialist.
Candidates are not permitted to use dictionaries in any part of the assessment, including
the preparation time.

Candidates are advised to spend their 10 minutes preparation time, practising the read-
aloud sub-vocally, making notes on what to say in the role play and conversation and of
course, practising their presentation.

The candidate may bring prepared bullet points [maximum 30 words] to support with the
delivery of the presentation into the assessment. During the preparation time, the
candidate may, if they wish, make notes on the read aloud and role play, and the allocated
theme of the conversation on one-side of A4 paper and refer to these during the
assessment. The teacher must check the notes prior to the commencement of the
assessment and remove the bullet points from the candidate if they contain complete and
continuous sentences. Otherwise, the notes must be handed to the teacher at the end of
the test, along with the role play. After the preparation period of 10 minutes, the teacher
must ensure that the candidate spends the following times on each task:

Approximate timings for oral assessment

The timing for the read aloud and role play is approximately 2 minutes but this will depend
on each candidate. The timing for the presentation, discussion and conversation should
be adhered to so that the candidate is able to access the full range of marks. The overall

 GCSE Spanish Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 10

timings must be adhered to and any speaking evidence that exceeds these timings will not
be marked.

Conducting the assessment

Candidates will be allowed one attempt at the assessment. Once the recording begins it
cannot be paused or stopped until the end of the assessment. The only circumstances in
which a candidate can be re-tested are if there is a technical malfunction during the
assessment (so that, for example, the assessment has not been recorded or is inaudible)
or an incident occurs beyond the teacher’s control which prevents the completion of the
assessment. In any such circumstance, the teacher must inform WJEC immediately via
the Examinations Officer at the centre. WJEC will then inform the centre which role play to
use in place of the original allocation.

Detailed instructions regarding the process for submitting the materials will be
communicated to centres through Examination Officers.

When introducing each candidate, the following convention must be used:
Specification/centre number/candidate number/candidate name/role play card/
presentation theme/conversation theme/date.

Speaking
and
Listening

Learners should be able to:
•  develop their listening skills to understand and respond to
different types of spoken language in a range of different
contexts

•  use their knowledge of grammar and vocabulary to

support their understanding including the relationship
between the past, present and future tenses

•  communicate and interact clearly and effectively for

different purposes

•  communicate information, ideas and opinions in a variety

of contexts

•  use their knowledge of vocabulary and grammar to

•

communicate meaningfully
reference past, present and future events where
appropriate

•  use more complex structures where appropriate
•  use generally accurate pronunciation and intonation.

Practise listening and reacting to spoken Spanish regularly, through for
example, the use of audio, video clips, teacher recorded listening
activities, and pair and group activities which involve giving and receiving
information.  Questions from SAMs for Unit 1 could be used for revision
but also for starters and plenaries in lessons, as well as whole class
exam run throughs involving discussion of how to tackle different types
of questions on each part of the exam. Regular use of speaking activities
such as ‘trapdoor’, and ‘find someone who...’ can build confidence whilst
providing a model of the language to support learners.

Practise pronunciation regularly, addressing common errors in order to
develop confidence on the first role play sentence which is the sound-
spelling correspondence task. Learners should have opportunities to
read aloud from a range of material so that they consolidate patterns and
develop confidence, using audio applications may assist with this during
lessons for learners to self-check. Learners would benefit from access to
a reference list of common sound-spelling correspondence rules to
which they could refer as they read aloud, for example when working in
pairs, so that they can reflect upon and improve each other’s
pronunciation. A variety of activities which would support learners to
consider sound-spelling correspondence include listening to songs,
video clips and completing gap-fill activities, or the teacher
mispronouncing words that learners are reading and asking learners to
spot the mistake.

12

 GCSE Spanish Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 13

Ensure learners are familiar with question words in Spanish and are able
to formulate questions themselves.  Activities such as matching
questions and answers in Spanish, providing an answer and asking the
learners to formulate the question, ‘what am I?’ and ‘guess who?’ can
help develop proficiency.

Ensure learners understand the ‘tú’ and ‘usted’ form of verbs to support
them in responding to role play tasks and that they have the opportunity
to practise using these in role play phrases and questions.  Tasks where
learners choose the right form based on the person and situation may be
useful e.g. responding to the headteacher, a friend, an elderly neighbour.
Practise manipulating common verbs into present, past and future
tenses, through starter activities such as drilling verb endings, re-
ordering sentences and choosing the correct verb to complete a
sentence.  Ensure learners can recognise time markers in past, present
and future tenses, through approaches such as categorising, word banks
and gap-fill exercises.

Support pupils to develop a bank of useful opinions and complex
phrases which they are confident in using, through including these in
starter tasks, for example categorise the phrase into sentence
starter/opinion/reason and consider creating cross topic knowledge
organisers from which learners can select a range of phrases.
Encourage pupils to include a range of opinions, reasons and complex
phrases, with different tenses, in every task where they produce Spanish
so that they become confident in this, knowledge organisers or similar
can support them with selecting these appropriately.  This can be
practised by regularly asking pupils to formulate opinions and reasons on
different topics, either as a mini plenary using whiteboards or as a longer
task in pairs/groups.  ‘Speed dating’ where learners ask several other
learners for responses and react to these may be helpful.

Learners should be able to demonstrate their understanding
of Spanish through their responses in a range of different
settings to include the following:
•
train / bus station
•
tourist information office
•  cinema / theatre / venue
•  campsite / hostel / hotel
•  pharmacy / doctor’s surgery / hospital
•
•  shops
•  café / restaurant
•

•

leisure centre

Practise the key vocabulary that will be needed for role play tasks in
these settings.

There are multiple ways of teaching and learning vocabulary.  Activities
where learners test themselves or each other can work well in
consolidating recall.  Learners can test each other from the vocabulary
lists provided by WJEC, you may wish to make card games or sets from
these with which learners can test each other in pairs or groups
Teachers may also find apps helpful for learners to learn and test
themselves. ‘Memrise’ or ‘Quizlet’ and online activities such as ‘Kahoot’
and ‘Blooket’ can be useful as revision, home learning and class
activities.

Learners should be able to engage in transactions including:
•  asking and responding to questions
•  asking for advice
•  making a complaint
•
reporting a problem
•  explaining, describing and giving reasons
•  expressing opinions.

Learn and practise useful sentence starters and verbs.  Activities where
the sentence is given but needs to be re-ordered can provide a model.
Working in pairs and groups of learners can be helpful when practising
these responses. Learners should be encouraged to consider what they
can say in Spanish to meet the response as responses are usually not
prescriptive, therefore many different answers can be acceptable
providing the grammar is correct.

Learners will be required to:
•  participate in a role play
•  give a presentation, prepared in advance, based on their

own interest and take part in a short unprepared
discussion relating to the presentation
take part in a short unprepared conversation.

•

Teachers should ensure that learners are familiar with the mark scheme
and that during the role play, they do not extend answers but instead
focus on an accurate and suitable response with a verb for each
response which they formulate.  Regularly practising a role play phrase
as a starter activity can be helpful, as can asking learners to formulate a
response and display it on a mini whiteboard before discussing the
appropriate responses as a class.  This approach can also be used with
forming the question.  Encourage learners to be a ‘detective’ and decide
what the instruction is asking them for e.g. a past tense verb. Learners
could write and test/perform for each other in role plays.

14

 GCSE Spanish Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 15

Learners should be encouraged to develop extended sentences in the
presentation and to practise the pronunciation of their planned
presentation.  They should aim to attempt extended answers to the
discussion questions in order to develop their responses.

Learners should have regular opportunities to present to others in a
range of contexts. You may wish to begin with learners presenting a few
sentences on a subject that they have researched, providing sentence
starters as a guide. Initially, this could be carried out in pairs/groups and
with visual support such as a PowerPoint or Sway. Presentations could
also be encouraged in the style of a podcast or guide on aspects such as
a region or cultural practice of Spain or a Spanish speaking country.  In
preparation for delivering their presentation NEA, learners should also
have regular practise devising bullet points to support their
presentations.

You may wish to take an example presentation and discuss explicitly
with the class what the key points are that would formulate the bullet
points and how these would best help them to remember the structure of
their work. Learners could then carry out this activity for other exemplar
presentations before devising bullet points for their own work. · Mock
NEA tasks can be helpful in allowing learners to practise this skill under
NEA conditions.

Learners become accustomed to anticipating the sorts of questions that
might be asked about their presentations. This could be done in groups
or as a class activity. You could also encourage learners to formulate a
follow-up question each to ask peers who are presenting to the class on
different topics. As well as helping them to predict questions, this will
also help develop learners’ listening skills.

For the conversation, learners would benefit from confidence in using
opinions, reasons, manipulating tenses and being able to ask a simple
question of the teacher.

15

 GCSE Spanish Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 16

It is important to remind learners that the grammatical structures and
vocabulary they learn across the three themes can be transferred and
recycled in different contexts. Learners should be given regular
opportunities to convey information, describe and narrate events across
the three themes, and to develop their responses by providing opinions
and reasons. Word banks/vocabulary mats can be useful to build
familiarity, as can encouraging learners to create their own personalised
lists of phrases in different tenses, with opinions, reasons and
connectives which they develop and become familiar with over the
course.

Discussion with learners around the preparation of questions for such
activities would be part of preparation and it would be important to
highlight that questions should be designed to allow learners to respond
in different tenses and to develop and extend their answers as fully as
possible with consideration of the strengths of the individual learner.
It may be helpful to devise a bank of questions for learners across the
three themes which include opportunities for expression in the past,
present and future tenses and to give extended answers. However, this
should not be exhaustive and should be adapted in the NEA to best
support and stretch each individual learner.  Tense work could also be
practised, for example by asking learners to change a conversation
about the future into the past by changing tenses and time markers.
Learners could practise from the question bank using card prompts to
generate quick fire responses to build confidence.

Learning Experiences

Learners should be encouraged to consider the following learning experiences and skills to
further develop their understanding, appreciation and awareness of the subject content.
Information in the table below provides opportunities for teachers to integrate the learning
experiences into delivery.

Learning Experience

Exemplification of Learning Experience

Learn about the culture and
society in the countries and
communities where the
international language is
spoken

Role play tasks are based on real-life interactions in Spanish
speaking countries.

For Theme 1, learners could listen and respond to material on
Spanish-speaking figures, using this as a basis for practise of
presentation and conversation tasks.

Explore the cross-cutting
themes of human rights and
diversity, including Black,
Asian and minority ethnic
perspectives, identity, culture
and contributions

Have direct or indirect contact
with speakers of the language

For Theme 2, learners could focus on a Spanish-speaking country
and practise presenting their information in a logical structure with
peers asking questions to practise question formulation.

Pupils may choose to discuss some of these issues in their
speaking presentation for Unit 1. You may wish to watch a film
based in a Spanish speaking country such as ‘La Misma Luna’
which documents the experiences of a range of Mexican Americans
and explores the issues of legal and illegal immigration through a
child’s perspective.  Learners may use aspects of the film as a
starting point for their presentation, practising giving opinions,
reasons and narrating events.

There is a rich variety of Spanish language music which could be
useful for practising sound spelling correspondence through gap fill
activities of lyrics, whilst exploring the themes of the songs.

Centres may choose to engage with initiatives such as MFL
Mentoring Cymru, Routes into Languages and Taith who provide
multilingualism opportunities and exchanges with native speakers.
Learners could work with the ambassador either through video
conferencing or face-to-face. They could, for example, prepare to
interview the speaker and in preparation they could devise
questions, giving consideration to a suitable register. Such an
interview could be based around any of the three themes but may fit
particularly well with Theme 3; as student ambassadors are studying
at Welsh universities it may be valuable to focus on areas such as
their higher education and future plans, looking at how their
language journey has informed their study and career choices. Taith
may afford the opportunity for travel or exchange with learners in a
Spanish speaking country, with the significant level of transactional
language practise that this affords learners.

Centres can also apply for funding via Taith - Hwb (gov.wales) to
take part in educational international exchanges.

Centres could also partner with a school in a Spanish-speaking
country, for example, via the British Council: Partner with a school.

This may cover a variety of themes, as well as providing useful
transactional language practise and sound spelling correspondence.

Learners will have the opportunity to engage with the language from
a variety of sources such as literature, media and in different
contexts as they practise the skills of oracy. They will use language
for different purposes and contexts.  Podcasts, interviews and video
clips from Spanish speaking media such as BBC Mundo may be
useful with support such as subtitles, vocabulary lists. These could
be used for practising listening, sound spelling correspondence, as
well as a starting point for building sentences using opinions,
reasons and narrating events.

Demonstrate language
strategies and language
learning skills, including the
use of dictionaries

Learners will have the opportunity to demonstrate language
strategies and language learning skills. Learners will demonstrate
transactional language skills as well as preparing their own
presentation and engaging in discussion and conversation.

Translanguaging

Make use of digital
technology

Making appropriate
connections with other parts
of the curriculum to develop
and deepen learners’ bilingual
and multilingual skills

Learners should be taught how to identify and search for nouns,
verbs, adjectives and adverbs and how to recognise and apply
these to their own speaking work. Activities such as cloze tasks,
colour coding and categorising may be helpful. Analysing how parts
of a sentence fit together can support learners in their own use of
grammar.

Learners will have the opportunity to use their translanguaging skills,
through discussion on topics which have impact both in Wales and
Spanish speaking countries.

It may be interesting to study the Welsh context in Patagonia and
the links between the region and Wales currently.

Learners will have the opportunity to make use of digital technology
which may be particularly beneficial when practising speaking and
responding to Spanish.

For example, learners can record and play back audio of
themselves speaking and practising Spanish.  They may use
technology as part of an exchange project or to speak with a student
languages ambassador, as well as to practise vocabulary using
apps.

Learners will be encouraged to make connections with other parts of
the curriculum throughout their learning of Spanish with cross-
curricular connections to humanities subjects, and of course with the
other languages within the LLC Area of Learning Experience.

The three broad themes will allow learners to make links between
their experiences in Wales and those in Spanish speaking countries
as well as linking to many areas of the Curriculum for Wales.

Where appropriate, links may be drawn between grammatical
structures, such as the formal and informal you, and where
vocabulary has a similar word stem to Welsh.

Cross-cutting Themes

There are many opportunities to include Local, National & International Contexts and
Sustainability in GCSE Spanish. These opportunities are important to Learners because
they allow them to explore current issues and debates around sustainability in different

speaking countries.  For example, they could practise giving opinions relating to restrictions in
Spanish holiday resorts or around environmental issues in Spanish countries.  This could be
practised in class by responding to video clips or images as stimulus material.  Learners may
choose to prepare their presentation on an issue related to this to explore it in more detail.
•  Learners could explore links between Spanish-speaking cultures and Welsh, such as the
Welsh community of Patagonia, and use this as a basis for presentation topics, as well as
listening to and responding to audio visual material which would allow listening and speaking
practise.

question words.

•  Learners could take part in oracy games such as a running dictation which encourages

both the speaker and the writer to focus on the accuracy of sound-spelling
correspondence.

•  Learners can complete gap-fill or comprehension questions from audio, video and songs.

Example

•  Learners will speak for a range of purposes, for transactional language in the role play, to more
extended speech during presentation and discussion and the conversation where they can
explore ideas, narrate events and describe opinions and reasons in more detail.

•  Learners can practise spoken language in pair and group activities, where they have to seek or
exchange information, such as ‘speed dating’, ‘find someone who...’ and record the language
they hear.
