GCSE CYMRAEG LANGUAGE
AND LITERATURE

INTRODUCTION

1.1  Aims

The GCSE Cymraeg Language and Literature qualification must support
Learners to be able to:

•  appreciate how language connects us to the world around us through

engagement with the spoken word, visual texts and written texts from a range of
times, places and cultures
read, watch and listen to a range of spoken and written texts, considering how
language, register and style convey meaning

•

•  understand the significance of purpose, audience, medium and context in
communicating, expressing, understanding and responding to language

•  express themselves in speaking and writing through clear, accurate, fluent and

creative use of Cymraeg

•  develop and apply knowledge and understanding of the vocabulary, grammar

and uses of Cymraeg

•  The qualification must also be designed to promote a positive and relevant

experience of Cymraeg and Welsh Cultures.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales’ Approval Criteria.

1.2  Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Cymraeg Language and Literature qualification is underpinned by the
Curriculum for Wales framework.  It was designed to ensure that learners can
continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this
qualification.

Central to this design are the principles of progression, along with the statements of
what matters and those subject specific skills and concepts outlined in the ‘Designing
your Curriculum' section of the Languages, Literacy and Communication Area of
Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to
embed the cross-cutting themes and where there are opportunities for integral and
cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple mapping, and
information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for
integrating the learning experiences noted on page 24;  the Guidance for Teaching
will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2024

GCSE CYMRAEG LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE 8

The GCSE Cymraeg Language and Literature qualification supports the Curriculum
for Wales by:

•  supporting the statements of what matters1, giving learners the opportunity to:
•  develop their understanding, empathy and their ability to respond and to

•

mediate effectively
interact, explore ideas, express viewpoints, knowledge and understanding
and build relationships

•  experience and respond to a variety of diverse literature that gives them

insight into the culture, people and history of Wales as well as the wider world

•  spark their imagination and creativity.

•  supporting the principles of progression2 by giving learners the opportunity to:

•  build on their linguistic skills
•  grow holistically in their understanding and purposeful use of languages,

literacy and communication

•  apply their understanding of linguistic concepts
•  adapt and manipulate language to communicate effectively to a range of

different audiences

•  develop receptive, interpretive and expressive language skills
•

transfer existing knowledge and skills into new contexts including the social
and cultural aspects of language.

•  supporting the key considerations for language development and literature

choice3, giving learners the opportunity to:
•  experience relevant, engaging, authentic and challenging stimuli to inspire

purposeful speaking and writing
•  experience a wealth of literature.

1.3  Prior Learning and Progression

Although prior learning is not one of the specific requirements, the qualification is
primarily designed for learners aged 14-16. It therefore builds on the conceptual
understanding developed by learners through their learning from ages 3-14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills
and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares
learners for life, learning and work.  The qualification provides a suitable foundation
for the study of GCSE Cymraeg Language and Literature at either AS or A level.  In
addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of
study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

1.4  Guided Learning Hours

GCSE CYMRAEG LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE 9

The GCSE Cymraeg Language and Literature, Single Award Qualification has been
designed to be delivered over a period of 120 – 140 guided learning hours.  The
GCSE Cymraeg Language and Literature, Double Award Qualification has been
designed to be delivered over a period of 240 – 280 guided learning hours.  They
have been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and
11.

1.5  Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our
language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect
and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and
adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising
that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to
ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres
of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always
be on the website.

1.6  Equality and fair access

This specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic,
religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible,
features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access
and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual
orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to
enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills
without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the
following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access
Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments and Special Consideration: General and
Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website
(www.jcq.org.uk).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of
provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete
barrier to any part of the assessment.

SUBJECT CONTENT

The 'Further Information' Column

The further information provided in the right-hand column uses the following sentence stems:
'learners should be able to' is used when learners will need to apply their knowledge and
•
understanding.
'learners should understand' is used when learners need to demonstrate their knowledge
and understanding rather than applying their knowledge, understanding or skills.
'learners will be required' is used to indicate the specific requirements of individual units.

•

•

The use of the phrase 'including' indicates that the specified content must be taught and may
be subject to assessment.

Integrating Language and Literature

This qualification integrates Cymraeg Language and Literature. It is therefore important to be
aware of the following presumptions:
•

the term 'literature' is used in its broadest sense, to denote all written material whatever
its purpose. It is not intended to denote only imaginative works of poetry or prose.
learners will be required to analyse the literature they study from linguistic and literary
perspectives in order to explore their impact and/or how they create meaning.

•

•  as part of their learning, learners are expected to consider aspects of Cymraeg, using

literature as a way of doing so. Vocabulary, grammar and syntax should be considered
throughout the course, not only in the context of the learners' own work, but also in the
context of the literature studied. Knowledge and understanding of Cymraeg will be
assessed in examination units; the application of Cymraeg skills will be assessed in each
unit.

submitted with the recording of the assessment task.

The role of the teacher during the oral discussion
During the group discussion the teacher should provide the group with an opportunity
to have an independent discussion.

Teacher support should be limited to an explanation of the tasks. If a teacher
intervenes, for example to provide encouragement to a learner, then this should be
noted and taken into account when assessing.

If necessary, the teacher should:
•  stimulate a discussion
•  encourage a change of direction for the discussion
•  ask the learner to provide evidence to confirm ideas or develop an argument

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

5.1  Entries and Awards

This is a unitised qualification. Candidates are entered for each unit separately.

Non-examination assessment opportunities (Unit 2, Unit 3 and Unit 5) will only be
available in the summer series each year, while examination assessment
opportunities (Unit 1, Unit 4a, Unit 4b and Unit 6) will be available in the summer
series and in November each year, until the end of the life of the specification. Please
note that November cash-in is only available to post-16 candidates.

Unit 1, Unit 2 and Unit 3 will first be available in summer 2026.

Unit 4b will be available for the first time in November 2026.

Unit 4a, Unit 5 and Unit 6 will be available for the first time in summer 2027.

Pre-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or under on 31st August in the
academic year in which they were entered)

The terminal rule is set at 30% of the overall qualification for Pre-16 Candidates for
GCSE Cymraeg Language and Literature (Double Award and Single Award) and this
must include an examination.

If the assessment being re-taken contributes to the 30% terminal rule requirement,
the marks for the new assessment will count regardless of previous results in that
assessment.

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score
from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade subject to the
terminal rule being satisfied first i.e. that candidates must complete 30% of the
assessment for a qualification in the series in which they are cashing in.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the
third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s).
This is referred to as a ‘fresh start’. When retaking a qualification (fresh start), a
candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from
examination units taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating the new
grade(s).

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not
count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in
the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be used for the life of the specification.

Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1st September in the
academic year in which they are entered)

There is no terminal rule that applies to Post-16 Candidates for GCSE GCSE
Cymraeg Language and Literature (Double Award and Single Award).

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2024

GCSE CYMRAEG LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE 33

There is no limit on the number of times candidates can resit an individual unit;
however, the better uniform mark score from only the two most recent attempts will
be used in calculating the final overall grade.

The ‘fresh start’ rule does not apply to post-16 candidates.

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not
count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in
the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be used for the life of the specification.

Conversion of a Double Award result to a Single Award result

Post-16* candidates can request the conversion of a Double Award result to a Single
Award result.

The rules regarding this conversion are:
•  A post-16* candidate must have cashed-in for the Double Award before a request

for a conversion can be made for the Single Award.

•  Performance in Unit 4b of the Double Award will be used as a proxy for Unit 4a of

the Single Award for the purposes of this conversion.

•  This route is not permissible for pre-16* candidates.
•  A request can be made by a centre for a conversion for the lifetime of the

specification.

•  A centre must obtain candidate permission and ensure their eligibility before

submitting a request for a conversion.

•  Candidates will not be able to do the following:

i)
ii)

use unit 4a for the Double Award cash-in
convert from a Single Award result to a Double Award result.
•  Candidates cannot receive a result for both the Single Award and Double Award

in a single series.

 * Candidates who have cashed in in the summer of year 11 but aren’t 16 are eligible.

Approved conversions rescind the Double Award result and issues a candidate a
new Single Award result.

The procedures for requesting a conversion will be available to centres prior to the
first award.
