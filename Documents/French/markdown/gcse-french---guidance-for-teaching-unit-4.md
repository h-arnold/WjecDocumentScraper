## Assessment details

Written examination: 1 hour 30 mins Set and marked by WJEC 35% of qualification 70 marks

This unit requires learners to respond to a range of questions with fixed responses and responses in Cymraeg/English, to translate short extracts from the assessed language into Cymraeg/English and to respond in the assessed language to a choice of written tasks.

The unit is divided into 2 sections - Section A and Section B. Each section will cover all broad themes.

In Section A, a reading task will provide the stimulus for the translation task. Translation in this context means a sufficient and appropriate rendering of the meaning of the original language.

Texts will only use the grammar and vocabulary specified in this specification. Words outside of the specification grammar and vocabulary lists will be glossed. For written production, the expected language will be from the specified content (vocabulary and grammar), with equal credit given for language used that is beyond the defined content but that fulfils the task requirements.

The Rubrics will be in Cymraeg/English.

Stimuli will be in the assessed language.

All responses will be non-verbal and in Cymraeg/English, apart from the response in Section B to the extended writing task.

Learners are not permitted to use a dictionary in any part of the assessment.

Section A: four comprehension questions and translation (AO2 - 35 marks)

Learners will read a range of texts linked to each of the broad themes:

- texts based on practical transactional language such as information notices and signs
- factual texts such as an e-mail, poster, web page, letter, newspaper article, flyer, graph, advert
- prose such as continuous literary texts, extracts from short stories, magazine articles.

Learners will demonstrate understanding of the texts by responding to a range of questions in Cymraeg/English. Question types will include: multiple choice questions, true/false with justification, matching words/phrases with definitions/images, matching statements with their source, short answers in Cymraeg/English, gap-fill, finish the sentences, comprehension questions to demonstrate understanding.

## Section B:

Question 6 (35 marks) (AO2 - 20 marks) (AO3 - 15 marks)

Learners will write an extended piece of writing in response to written prompts. There will be a choice of three options in Cymraeg/English, one from each broad theme. Learners will respond to the question prompts writing up to a maximum of 120 words in the assessed language.

| Reading and Writing   | Learners should be able to: • understand and respond to different types of written language in a range of contexts • understand and respond to different types of language written for different purposes and audience • identify the overall message, key points and opinions in spoken and written passages, some involving more complex language, and draw conclusions where appropriate • use knowledge of grammar to support understanding, including recognising the relationship between past, present and future events • translate short and simple texts from French to Cymraeg/English • communicate clearly and effectively in writing for a variety of purposes, including communicating information, describing, narrating, expressing and justifying opinions • communicate meaning in writing in a range of formal and informal contexts • use knowledge of vocabulary and grammar to communicate meaningfully, using more complex structures which reference past, present and future events where appropriate. | When delivering through themes, please be aware that themes are not part of the specification. The only content required to be taught is the vocabulary/grammar and we have provided notional themes that centres may wish to teach the vocabulary within for context. When planning delivery of themes consider the following to reduce the burden of learning lists of language out of context: • What vocabulary is essential for the teaching of this theme? • What vocabulary is reviewed across sub-themes? • Are there any sentence structures that are repeated often within the theme? • How can grammar be covered in a meaningful way? To prepare learners for the comprehension tasks focus on developing understanding of vocabulary. Activities may include: • Word clouds / webs - learners can create thematic word clouds or word webs with essential vocabulary for specific tasks. These can be revisited during review activities and any additional vocabulary or structures learners encounter can be added. The aim is to create a bank of relevant and context led language that learners might encounter in reading tasks. Much of the vocabulary and many of the structures will be repeated across the broad themes so learners are repeatedly required to recall prior learning. • Skim reading - learners can be given short texts to read within a specific time limit to avoid the temptation for narrow reading and the desire to understand every word.

Include language used in WJEC rubrics in classroom tasks (Which.. ? / How many ...? / Give 1 example / Give 2 reasons etc.) • Break it down - learners can develop their confidence when faced with longer passages of text by re-writing in shorter sentences. Ensure understanding of word groups (connectives / verbs / pronouns / adjectives etc.) so that learners can recognise them in a longer sentence, extract them and write a number of simplified sentences. This exercise will help them understand how to create more complicated sentences of their own in written tasks. (je suis allé en France avec ma famille et nous avons visité les sites touristiques puis nous sommes allés à la plage, mais nous n'avons pas nagé dans la mer car il faisait trop froid.= Je suis allé en France. J'y suis allé avec ma famille. Nous avons visité les sites touristiques. etc.) This type of activity can also be flipped to create longer passages from shorter sentences as a differentiated task.   |

| Learners will be required to read a range of texts linked to each of the broad themes including: • texts based on practical transactional language such as information notices and signs • factual texts such as an e-mail, poster, web page, letter, newspaper article, flyer, graph, advert • prose such as continuous literary texts, extracts from short stories, magazine articles. | Although assessment tasks will reflect the vocabulary and grammar lists provided, language learning is often more relevant when it is based on real-life situations and authentic materials. Consider sourcing a variety of reading material that is aimed at a lower age group in French speaking countries, tourist information sites, or translated works of familiar texts. Examples may include: • 1 jour 1 question (transcripts and glossary may be necessary) • Extracts in French from British authors works such as J.K. Rowling / Roald Dahl / David Walliams • Regional tourism websites with language options. These can be useful for modelling text types, extracting core language, gist reading for understanding, grammar gap-fill, translation practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Learners will be required to: • demonstrate understanding of the texts by responding to a range of questions in Cymraeg/English • translate sentences into Cymraeg/English within a context • write in French in response to a stimulus.   | Questioning to assess understanding invariably leads to the following: • Who? • Where? • When? • What? • Why? • How? Provide opportunities for learners to extract this information from texts and to reproduce similar texts in French. Activities could include: • Narrow reading - extracts of literary texts or articles are suited to this activity as there is often a subject, a setting and an activity. (Example: l a pollution plastique est un fléau de notre société qui concerne tout le monde. Les poissons, les oiseaux, les animaux marins sont tous en danger. Environ 10 millions tonnes de plastique sont jetées dans nos océans chaque année à cause des déchets plastiques jetables comme les bouteilles, les sacs ou l'emballage ). • Summarise in Cymraeg / English - equally a similar text with underlined sentences can then be translated into the language of choice. • Timed writing - Provide a time limit to prepare learners for the writing tasks. As a stimulus for writing, use text-based activities that show vocabulary in context, model key grammatical structures in varied tenses, and are of a similar length to that which learners need to produce. Structure strips are also useful tools for this activity as they will remind learners that they must respond to each bullet point (example: Say what you did ...? 3 sentences. Past tense. 10 minutes). • Leapfrog tenses - review grammar and knowledge of high frequency verbs in a gapfill grid (example simple table below) and ask learners to apply these verbs to a task (the focus is Broad theme: leisure and wellbeing).   |

These opportunities are important to Learners because through reading a variety of text types and producing their own written work learners can broaden their understanding of French culture within real-world contexts. Below are some examples of how Local, National & International Contexts can be embedded into teaching and learning:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Local, National & International Contexts | Example In this unit learners need to see the French language used in a variety of ways which are relatable to them. This will encourage them to make the links between local, national and international contexts so that French is relevant in their day-to day lives. Informative text/Factual writing: • Introduce the vocabulary necessary to describe the local area. • Provide success criteria (this can be co-created as a mind-map or thought cloud) • Recycle the key structures and vocabulary to create a flyer or poster which informs people about the area. (... se trouve…/Il y a .../C'est ...) Creative text / Persuasive writing: • Choose a town / city / famous landmark in a French-speaking country. • Review the imperative. • Scaffold or brainstorm criteria and key vocabulary. • Learners create an advert / design a webpage to persuade people from Wales / their local town to visit the French-speaking town / city / landmark. |

| Sustainability   | There are many opportunities to include Sustainability in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because understanding how each citizen has a responsibility to work towards a more sustainable future and build awareness of environmental issues is a global priority. Below are some examples of how Sustainability can be embedded into teaching and learning:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sustainability   | Example Eco survey: • Provide a multiple choice 'personality quiz' activity to assess how eco-friendly we are (Q1. Chez moi je fais le tri a. toujours b. parfois. c.jamais etc.) • After completing the survey / quiz learners summarise their answers in writing to create a short paragraph about their own 'gestes écologiques' • Learners can go on to read more challenging texts with the familiar vocabulary and discuss what sustainability means to them in the local area / at home / in school. This type of activity could be adapted to other cross-cutting themes and is an effective springboard task. Flipped literacy: • Provide a sample response to a writing task about climate change/pollution, etc • Ensure the text is split into 4 paragraphs with opinions and references to past, present and future. • Learners read the text and create bullet points to summarise it (what you do at home/what you did yesterday/what you will do from now on) • Provide surplus choice / mixed up headings for differentiation purposes as additional support. This type of activity will prepare learners for the writing assessment whilst also re-enforcing comprehension skills. As above it could be adapted to a range of cross-cutting themes which are relevant and interesting to the learners. |

| Relationships and Sexuality Education   | There are many opportunities to include Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because through language we learn how to communicate in an informed manner about sensitive topics with empathy and understanding. Learners develop knowledge and awareness that will allow them to develop respect and a healthy attitude towards others. Below are some examples of how RSE can be embedded into teaching and learning:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Relationships and Sexuality Education   | Example Match-up / Multiple choice: • Create a scenario where there is conflict (between friendship groups/between teachers and pupils etc) • Review the imperative for certain regular / irregular verbs • Give learners a series of statements to read (possibly aloud) and work together to choose a solution. • Provide 2 or 3 sensible and ridiculous ideas per conflict as that is much more fun! (Raisons de conflits = Ma mère m'oblige à manger du brocoli alors que je le déteste / Je dois faire trop de devoirs / Mon copain n'aime pas la musique de Taylor Swift. Solutions = Fais la cuisine une fois par semaine/donne au chien/achète un chien/Fais la grève/embauche quelqu'un pour t'aider/Parle à un adulte/dis-lui que tu l'aimes / dis-lui que c'est fini etc). Pardon?: • Read (or play an audio of) a text which relates to the cross-cutting theme out loud whilst learners read a transcript • Deliberately change some details to assess whether learners are concentrating on the text and / or also listening • Learners shout out 'Pardon?', when you make a mistake / change. (Listen : Je suis allé au cinéma avec ma nouvelle copine hier soir et nous avons regardé La Vitesse. C'était un désastre car j'avais mangé des escargots à l'ail avant! Read : Je suis allé au théâtre (pardon?) avec ma nouvelle copine samedi dernier (Pardon?) etc). |

| Human Rights Education and Diversity   | There are many opportunities to include Human Rights Education and Diversity in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because as ethical and informed citizens of Wales and the World (four purposes), the study of another language and culture helps learners develop respect and empathy towards others. Below are some examples of how Human Rights Education and Diversity can be embedded into teaching and learning:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Human Rights Education and Diversity   | Example Translation: • Choose a text or clip about / by a French-speaking celebrity that represents cultural diversity/HRE (Examples: Simone de Beauvoir/N'Golo Kante/Marie-Astrid Mence) • Adapt the text to a shorter word count (50-60 words) if necessary to ensure a suitable language level for your learners (it may be useful to look over the specified vocabulary when doing so) • Underline 5 sections which use core vocabulary and / or essential grammar structures • Learners translate each underlined section to Cymraeg/English. Translanguage: • Read a text/Watch a clip or film in Cymraeg/English which reflects the cross-cutting theme • Provide sentence builders / scaffolding for communication with useful French sentence starters for expressing opinions and giving reasons (examples: Ayant regardé ce film je le trouve + adj./ Ce texte est intéressant car + choice of reasons in sentence builder). This could focus on description and summary instead, however if doing so it's worth chunking both output activities so that learners do not become overwhelmed. |

| Careers and Work- Related Experiences   | There are many opportunities to include Career and Work-Related Experiences (CWRE) in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because pluri-linguicism leads to increased national and international career possibilities. Below are some examples of how CWRE can be embedded into teaching and learning:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Careers and Work- Related Experiences   | Example Job application: • Source or create a selection of short job descriptions • Learners highlight the key requirements for the jobs to practice and recall core vocabulary • Learners can then decide which one they might be good at and prepare a sentence using the vocabulary (Je voudrais postuler pour le travail de ... car ...). Work logbook: • Learners choose or are given a job (online name generator such as Wheel of names can be used for this type of activity) • Provide a tense mat as support and ask learners to write a sentence for Hier/Aujourd'hui/Demain related to their 'job'. To differentiate this task, increase or decrease the amount of support and sentences accordingly. |

|                                      | There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because understanding the universal rules of grammar and spelling improves communication skills in any language. Learners can see how languages are connected through common expectations with regards to literacy. Below are some examples of how Literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Reading                              | Example Quick fire comprehension: • Look at a poster or advert for an activity, that includes shorter sentences • Learners read aloud for pronunciation practice • Learners extract the key information from the poster (When? Where? How much? etc.). A short reading task like this can be a starter or plenary activity. The text can also serve as inspiration for a similar poster / advert or a more extended writing task such as a message to friend asking if they want to go to the event that is mentioned. Skim reading: • Use a longer French text to practice skimming for key points • Provide a time limit (use an online timer for added pressure) • Ask specific questions in Cymraeg/English (What is the main theme of the text?/Who is mentioned?/What do they do?/etc) • Learners can summarise what they have understood from the text as an oracy task or on mini- white boards. This would give them confidence to 'show what they know' without feeling anxious about correct spelling etc. |

| Writing   | Example Spot the error: • Provide a text that includes some of the common errors learners show in their written work (no punctuation/no accents on past participle/incorrect spelling/no agreement etc) • Guide the correction by focusing on one issue at a time or providing a checklist (Are the capital letters in the right places?/Can you see the correct accent? Are the connectives spelt correctly? Are parce que / il y a , separate words? etc • Ask learners to write a similar piece without the mistakes or for differentiation simply re-write the text correctly. This type of task will help learners spot their own mistakes when reading over written work and lead to better peer-assessment when supporting each other to improve.                              |

|           | I start/You finish: • Provide a practice question such as 'Quel travail voudrais-tu faire plus tard dans la vie?) • Begin by asking individuals to write a first part about what they would like to do as a job. (Support could include sentence starter Plus tard je voudrais etre... /word mat aide soignant.e, comedien.ne, medecin, pompier ) • Ask learners to include reasons for more challenge (parce que je veux .../car c'est un emploi... etc) • Ask learners to exchange their first part with a partner. • Learners then continue the partners work in the second section explaining what qualities and skills they have to do the job (Pour faire ce boulot il faut..., il ne faut pas... etc). As pairs they can read through their work and see if they agree or not. |

| Understanding the number system helps us to represent and compare relationships between numbers and quantities | There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because the ability to extract and understand data from text is essential for communicating everyday information such as prices, dates, times, quantities and measurements. Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Understanding the number system helps us to represent and compare relationships between numbers and quantities | Example Virtual shopping: • Review core vocabulary (numbers/clothes/colours etc) • Ask learners to find an outfit for a special occasion (provide a list of 2 or 3 authentic .fr websites if required) • Learners must describe the item and say how much the outfits will cost them. Fact-file: • Provide a graph or info graph with information about population/size of French-speaking countries • Review core vocabulary (countries) and the comparative • Analyse the information and write sentences repeating the key sentence structure (La France est plus peuplée que le Luxembourg). This type of activity can be simplified for use with a learner survey of favourite foods (Cawl est moins populaire que les crepes) or extended to include the superlative (Le Maroc est le plus beau pays francophone). |

|                                                | There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because it supports the delivery of language through making activities and everyday communication relevant to them. Below are some examples of how Digital Competence can be embedded into teaching and learning:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Interacting and Collaborating                  | Example Learners can work together on one document/PowerPoint/presentation over canva/adobe/OneNote or similar apps. • Learners work together to create a class 'playlist' of music / music artists by each completing a 'profile' page/slide in French • Provide the template with key requirements to practise core language (nom/prenom/age/lieu/yeux /cheveux/taille/albums/tubes, etc • Learners research and complete a template each in one file (They can include links and images to their favourite hit etc and everyone can listen to the songs). Virtual exchange: Classroom idea: • Establish links with a university mentor / twinning committee / partnership school (MFL mentoring /British council) with the aim of holding a virtual exchange |
| Producing                                      | Example Create an explainer video for a recipe in French: • Discuss La chandeleur/Mardi gras/Crepes/Galettes • Provide key verbs in the imperative and core vocabulary for food (sequencers such as d'abord, ensuite, puis, etc. may also be useful) • As differentiation provide the vocabulary as a put-in-order activity first • Ask learners to create 'Tiktok' style edited clip following the recipe and making pancakes (les crepes -d'abord prenez les ingredients, ensuite melangez les dans un bol, puis etalez dans un poele, et voilà Miam Miam!).                                                                                                                                                                                                  |



{25}------------------------------------------------



| Create a revision quiz : • As a retrieval task learners can create their own list of multiple choice/gap-fill /type your answer questions based on a unit of work • Provide guidance on question forms if necessary • Encourage learners to refer back to their word banks and written work to ensure accuracy • Use online tools such as Forms/Kahoot/Blooket/Sway/Adobe /genial.ly according to learner competency to create a fun way of measuring progression and understanding.   |

| Critical Thinking and Problem Solving   | Example Tangled translation: • Adapt a text for translation with specific words or word groups in the language of choice. French: je ne mange pas tres healthily car je mange trop de sugar /English: I don't eat very sainement because I eat too much sucre/Cymraeg: Dwi ddim yn bwyta'n sainement iawn achos dwi'n bwyta gormod o sucre • Learners translate into/from French. Debate / Balanced opinion: • Read and annotate a text for advantages / disadvantages (example: Broad theme Language for travel - focus les effets du tourisme) • Ask learners to list the pros/cons • Provide additional sentence structures for expressing a balanced opinion (d'une part... de l'autre part etc) • Learners use the language they have to express their opinions. |



{28}------------------------------------------------



## Planning and Organisation

There are many opportunities to include Planning and Organisation in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because understanding how to recognise criteria and organise their ideas for success is integral to academic achievement. Learners will develop the skills needed to plan responses and ensure each requirement is covered in any given task or assessment.

Below are some examples of how Planning and Organisation can be embedded into teaching and learning:

## Example

Time management:

- Do practice assessments
- Ensure learners read and understand what is expected (look at the marks / include all bullet points etc)
- Ask learners to complete all assessment tasks within the allocated time.

## Slow and steady:

- Ask learners to look over and memorise 5 sentences each lesson.
- Use a combination of new language and prior learning
- Test recall/memory with a mini-whiteboard starter activity such as memory-dump or retrieval grid systematically.

With language acquisition there is always a focus on learning vocabulary and grammar as they are the keys to communication. Apps like Duolingo can help learners with core vocabulary and consistent sentence recall in class helps with confidence and fluency. This type of activity measures progression and makes it clear to learners too.



{29}------------------------------------------------



| Personal Effectiveness   | There are many opportunities to include Personal Effectiveness in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because organisational skills, self-evaluation and tenacity are paramount when learning a new language. Learners will develop self-discipline and time- management through the acquisition of French leading to a sense of pride and achievement when successful. Below are some examples of how Personal Effectiveness can be embedded into teaching and learning:                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Personal Effectiveness   | Example Build a bank of memorised vocabulary: • Provide vocabulary lists/Vocabulary targets in each unit • Use starter activity or recall task to assess learners' knowledge of the vocabulary • Ask learners to keep a 'word bank' of the vocabulary they know and keep adding to it throughout the course. Review written work: • When providing feedback for a piece of writing ensure learners set a goal for improvement (example: use an additional tense) • Review the work and the goal before beginning another written task • Ask learners to include their goal task in the writing so that they can take responsibility for their own progression. |
