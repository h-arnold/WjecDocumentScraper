| Reading and Writing:        | Learners should be able to: • understand and respond to written language • use their knowledge of grammar and vocabulary to support their understanding of the work • use a variety of language patterns and different verb tenses effectively • use complex structures where appropriate • select relevant vocabulary and grammar to express meaning • express themselves in written French to demonstrate their understanding, ideas and opinions. | For assessment purposes this unit requires learners to complete 2 written tasks in French. A 70-word response in writing and a 130-word response in writing. The task rubric will be in English/Cymraeg and the written response needs to be in French. However, the aim of the specification content is to provide learners with an insight to French culture and language through the study of a text from authentic film or literature. When first introducing the work consider the following questions to provide the context for study: • Why is the chosen work culturally significant? • Which broad theme does the chosen work focus on? • Who is the author / writer, director? • What lead you to choose this work? • How could the chosen work reflect the interests of your class? The chosen work may be exploited to provide teaching and learning opportunities that introduce theme-based vocabulary, core grammar and integral skills as part of the French lesson and curriculum planning. |



{12}------------------------------------------------



| Activities may include: • Read aloud tasks - learners may be given digital extracts of a script / text to read with immersive reader (or similar software) before repeating so that they can familiarise themselves with the chosen work, re-enforce understanding of the written content, make links between sound-spelling to improve their French pronunciation. Use of audio recordings (adobe animate from audio / ppt audio record / voice note) will also allow learners to self-check and improve. • Grammar knowledge tasks - learners can find and highlight specific word groups in a text (present tense verbs / adjectives / connectives) to develop their knowledge of grammar and enable them to recall core grammar knowledge necessary for accurate communication in writing. • Vocabulary learning tasks - learners can build a glossary of words and asked to demonstrate their memory through vocabulary tests and/or quizzes on ' Blooket ' / ' Kahoot ' / ' Quizlet ' or similar software. • Reading comprehension tasks - learners can show their understanding of the French text through a variety of question types. For example, multiple choice, true or false, find the French for… translation, answer the questions in Cymraeg/English. • Recall tasks - learners can demonstrate their knowledge of the chosen work by putting the events in order, matching the character to the statement, summarising key events as a memory dump, spot the odd one out for characters, themes etc. • Oracy tasks - despite being a text-based unit there are opportunities to provide oracy practice through study such as; if this is the answer what is the question, listen to the extract/watch the scene and stand up/raise your hand/show the emotion when you hear… • Writing tasks - when preparing for the final writing assessment tasks familiarise learners with common and complex structures with sentence building, gap fill, write out the acronym, What A Good One Looks Like modelling, spot the difference error checking, re-drafting.   |

| Learners will be required to: • study a work in French • demonstrate their understanding of the work by responding in French to a task set in Cymraeg/English. | Learners will ultimately need to demonstrate their understanding of the chosen work through short written tasks without support. These tasks will ask for evidence that they are familiar with the content of the chosen work, that they can express their opinion about it, and that they can provide reasons for their opinions. Learners do not necessarily need to understand the text in its entirety to achieve this. Practitioners may choose to use parallel or tangled texts, watch a film with sub-titles or voiceover, and / or provide supporting resources in English / Cymraeg whilst studying the work. In preparation for the final NEA individual notes can include the following sub-headings to provide opportunity to introduce and re-enforce knowledge of basic core vocabulary (this list is provided as an example only and is not exhaustive): • Characters - physical appearance, personality, age (numbers), colours. • Locations - weather, places in town, countries • Events - time, days, food, leisure, activities, routine. • Consider providing opportunities to discuss the following questions: • Can you briefly explain what happens, to someone else? • Can you describe the key character(s)?/events?/location(s)? • What did you like? Why? What specific example can you give from the text? • What didn't you like? Why? What specific example can you give from the text? |

| • Do you have a favourite character?/scene?/chapter? Why? What examples can you give to justify your opinion? • Would you recommend reading/watching this to a friend?/family member? Why? • Are there any similarities between your experience / home / country / culture/interests, and those in the chosen text? What example can you give? • Are there any differences between your experience/home/country/culture /interests, and those in the chosen text? What example can you give?   |

| Local, National & International Contexts | There are many opportunities to include Local, National & International Contexts in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because through them, awareness that languages connect us because of the similarities between our lives and day-to-day activity is highlighted. Learners can understand how their sense of identity can lead to a broader sense of identity in an international context, as they increase their knowledge of French-speaking countries through comparison with Wales and develop empathy towards others in a multi- cultural society. Below are some examples of how Local, National & International Contexts can be embedded into teaching and learning: |
| Local, National & International Contexts | Example Draw comparison between the setting of the chosen text and the local area. Classroom idea: • Make a list of the key vocabulary from text describing the setting. • Create a similar list of vocabulary needed to describe the local area. • Compare both lists. • Provide sentence builder or structure strip for writing task - describing setting, describing local area, expressing opinion about similarities, differences and preference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |



{18}------------------------------------------------



| Research a cultural element from chosen the text. Classroom idea: • Read extract from text. • Create an information guide giving details of the tradition or event that evidences the culture of a French-speaking country. • Choose a local or national tradition or event from Wales. • Create a similar guide recycling key vocabulary and grammatical structures in French. (This could be a speaking or writing activity where learners choose different cultural elements and present their work to others).   |

Classroom idea: • Show or read the example • Provide a WAGOLL (What A Good One Looks Like) answer for modelling • Highlight the ambitious language and complex structures in the model. • Create a similar review about the chosen work, recycling the highlighted structures. Recognise and summarise key points. Classroom idea: • Choose a song that reflects the diversity of the French-speaking world. (There are very current and past well-known singers to choose, from ranging from Aznavour to Stromae). • Listen to the song / watch the video clip. • Divide learners into groups / pairs. • Provide each group of learners with a section of the song. • Learners highlight the verbs and adjectives to extract the main points. • Each group prepares a one sentence about their section • Create a summary of the song as a class. (Learners could choose to read the sentences aloud while others write as a form of dictation) |

| Careers and Work-Related Experiences   | There are many opportunities to include Career and Work-Related Experiences (CWRE) in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because communication is an essential skill that leads to success in the world of work and proficiency in an additional language increases job opportunity in many sectors. Learners can develop confidence and transferable skills in developing fluency in a new language, which in turn leads to a better understanding of their own language and an increased ability to show innovation and tenacity in a work environment. Below are some examples of how CWRE can be embedded into teaching and learning:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Careers and Work-Related Experiences   | Example Prepare an interview based on the chosen work. Classroom idea: • Provide background details about an author / director / actor from the chosen work. • Review question forms in French. • Create a 'podcast' interview where learners prepare the questions that lead to answers taken from the details they have about the author / director / actor from the chosen work. Create a CV for a character from the chosen work. Classroom idea: • Discuss what is needed in a cv / covering letter when applying for a job to co-create a template for the CV (nom / prénom / qualités personnelles / expérience etc.) • Review character notes compiled through the study of the chosen work and complete the CV with relevant information. (This is best as a recall task and could be used as a marketplace lesson where different groups are required to feedback or add to each other's CV's) |

| Reading                              | There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because literacy is the backbone of understanding and communication in a language. Below are some examples of how Literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning: Example As this unit focuses on reading and writing, there will inevitably be ample opportunity to embed reading skills such as narrow reading / gist reading / match up / gap-fill / put in order / spot the error and many more. The following suggestions are only for further inspiration. Read aloud Classroom idea: |



{23}------------------------------------------------



| Writing   | Example As this unit is assessed through writing, there will inevitably be ample opportunity to embed writing skills such as tangled translations / finish the sentence / time travel and many more. The following suggestions are only for further inspiration: Triangle writing frame Classroom idea: • Provide a simple sentence starter in the writing frame. ('1. J'ai lu') • Using key vocabulary and connectives learners extend their answers to include opinions and justification. (J'ai lu /Manon des sources /par Marcel Pagnol /et je pense que / c'est très intéressant / parce que / j'aime l'histoire / mais je le trouve / triste / aussi) Structure strips: • Model the planning of 70 and 130-word responses in writing by providing sentence starters / grammar point, and approximate word count for possible bullet points. (Describe your favourite character, adjective agreement, 20 words / Say why you like this character, opinion phrases and connectives, 30 words / Give an example of something you have read in the chosen work to explain how the character was great, past perfect and imperfect tenses, 20 words)   |

| Understanding the number system helps us to represent and compare relationships between numbers and quantities | There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because the ability to understand number in context as part of text is an essential part of understanding our society. Learners can recognise weights and measures, info graphs and dates for example to have a better understanding of a topic. Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Understanding the number system helps us to represent and compare relationships between numbers and quantities | Example Organise a holiday to the setting of the chosen work. Classroom idea: • Provide a budget for 'race around the world' type adventure to the destination. • Use vocabulary for travel and transport to plan the journey. (sample verbs - voyager / rester / visiter / manger / travailler etc.) • Learners plan the trip within the budget and explain how they will get to the destination / where they will stay / what they will do when they are there.) Arrange to meet up and discuss the chosen work / see a film / do homework / go out to eat, Classroom idea: • Provide role play style prompts to guide a conversation between learners. • Learners can read a bus or train timetable to work out the best time to meet up. • Learners can buy a return or single ticket and work the cheapest route. (This could be writing tasks as short text messages / snaps for the outcome rather than oracy) |

| Creativity and Innovation | There are many opportunities to include Creativity and Innovation in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because learning a new skill through imaginative ways builds confidence and supports wellbeing. Learners can express themselves and experiment with language whilst progressing towards fluency. Below are some examples of how Creativity and Innovation can be embedded into teaching and learning:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Creativity and Innovation | Example Write a poem giving opinions about the chosen work. Classroom idea: • Provide starter sentence related to the chosen work / broad theme (Sample: Ce texte me fait ...) • Create success criteria / rules for the poem (3 stanzas / repetition / no rhyme etc) • Review useful verbs in the infinitive (rire /penser / pleurer / sourire / parler). • Provide a closing sentence starter (alors ... / c'est... ) (Learners could also provide reasons for additional challenge). Create a mini book to review a grammar point. Classroom idea: • Review important structures and vocabulary necessary for describing events in the past. (In this case the imperfect tense and adjectives will be useful.) • Provide a story board for describing part of the chosen work / a day in primary school / a past holiday etc. (pg1. Title image and author, pg2. time date and weather, pg3, who? etc.) • Create a mini book of the events with a key structure on each page. (There will be a cover page, a back page and 6 written pages in total) |

| Critical Thinking and Problem Solving   | There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because it is often through error and review that we learn how to navigate unfamiliar or challenging tasks. Learners will develop resilience and independence through recognising when they need to adapt, re-assess or correct language so that they can understand and communicate effectively. Below are some examples of how Critical Thinking and Problem Solving can be embedded into teaching and learning:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Critical Thinking and Problem Solving   | Example Treasure hunt / Escape room Classroom idea: • Provide learners with tasks to find facts about the chosen work (task 1 wordsearch key vocab / task 2 anagrams character names / task 3 put the sentences in order etc.) • Learners must find the correct response by completing the task correctly before they get the 'clue / code' to move on. Detective 'hotseat' revision activity Classroom idea: • Review questions. • Learners can prepare a list of useful questions as a class activity. • 'Hotseat' individual to pick / be secretly given a character / setting / event / from the chosen work. • The 'detective' can ask questions until they have worked out the answer. (In essence this is a conversation reviewing common vocabulary and structures, however it is adaptable for the purpose of assessing how familiar learners are with the chosen work). |



{29}------------------------------------------------



| Planning and Organisation   | There are many opportunities to include Planning and Organisation in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because they need to meet deadlines and include all requirements for assessment purposes as well as build an organised bank of vocabulary and model answers for recall purposes.

| Planning and Organisation   | Example File / Book organisation Classroom idea: • Ensure each learner understands the specification content. • Provide a learning journey type document to inform learners of what needs to be completed and when. • Encourage learners to check their own progress and ask for support if they haven't completed a unit / task for any reason. Memory bank Classroom idea: • Ask learners to build a bank of work that they are proud of. It is always easier to learn and remember language when it builds confidence and self-esteem. • Encourage them to re-draft so that they always refer back to their best work. |

| Personal Effectiveness   | Example Build up a bank of learnt vocabulary. Classroom idea: • Provide vocabulary lists / Vocabulary targets in each unit • Use starter activity or recall task to assess learners' knowledge of the vocabulary. • Ask learners to keep a 'word bank' of the vocabulary they know and keep adding to it throughout the course. Review written work. Classroom idea: • When providing feedback for a piece of writing ensure learners set a goal for improvement (example: use an additional tense). • Review the work and the goal before beginning another written task. • Ask learners to include their goal task in the writing so that they can take responsibility for their own progression. |
