INTRODUCTION

1.1  Aims

The GCSE French qualification must support learners to:
•  understand the language by developing reading, listening and watching skills
•  communicate clearly, accurately and creatively by developing speaking and

writing skills

•  demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the vocabulary, grammar and

structures of French

•  express themselves in a range of contexts and for different audiences and

purposes

•  contribute to conversations and discussions
•  demonstrate their awareness of the culture and society of the countries and

communities where the language is spoken and make connections with their own
languages and culture.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales’ Approval Criteria.

1.2  Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE French qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales
framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make
progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to
this design are the principles of progression, along with the statements of what
matters and those subject specific skills and concepts outlined in the ‘Designing your
Curriculum’ section of the Languages, Literacy and Communication Area of Learning
and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to
embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral
skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix C provides a simple
mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for
Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for
integrating the learning experiences noted on p.19; the Guidance for Teaching will
include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

The GCSE French qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:

•

supporting the statements of what matters1, giving learners the opportunity to:
•  ensure that knowledge and skills in one language are transferred to and

developed in other languages

•  develop their understanding, empathy and their ability to respond and to

mediate effectively

•  use languages in order to be effective as they interact, explore ideas,

express viewpoints, knowledge and understanding

•  provide them with literary experiences that can engage them as listeners,

viewers, readers, narrators and creators.

GCSE FRENCH 7

•

supporting the principles of progression2 by giving learners the opportunity to:
•
•

build on their linguistic skills
grow holistically in their understanding and purposeful use of languages,
literacy and communication
develop their linguistic repertoire through understanding how their own
languages work
adapt and manipulate language to communicate effectively to a range of
different audiences
develop receptive, interpretive and expressive language skills
transfer existing knowledge and skills into new contexts including the social
and cultural aspects of language.

•

•

•
•

•

supporting the key considerations for language development3 by giving learners
the opportunity to:
•  develop phonological awareness and phonemic awareness
•  continue to progress in all their languages from their different starting points.

The GCSE French qualification will also be based on the following:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

understanding and responding to spoken and written language
identifying messages and drawing conclusions
using knowledge of grammar
translating from the language of study
communicating clearly and effectively in speaking and in writing
an everyday 4language list
a core vocabulary list based on high frequency and high utility vocabulary5
using accurate pronunciation and intonation
using knowledge of cultural and regional familiarity.

All units will be based on the following broad themes:

•
•
•

language for leisure and wellbeing
language for travel
language for study and work.

The vocabulary in this specification is transferable across the three broad themes. It
will allow teachers to deliver the vocabulary through their own engaging and
motivating topics, using language in a natural and reoccurring way. For example,
teachers may wish to include the topics of identity and culture, family, friends and
relationships, and free time for the language for leisure and wellbeing theme; travel,
places in town, environment and sustainability for the language for travel theme;
future plans, higher education and the world of work for the language of work and
study theme. These examples are neither prescriptive nor exhaustive.

3 Languages, Literacy and Communication: Designing your curriculum - Hwb (gov.wales)
4 The role and purpose of the everyday language list is to provide teachers and learners with a useful reference
of what to cover pre-GCSE.
5 The core vocabulary list is made up of items which are frequently used in French as well as being useful for

today’s 14-16 language learners.

GCSE FRENCH 8

1.3  Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is
designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the
conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages
3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills
and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares
learners for life, learning and work.

The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of French at either AS
or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and
worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this
subject.

1.4  Guided learning hours

GCSE French has been designed to be delivered within 120 – 140 guided learning
hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for
learners in years 10 and 11.

1.5  Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our
language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect
and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and
adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising
that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to
ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres
of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always
be on the website.

1.6  Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic,
religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible,
features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access
and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual
orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to
enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills
without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the
following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access
Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This
document is available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk).

© WJEC CBAC Ltd 2024.

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of
provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete
barrier to any part of the assessment.

GCSE FRENCH 30

As language is ever changing, the debate is still current at the Académie Française about
the use of more gender neutral and inclusive language. WJEC will not make changes to this
specification but will be accepting of any changes brought about in the future. As a starting
point, gender identification should not be an issue as learners should be using first-person
pronouns or using masculine/feminine nouns. If learners choose to speak in the third-person,
they must be consistent in their pronoun choices, for example, use of ‘iel/ielle’ should not be
seen as grammatically incorrect if the learner is consistently using the chosen pronoun
throughout their speaking. Please be mindful of learners’ choices in assessing all work.
When discussing another individual in the third person where gender or gender preference is
unknown or undisclosed, WJEC expects consistent application of the gender agreement of
the learner’s choice.
