{8}------------------------------------------------

# Assessment details

# **Unit 1 – Oracy**

The assessment lasts for 7–10 minutes

Preparation time: 10 minutes

30% of qualification

60 marks

This unit requires learners to speak using clear and comprehensible French to:

- read aloud a short sentence and participate in a role play
- give a presentation, prepared in advance, based on their own interest and take part in a short unprepared discussion relating to the presentation
- take part in a short unprepared conversation.

The rubrics and stimuli will all be in Cymraeg/English (except for the read aloud task). The language of response will be in the assessed language.

**Candidates are not permitted to use a dictionary in any part of the assessment. The assessment must be submitted digitally.**

# **Task 1: Read aloud and role play (11 marks)**

Candidates can make notes on one-side of A4 paper for the read aloud and role play during the preparation time (the notes will not be marked as part of the assessment).

# **Task 1a: The read aloud**

The candidate will begin by reading aloud the short sentence in French to demonstrate their understanding of sound-spelling correspondence.

### **Task 1b: The role play**

The role play contains **four** interactions. The teacher will start the role play, they are not required to read out the scenario to the candidate and **must not** rephrase the prompts. Candidates may refer to notes to support them with the read aloud and the role play which must be given to the teacher immediately after the assessment.

During the role play, learners will:

- respond appropriately to questions or statements as prompted by the bullet points on the role play card
- formulate a question.

Learners should be able to demonstrate their understanding of the assessed language through their responses in a range of different settings to include the following:

- train/bus station
- tourist information office
- cinema/theatre/venue
- campsite/hostel/hotel
- pharmacy/doctor's surgery/hospital
- leisure centre
- shops
- café/restaurant
- in the home
- in town.

{9}------------------------------------------------

Candidates should be able to engage in transactions including asking and answering questions, asking for advice, making a complaint, reporting a problem, explaining, describing, giving reasons and expressing opinions. The scenario will provide candidates with guidance and prompts in Cymraeg/English on the responses that are required.

**Total time for read aloud and role play: 2 minutes Total marks: 11**

**(AO2 – 8 marks) (AO3 – 3 marks)**

# **Task 2: Presentation and Discussion**

# **Task 2a**

Candidates will:

- give an oral presentation in which they communicate information, describe and narrate events. The presentation may be prepared two weeks in advance of the first timetabled assessment. The presentation can be on a subject of the candidate's choosing which falls within one of the following three broad themes:
  - Theme 1: language for leisure and wellbeing
  - Theme 2: language for travel
  - Theme 3: language for work and study.

Candidates will be marked on:

- communicating information, describing, and narrating events (AO1)
- using generally accurate pronunciation and intonation in order to communicate with a speaker of the language (AO3).

# **Marks: (AO1 – 6 marks) (AO3 – 3 marks)**

Candidates may prepare their presentation two weeks prior to the first timetabled assessment.

Candidates are not permitted to use a dictionary in the preparation of their presentation. Candidates may refer to prepared bullet points to support them with the delivery of their presentation [max. 30 words], complete and continuous sentences are not permitted. The bullet points must be given to the teacher immediately after the presentation (the bullet points will not be marked as part of the assessment).

#### **Task 2b**

Candidates will:

- take part in an **unprepared** discussion relating to the presentation in the present, past
- and future tenses. Teachers will lead the discussion by asking questions relating to the
- presentation. The teacher may repeat or rephrase questions that the candidate does not understand.
- Teachers should provide opportunities for candidates to:
  - give clear responses to the questions they are asked (AO1)
  - use a variety of vocabulary, grammatical structures and different timeframes accurately (AO3).

Candidates may refer to prepared bullet points [max 30 words], to support them with the delivery of their presentation. The bullet points must be given to the teacher immediately after the presentation.

**Marks: (AO1 – 10 marks) (AO3 – 5 marks)**

The presentation should last **no longer than 1 minute.**

{10}------------------------------------------------

The discussion should last between **2-3 minutes.**

**Total time for presentation and discussion: 3-4 minutes. Total marks for presentation and discussion: 24 marks (AO1 – 16 marks) (AO3 – 8 marks)**

#### **Task 3: Conversation**

Candidates will contribute to a conversation based on one of the 3 broad themes.

The conversation should be based on a different broad theme to the one chosen for the presentation. Teachers must inform candidates of the allocated broad theme for the conversation at the start of the 10 minutes preparation time.

The conversation should be based on the broad theme that has not been covered in the presentation and the role play, so that all three broad themes are covered in the Unit 1 NEA.

Candidates can make notes on one-side of A4 paper on the theme of the conversation during the preparation time (the notes will not be marked as part of the assessment).

The purpose of this element of the task is to encourage the candidate to demonstrate what language they know. In order to do this, teachers should provide opportunities for candidates to:

- give clear responses to the questions they are asked (AO1)
- develop their responses as far as they are able (AO1)
- express ideas and opinions
- use a variety of vocabulary, grammatical structures and different timeframes accurately (AO3).

Candidates may refer to notes made on the theme of the conversation during the preparation time which must be given to the teacher immediately after the assessment.

# Questioning technique:

- Teachers should avoid asking prepared questions and should instead build a conversation based on individual candidate responses.
- Questions should ideally be succinct so that there is less teacher talk and more candidate talk.
- Closed questions, which generally lead to yes/no answers, should be followed-up with an opportunity to express opinions or give more information (prompted, for example, by '*Pourquoi* ?' Or '*Pourquoi pas* ?').
- Where possible, more open questions should be used in order to allow the candidate to offer more information/more developed responses.
- Useful question openers for extended answers could be '*Parle-moi de*…', '*Décrismoi*…'or '*Que penses-tu de*…?' for example.

**Total time for conversation: 2-4 minutes Total marks: 25 marks**

**(AO1 – 20 marks) (AO3 – 5 marks)**

Teachers should tailor the complexity of the questions to the ability of the candidate. Questions may be repeated or rephrased during this part of the task. The teacher should use their judgement as to when to move on if a candidate does not understand or respond to a question even after rephrasing. In order to sustain conversation and avoid long silences, it is better to move to a different question to encourage the candidate to keep

{11}------------------------------------------------

talking. Candidates should be given the opportunity to respond in the present, past and future tenses.

Candidates may refer to notes to support them with the theme of the conversation which must be given to the teacher immediately after the assessment.

When asking questions Teachers should use the different areas of the broad theme as well as the candidate's interests and experiences to continue the conversation. Candidates should be given the opportunity to respond in the present, past and future tenses.

# **Allocation of Role play cards:**

The allocation of cards for the role play will be generated by the candidate's choice of broad theme for the presentation.

If the candidate's choice of presentations is from Theme 1, they must be allocated a role play from Theme 2. If the candidate's choice of presentations is from Theme 2, they must be allocated a role play from Theme 1. If the candidate's choice of presentations is from Theme 3, they may be allocated a role play from either Theme 1 or Theme 2.

There will be six role plays for Theme 1 and six role plays for Theme 2.

The first candidate must be given either card 1a or card 2a, depending on their choice of presentation. The second candidate must be given the prescribed card from the next row (depending on their choice of presentation), this sequence will continue for each teacher (not by the centre as a whole). After breaks in testing (including lunchtime and overnight) the sequence should continue. For example, if candidate 3 is tested before a break, the next candidate will be candidate 4. Teachers must follow this prescribed order.

| Candidate<br>Order | Theme 1<br>Presentation | Theme 2<br>Presentation | Theme 3<br>Presentation |
|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1                  | 2a                      | 1a                      | 1a                      |
| 2                  | 2b                      | 1b                      | 2b                      |

| 4                  | 2d                      | 1d                      | 2d                      |
| 5                  | 2e                      | 1e                      | 1e                      |
| 6                  | 2f                      | 1f                      | 2f                      |
| 7                  | 2d                      | 1d                      | 2f                      |
| 8                  | 2a                      | 1f                      | 1b                      |
| 9                  | 2b                      | 1a                      | 2c                      |

{12}------------------------------------------------

| 10 | 2e | 1e | 1d |
|----|----|----|----|
| 11 | 2f | 1c | 2e |
| 12 | 2c | 1b | 1a |

The allocation of role plays is designed to ensure that the assessment experienced by each candidate samples a range of vocabulary from the vocabulary list.

Please note the allocation order will change each year.

# **Task setting**

Tasks are set by WJEC. The assessment will be carried out by teachers at the centre, audio recorded and marked by external examiners. The role play cards will be sent to the Examinations Officer at the centre in a secure pack. Each centre will receive two packs. There will be instructions not to open the package until the specified date. Each candidate will be allocated one card. The list allocating the card to each candidate is shown above. The teacher must ensure that each candidate is assessed with the correct card. Teacher prompts for the role play, and guidance on setting questions for the discussion and conversation are provided below. The Teacher may open the packs up to three working days in advance of the first assessment date at the centre.

Centres must keep a record of the schedule (including dates) on which the assessments are conducted on the declaration form. This form is for the centre and candidates to sign and declare that assessments have been conducted according to the requirements in the Assessment Pack and this must be submitted to WJEC with the audio recordings. Audio files should be uploaded to the WJEC Portal within 48 hours or two working days of the speaking assessments taking place.

#### **Task taking**

Each candidate will have a preparation time of ten minutes prior to the commencement of the assessment. This preparation time must be supervised by an exam invigilator organised by the centre and who is not a subject specialist.

Candidates are not permitted to use dictionaries in any part of the assessment, including the preparation time.

Candidates are advised to spend their 10 minutes preparation time, practising the readaloud sub-vocally, making notes on what to say in the role play and conversation and of course, practising their presentation.

The candidate may bring prepared bullet points [maximum 30 words] to support with the delivery of the presentation into the assessment. During the preparation time, the candidate may, if they wish, make notes on the read aloud and role play, and the allocated theme of the conversation on one-side of A4 paper and refer to these during the assessment. The teacher must check the notes prior to the commencement of the assessment and remove the bullet points from the candidate if they contain complete and continuous sentences. Otherwise, the notes must be handed to the teacher at the end of the test, along with the role play. After the preparation period of 10 minutes, the teacher must ensure that the candidate spends the following times on each task:

{13}------------------------------------------------

# **Approximate timings for oral assessment**

| Task                        | Approximate timings      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Role play                   | 2 minutes                |
| Presentation and discussion | 1 minute and 2-3 minutes |
| Conversation                | 2-4 minutes              |

The timing for the read aloud and role play is approximately 2 minutes but this will depend on each candidate. The timing for the presentation, discussion and conversation should be adhered to so that the candidate is able to access the full range of marks. The overall timings must be adhered to and any speaking evidence that exceeds these timings will not be marked.

# **Conducting the assessment**

Candidates will be allowed one attempt at the assessment. Once the recording begins it cannot be paused or stopped until the end of the assessment. The only circumstances in which a candidate can be re-tested are if there is a technical malfunction during the assessment (so that, for example, the assessment has not been recorded or is inaudible) or an incident occurs beyond the teacher's control which prevents the completion of the assessment. In any such circumstance, the teacher must inform WJEC immediately via the Examinations Officer at the centre. WJEC will then inform the centre which role play to use in place of the original allocation.

Detailed instructions regarding the process for submitting the materials will be communicated to centres through Examination Officers.

When introducing each candidate, the following convention must be used: Specification / centre number / candidate number / candidate name / role play card / presentation theme / conversation theme / date.

# Unit 1 Teacher Guidance

#### <span id="page-13-2"></span><span id="page-13-1"></span><span id="page-13-0"></span>Oracy Speaking and Listening **Content Amplification Teacher Guidance** Oracy Speaking and Listening Learners should be able to: • develop their listening skills to understand and respond to different types of spoken language in a range of different contexts • use their knowledge of grammar and vocabulary to support their understanding including the relationship between the past, present and future tenses • communicate and interact clearly and effectively for different purposes • communicate information, ideas and opinions in a variety of contexts • use their knowledge of vocabulary and grammar to communicate meaningfully • reference past, present and future events where appropriate • use more complex structures where appropriate • use generally accurate pronunciation and intonation. • You should provide learners with opportunities to listen and respond to questions across the 3 themes on a regular basis. Ensure learners are familiar with question words in French and are able to formulate questions themselves. You may wish to establish hot-seating sessions on particular aspects of each theme where learners both devise and answer questions asked by other class members, such as the topic of *my favourite holiday destination*. • Activities such as matching questions and answers in French, providing an answer and asking the learners to formulate the question, 'what am I?' and 'guess who?' can help develop proficiency in listening and speaking. Such activities could be tailored to different contexts and themes and would allow learners to respond to what they hear as well as allowing them opportunities to read aloud. • Ensure candidates understand the 'tu' and 'vous' form of verbs to support them in responding to role play tasks and that they have the opportunity to practise using these in role play phrases and questions. Tasks where learners choose the right form based on the person and situation may be useful – e.g., responding to the headteacher, a friend, an elderly neighbour. • You may wish to teach patterns for the past, present and future tenses individually at first. Once learners are confident with the formation of each one, you could explicitly compare written tense patterns and sound patterns so they are aware of similarities and

{15}------------------------------------------------

differences and become adept at distinguishing between these. In either their reading or listening work, you could present learners with a range of sentences and ask them to identify the tense based on the writing/sound patterns they know. Attention should also be given to time markers. Learners could, for example, categorise a range of time markers into past/present/future from what they hear or read. It may be helpful over time to create banks of questions and responses in different tenses to ask for advice/information etc.

- Support candidates to develop a bank of useful opinions and complex phrases which they are confident in using, through including these in starter tasks – for example, categorise the phrases into sentence starter/opinion/reason and consider creating cross topic knowledge organisers from which learners can select a range of phrases.
- It is important that learners are aware that grammatical structures and vocabulary are transferable from one theme to another. To practise this, you could provide learners with specific grammatical structures/vocabulary and challenge them to create as many sentences as possible with these on any theme. Structures could include key phrases such as *il y a*, *je pense que*, *cependant* to encourage learners to think across themes. The task could be differentiated to be in the past, present or future tense or a combination of these.
- You may wish to use photos/images as stimulus for learners to create questions on a regular basis. Again, these may not be linked to a particular theme but would encourage learners to draw upon and recycle questions words and structures learned through one theme in a new context.

{16}------------------------------------------------

- Supporting learners to communicate ideas and opinions could be achieved through activities such as mini debates where learners provide opinions and justifications on different discussion points from across themes, for example, *everyone should play a sport*. You may also wish to ask learners to report back on a topic they have researched where they provide both information and opinions. Providing a list of sentence starters with opinion phrases such as *je pense que*, à mon avis, *selon moi* would be helpful for learners to refer to during such oral activities and to keep as a future reference.
- To enable learners to develop accurate pronunciation and intonation, sound-spelling correspondence rules should be taught explicitly and then practised on a regular basis. Learners should have opportunities to read aloud from a range of material so that they consolidate patterns and develop confidence. It would be helpful to provide learners with a reference list of common sound-spelling correspondence rules to which they could refer as they read aloud, for example, when working in pairs, so that they can reflect upon and improve each other's pronunciation. Other activities which would support learners to consider sound-spelling correspondence include listening to songs and completing gap-fill activities, or the teacher mispronouncing words that learners are reading and asking learners to spot the mistake.

{17}------------------------------------------------

Learners should be able to demonstrate their understanding of French through their responses in a range of different settings to include the following:

- train / bus station
- tourist information office
- cinema / theatre / venue
- campsite / hostel / hotel
- pharmacy / doctor's surgery / hospital
- leisure centre
- shops
- café / restaurant
- in the home
- in town.

you may wish to set vocabulary learning tasks on online using language learning sites such as ['Memrise'](https://www.memrise.com/) or ['Quizlet'](https://quizlet.com/gb). Online activities such as ['Kahoot'](https://kahoot.it/) and ['Blooket'](https://www.blooket.com/) can also be used as wholeclass vocabulary learning activities for specific themes.

• In order to develop learners' vocabulary to speak in different settings,

• It is important that learners can use the *tu* and *vous* forms of address and they should have opportunities in role play practice to use both of these to form questions and provide information. They may wish to write conversations between themselves and figures in authority such as their headteacher or the prime minister to practise formulating the *vous* form of address.

Learners should be able to engage in transactions including:

- asking and responding to questions
- asking for advice
- making a complaint
- reporting a problem
- explaining, describing and giving reasons
- expressing opinions.

• It would be helpful to explicitly discuss different question words with learners. This could be done, for example, by asking learners to formulate questions in preparation for an interview with a French speaker. Making learners aware of negative phrases for transactions is also advisable, for example*, il n'y a pas de…, je n'ai pas de…*Opinion phrases such as *je pense que/je crois que/* à *mon avis/selon moi and c*onjunctions for presenting reasons such as *parce que* and *car* should also be practised explicitly*.* It would be helpful to regularly provide learners with different role play scenarios from across the 3 themes so they can practise using this language.

{18}------------------------------------------------

Learners will be required to:

- participate in a role play
- give a presentation, prepared in advance, based on their own interest and take part in a short unprepared discussion relating to the presentation
- take part in a short unprepared conversation.

- Learners may wish to write and perform their own role plays around contexts from theme one (language for leisure and wellbeing) and theme two (language for travel), the two themes from which the transactional settings for role plays will be drawn. Learners could be asked as a starter activity to prepare the answer to one written bullet point and then to read this to a partner/the class for feedback. Question phrases could also be practised in this way and taken from any of the 2 themes that role plays are set in so that learners are aware that these structures are transferable across themes.
- Learners should have regular opportunities to present to others in a range of contexts. You may wish to begin with learners presenting a few sentences on a subject that they have researched. Initially, this could be carried out in pairs/groups and with visual support such as a PowerPoint or Sway. Presentations could also be encouraged in the style of a podcast on aspects such as a typical dish from a Frenchspeaking country, or a learner's favourite music group.
- In preparation for the Unit 1 examination, learners should also have regular practice devising bullet points to support their presentations. You may wish to take an example presentation and discuss explicitly with the class what the key points are that would formulate the bullet points and how these would best help them to remember the structure of their work. Learners could then carry out this activity for other exemplar presentations before devising bullet points for their own work.
- It would also be helpful if learners became accustomed to anticipating the sorts of questions that might be asked about their presentations. Again, this could initially be done as a whole-class activity with consideration given to the 5Ws that they may be familiar with from their study of English.

{19}------------------------------------------------

- You could also encourage learners to formulate a follow-up question each to ask to peers who are presenting to the class on different topics. As well as helping them to predict questions, this will also help develop learners' listening skills.
- A key consideration for the unprepared conversation is to remind learners that the grammatical structures and vocabulary they learn across the 3 themes can be transferred and recycled in different contexts. Learners should be given regular opportunities to convey information, describe and narrate events across the 3 themes and to develop their responses by providing opinions and reasons. Learners could, for example, participate in an interview-style activity where they are a famous celebrity, and their partner asks them unseen questions from one or more of the themes. Discussion with learners around the preparation of questions for such activities would be crucial and it would be important to highlight that questions should be designed to allow learners to respond in different tenses and to develop their answers as fully as possible.
- It may be helpful to devise a bank of sample questions for learners across the 3 themes which include opportunities for expression in the past, present and future tenses. These questions should not be exhaustive but would provide useful practice for candidates on the sort of questions they could be asked. Tense work could also be practised, for example, by asking learners to change a conversation about the future into the past by changing tenses and time markers.

# <span id="page-19-0"></span>Learning Experiences

Learners should be encouraged to consider the following learning experiences and skills to further develop their understanding, appreciation and awareness of the subject content. Information in the table below provides opportunities for teachers to integrate the learning experiences into delivery.

#### **Learning Experience Exemplification of Learning Experience** learn about the culture and society in the countries and communities where the international language is spoken • For Theme 1 you may wish to ask learners to research a singer from a French-speaking country/community. They could listen to their music and plan and present a brief presentation about them, for example, their background, their music, their popularity. This would allow learners to use a range of vocabulary and structures that can also be applied to other themes and units. It would provide them with practice of arranging their ideas in a logical order and developing bullet points that will best support them when speaking. As an extension to this, other learners could prepare questions to ask. This would allow for the teaching of question structures and allow the presenter to practise responding spontaneously on a familiar topic. • For Theme 2 you could ask learners to choose a holiday destination in a French-speaking country. They could devise and read aloud a list of questions that you would ask the travel agent about their holiday. You could then develop this activity into a role play where one partner asks the questions and the other partner answers based on the information about the country that they have discovered in their research. • For Theme 3 you could ask learners to explore aspects of school life in a French-speaking country. They could, for example, consider the structure of the school day, school rules in that country, subjects studied, how/when learners are assessed. In groups, they could present their information orally having discussed what they perceive to be the positive and negative aspects of the school system and sorted them into bullet point lists. explore the cross-cutting themes of human rights and diversity, including Black, Asian and minority ethnic perspectives, identity, culture and contributions • You may wish to ask learners to watch extracts of the film *Le Havre* to gain familiarity with the characters of Idrissa and Marcel. Following this, learners could compile a fact-file on the characters, including information such as their physical description, personality, feelings and current situation. In groups, they could present this information orally and record their presentations for the rest of the class to view. • Learners could listen to extracts of French Caribbean popular music. You could ask them to rank them in order of preference with reasons. Learners could then choose their favourite and write and record an audio introduction for a radio show explaining who the artist is, information about the background of their music, why the learner would like to play their song etc. [A Guide to French Caribbean Popular Music | Bandcamp Daily](https://daily.bandcamp.com/scene-report/french-caribbean-popular-music-list)

#### **Cross-cutting Themes**

**There are many opportunities to include Local, National & International Contexts and Sustainability in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because they allow learners to develop their curiosity about the French language and French-speaking cultures as well as gaining an understanding of the importance of international languages. It will help them to gain their own sense of linguistic and cultural identity within their own community and the wider world. Study of local, national and international context in Theme 2 will also give them a greater awareness of environmental issues and potential solutions.**

<span id="page-22-0"></span>Local, National & International Contexts and Sustainability

**Below are some examples of how Local, National & International Contexts and Sustainability can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### *Example*

- Learners could explore environmental issues and sustainability within Theme 2. Learners could, for example, research and provide a short presentation on recycling in a French-speaking country and compare this with their own area. This could be supported by a PowerPoint/Sway/photos/video.
- Learners could identify the advantages and disadvantages of public transport in their own country and a French-speaking country. They could consider aspects such as types of transport, cost, reliability. They could discuss this in pairs with the help of sentence starters to structure their conversations.

# **Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy**

Understanding the number system helps us to represent and compare relationships between numbers and quantities

**There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because they support learners to analyse numbers and the information they provide in real-life situations.**

**Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

# *Example*

- As part of Theme 2, learners could analyse statistics which show the environmental impact of a local initiative and prepare bullet point sentences to share with the class as feedback.
- Within Theme 3, learners could read an article containing statistics about unemployment in the local area and present their findings in French. Learners could be provided with sentences starters to support their speaking work.

# **Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competency**

**There are many opportunities to include Digital Competency in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because they support learners to be collaborative communicators**

**Below are some examples of how Digital Competency can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

# Interacting and Collaborating

#### *Example*

Learners could engage in a series of video-conferencing sessions with school pupils in a Frenchspeaking country to provide information about themselves across the 3 Themes. Learners could develop an oracy project with school pupils in a French-speaking country. Learners would make use of online technology to share and present ideas to others. Their project could be based around exploring each other's locality, for example, or finding out about how their school day and study is structured.

# Planning and Organisation

**There are many opportunities to include Planning and Organisation in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because learners will learn to plan information and ideas in a logical order and to reflect on and make improvements to their speaking work. They will learn to manage the timing of their speaking work and identify prompts and bullet points which will best support them in their speaking presentations.**

**Below are some examples of how Planning and Organisation can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### *Example*

Learners could read an example presentation and devise bullet points by identifying which are the most important elements. In pairs, learners could use these bullet points to evaluate how much of the presentation content they can speak about.

Learners could plan a presentation on a topic of their choice by identifying key points, researching important information and ensuring that their presentation contains a variety of language which allows them to communicate information, describe and narrate events. They could then arrange their ideas in a logical order and check that the presentation complies with the time allocation set by their teacher.

{29}------------------------------------------------

**There are many opportunities to include Personal Effectiveness in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because learners will gain confidence and independence in their oracy.**

**Below are some examples of how Personal Effectiveness can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

# *Example*

# Personal Effectiveness

Learners could record a podcast on healthy eating. They could then listen back to their performances in pairs and evaluate the accuracy of their pronunciation by cross-checking with sound-spelling correspondence rules. Learners could identify any sound-spelling correspondence rules which they need to work on further in preparation for their next oral activity.

Learners could write and perform a dialogue on going to the cinema in the present tense. They could then be asked to re-read the conversation but transferring it to the past tense. Following this oral work, learners could review their use of the past tense by referring to their grammar notes to make improvements to the accuracy of their past tense dialogues.
