MARK SCHEME

Guidance for examiners

Generic marking principles

•  Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).

•  Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for
the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the
quality of the candidate responses seen).

•  Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme.
Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

Positive marking

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit
should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of
penalising candidates for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to
achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be
deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied
precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates’ answers. The list is not
exhaustive. The inclusion of ‘Credit any other valid response.’ (or similar instruction) within
mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates’ responses. Credit should be
given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates’ answers.

on a besoin de se concentrer pour écouter un cours ou lire un livre.

Section 3

F1
Cependant, la technologie peut développer des compétences utiles.

Pour éviter ces problèmes, n'oubliez pas de changer d'activité. Il faut bouger au moins trois
fois par jour.

Question 5

Section 1

F1 : Solange : L’année prochaine, je vais choisir l’informatique et une deuxième option.

M1 : Frédéric : Pour mon bac professionnel, je vais choisir les études de commerce.

F1 : Solange : Bon choix - ce sera intéressant !

M1 Frédéric :  Et le stage en entreprise sera la meilleure chose à faire.

Question 6

Section 1:

M1
Vous êtes en France le 21 juin ? Ne manquez pas la fête de la musique !

En 1982, la première fête a été organisée par le gouvernement français. Seulement un
jeune sur deux joue d’un instrument.

Section 2:

M1
Le but de la fête c’est de donner aux jeunes la chance de présenter leur musique au public.
Le festival est international et se déroule dans 120 pays !

Section 3:

M1
On profite de nombreux concerts gratuits et on peut apprécier toutes sortes de musiques
présentées par des amateurs ou même des chanteurs célèbres !

La fête se passe partout en France, donc aucune excuse pour ne pas participer !
