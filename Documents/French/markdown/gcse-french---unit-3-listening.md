## Generic marking principles

- Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
- Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
- Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

## Positive marking

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising candidates for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates' answers. The list is not exhaustive. The inclusion of 'Credit any other valid response. ' (or similar instruction) within mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates' responses. Credit should be given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates' answers.

## Question Answer

4. Listen to this podcast about screen time.

## Section 1

Les écrans posent des problèmes de santé. On n'est pas actif et on mange trop sans faire attention ! On peut avoir mal au dos et mal au cou. Quand on regarde un écran on ferme les yeux moins souvent.

Résultat ? On a les yeux secs et même un mal de tête.

## Section 2

Souvent, les réseaux sociaux montrent des vidéos très courtes et on a des problèmes quand on a besoin de se concentrer pour écouter un cours ou lire un livre.

## Section 3

Cependant, la technologie peut développer des compétences utiles.

Pour éviter ces problèmes, n'oubliez pas de changer d'activité. Il faut bouger au moins trois fois par jour.

{31}------------------------------------------------



## Section 3

F1 : Béatrice : Moi, je voudrais travailler à l'étranger

!

M1 : Lucien : Il faut avoir une vie en dehors du travail comme des passe-temps et garder la forme pour éviter le stress.

## Question 3

## Section 1

## M1

La maison est grande. Cette maison moderne se trouve à la campagne. C'est une maison pour six personnes avec trois chambres. La ville est à quinze minutes en voiture, mais il n'y a pas de bus.

## Section 2

## M1

Le club de voile est tout près.

Le jardin est parfait pour se détendre avec une piscine.

## Question 4

## Section 1

## F1

Les écrans posent des problèmes de santé. On n'est pas actif et on mange trop sans faire attention ! On peut avoir mal au dos et mal au cou. Quand on regarde un écran on ferme les yeux moins souvent.

Résultat ? On a les yeux secs et un mal de tête même.

## Section 2

## F1

Souvent, les réseaux sociaux montrent des vidéos très courtes et on a des problèmes quand on a besoin de se concentrer pour écouter un cours ou lire un livre.

## Section 3

## F1

Cependant, la technologie peut développer des compétences utiles.

Pour éviter ces problèmes, n'oubliez pas de changer d'activité. Il faut bouger au moins trois fois par jour.

## Section 2

M1 : Frédéric

: Pour mon bac professionnel, je vais choisir les études de commerce.

F1 : Solange

M1 Frédéric

:   Et le stage en entreprise sera la meilleure chose à faire.

La fête se passe partout en France, donc aucune excuse pour ne pas participer !
