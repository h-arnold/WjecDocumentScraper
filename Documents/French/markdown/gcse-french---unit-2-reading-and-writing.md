#### Instructions for teachers

<span id="page-6-1"></span>

#### **Selection of work**

Centres must choose a work in French from one of the following genres: graphic novel, short story, film script, novel.

Centres must ensure that the work focuses on **one** of the broad themes:

- Language for leisure and wellbeing
- Language for travel
- Language for work and study.

Example works (centres may choose a different work):

#### **Graphic Novel:**

**Title:** *Asterix et Obelix Chez les Bretons*, Goscinny et Uderzo ISBN: 978-2-01-210140-1 **Broad Theme:** Language for leisure and wellbeing / Language for travel

A classic of Francophone comic culture – this album (#8) describes British culture seen through French eyes – rugby / tea etc. They travel between *le village gaulois* (Brittany) and *Cantium* (Kent) and discover different cultural experiences along the way. The theme of leisure is most evident as it describes differences between British and Gallic customs.

**Title:** *Le tour du monde en 80 jours*, Jules Verne (Biblio-collège) ISBN: 978-2-01-716688-7 **Broad Theme:** Language for travel / Language for leisure and wellbeing

A well-known story by a French author about the adventures of Phileas Fogg travelling around the world and the challenges he encounters along the way. This edition is an illustrated adapted version for younger readers. The theme of travel is strongest as they describe different means of transport and travel, however different events and activities also lean towards leisure.

#### **Short story:**

**Title:** *Petits contes de Brocéliande* ISBN: 978-2-37051-036-5

**Broad Theme:** Language for travel / Language for leisure and wellbeing

A collection of four short stories based on legends from the Broceliande Forest in Brittany. The language and grammar are accessible to younger readers. The main theme is wellbeing, with emphasis on imagination and fantasy, however there are also clear links between Wales and Brittany.

{8}------------------------------------------------

#### **Film transcript:**

**Title:** *Les Choristes*, Christophe Barratier 2004 12A cert

**Broad Theme:** Language for leisure and wellbeing / Language for work

This is a popular movie about a supply teacher who forms a choir in a boarding school for boys. The film deals with the theme of wellbeing, for example relationships and school life. However, leisure (singing) and work (skills and qualities to be a pion / prof / concierge / chef d'orchestre) are also evident.

**Title:** *Bienvenue Chez les Ch'tis*, Dany Boon 2008 12A cert **Broad Theme:** Language for leisure / Language for work and study / Language for travel

This is a comedy which evidences the stereotypes of northern and southern France. There are links with all broad themes as the film shows how characters react in work, leisure and travel.

#### **Novel:**

**Title:** *Le Petit Prince*, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (many editions available and free PDF online)

**Broad Theme:** Language for travel / Language for work and study

This is the most translated French book ever. The novel reflects the theme of wellbeing as it discusses friendships, love and loss, but also the theme of travel as *le petit prince* visits various planets making observations about life and human nature.

**Title:** *Les récrés du Petit Nicolas*, Sempé-Goscinny ISBN: 2-07-039259-7 **Broad Theme:** Language for leisure and wellbeing

This could easily be classed as a series of short stories too because each chapter is a story in its own right. *Les récrés* recounts l*e petit Nicolas'*s experiences at break time in school and describes his leisure activities, friendships and school experiences.

There are many online resources available for the study of any of these example works (with the exception of *Petits Contes de Broceliande*).

#### Information for candidates

The following information has been taken from the [JCQ Information for candidates](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) – non[examination assessments](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) and the [JCQ Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) Use in Assessments:](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/)  [Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/) This tells you about things that you **must** and **must not** do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not understand, you **must** ask your teacher.

#### **Preparing your work**

- When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you need to ensure that your final product reflects your own independent work and isn't copied or paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
- If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you **must** tell your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
- If you worked as part of a group on a task, you **must** each write up your own account of the assignment. Even if the data you have is the same, you **must** describe in your own words how that data was obtained, and you **must** independently draw your own conclusions from the data.
- Take care of your work and keep it safe. **Do not** leave it lying around where your classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You **must** always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; **do not** share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
- **Do not** be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI tools and chatbots) – this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort of copying.
- You **must not** write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

#### **Plagiarism**

Plagiarism involves taking someone else's words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them off as your own. **It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously.** Don't think you won't be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:

- Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
- Markers are highly experienced subject specialists they may have read the source you are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!
- Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and style of writing or punctuation.

#### **Penalties for breaking the regulations**

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be applied:

- the piece of work will be awarded zero marks
- you will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question
- you will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series
- you will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

**Remember – it's your qualification so it needs to be your own work.**

#### **MARK SCHEME**

#### **Guidance for examiners**

#### **Generic marking principles**

- Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
- Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
- Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

#### **Positive marking**

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising candidates for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates' answers. The list is not exhaustive. The inclusion of *'Credit any other valid response.*' (or similar instruction) within mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates' responses. Credit should be given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates' answers.

#### **Banded mark schemes**

For band marked questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in candidates' answers. It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate's response. As noted above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive, and candidates do not have to include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been provided, no marks should be awarded.

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each candidate's response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills, knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors or omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate's answer to pick out the evidence that is being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied. This is done as a two-stage process.

{20}------------------------------------------------

#### **Stage 1 – Deciding on the band**

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate's answer and check whether it matches the descriptors for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the descriptors most closely matches the work.

#### **Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark**

Having determined the appropriate band, deciding on the mark within a band will be made on the basis of a 'best fit' procedure, weaknesses in some areas being compensated for by strengths in others.

Examiners should use the full range of marks available to them. Marking should be positive, rewarding achievement rather that penalising failure or omissions. The awarding of marks must be directly related to the marking criteria, and all responses must be marked according to the banded levels provided for each question.

Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be provided during standardising and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work. Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the standardising material as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the work submitted.

This mark scheme instructs examiners to look for and reward valid alternatives where indicative content is suggested for an answer. This is not a checklist for expected content in an answer, or set out as a 'model answer', as responses must be marked in the banded levels of response provided for each question. Where a candidate provides a response that contains aspects or approaches not included in the indicative content, examiners should use their professional judgement to determine the validity of the response in light of the task and reward as directed by the bands. Candidates are free to choose any approach that is relevant to the set task. Candidates can (and will most likely) incorporate ideas other than those mentioned in the mark scheme.

#### **Glossary of terms**

The following glossary of terms provides guidance on terms used within the banded mark schemes.

Differentiation of descriptors in the mark scheme

The following words are used from top to lower bands in all banded mark schemes:

- consistent(ly) / always / almost always / all / almost all / highly
- main(ly) / most(ly) / often / frequent
- generally
- some / sometimes / occasionally
- basic / little
- limited / few
- minimal / rarely.

Please note that these should be viewed in conjunction with the descriptor as they may not always go from top to lower, for example: frequent errors would be in a lower mark band.

**Assessment Grids** (45 marks)

This task tests the candidate's ability to understand and respond to written language (AO2 – 30 marks). It also tests the candidate's knowledge and accurate application of a range of grammatical structures and vocabulary (AO3 – 15 marks) as specified in the assessment grids below. The number of words is approximate, and all work must be marked. The bullet points are compulsory but equal coverage is not required.

#### **The following Assessment Objectives are tested in task 1a:**

- AO2 Understand and respond to written language in writing
- AO3 Demonstrate knowledge and accurate application of the grammar and vocabulary prescribed in the specification*.*

#### Appendix – Guide to Controls

Unit 2 is internally assessed through NEA. Controls are provided to:

- ensure that all candidates taking a specific qualification spend approximately the same amount of time on their assignments
- prevent third parties from providing inappropriate levels of guidance and input
- mitigate concerns about plagiarism and improve reliability and validity of results
- allow centres an appropriate degree of freedom and control
- allow candidates to produce an original piece of work.

There are a number of different aspects that are controlled within the internal assessment.

#### These are:

- **supervision** how closely candidates should be monitored as they carry out the tasks
- **guidance** how much help you are allowed to provide candidates as they are completing the tasks
- **resources** whether candidates are allowed access to any resources as they're completing the tasks and if so, what resources
- **collaboration**  whether candidates are allowed to work with others as they're completing the tasks.

#### **Supervision**

Unit 2 control the level of supervision is **Direct**. **Please note that this assessment must be taken in one single session and must not exceed the allotted one hour.**
