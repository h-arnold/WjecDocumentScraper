| Listening             | Learners should be able to: • develop their listening skills to understand and evaluate what they hear • demonstrate an understanding of spoken language when listening to one or more speakers in a range of contexts • identify the overall message, key points and opinions in spoken extracts, some involving more complex language, and draw conclusions where appropriate • use knowledge of grammar to support understanding, including recognising the relationship between past, present and future events. | • Learners should be given plenty of opportunities to become very familiar with sound-spelling patterns. For example, learners could pick out the word they hear from a list of similar words. • https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FK4SGlnaSs - has spelling videos which could be used as a revision tool for sound-spelling patterns. • https://www.youtube.com/@TheIdealTeacherLanguageSchool - has a number of videos to help learners improve pronunciation and also GCSE themed videos. • Listening activities with a transcript is a way of building learners' confidence with matching spoken and written language. • Learners also should be able to recognise the tenses they hear. E.g. - pick the correct version of the verb (Je mange, J'ai mangé, Je vais manger etc). This can be done easily and quickly as starter tasks (using mini-whitboards etc), learners write down the verbs they hear. • Also, learners should be able to recognise time markers for the different tenses in sentences - e.g. La semaine dernière/ À l'avenir/ Hier/ Demain etc. • Learners could work in pairs/small groups on listening tasks - e.g. one learner reads aloud an extract the other has to answer questions / complete a grid etc. |



{11}------------------------------------------------



| Learners will be required to: • listen to extracts including the following formats: adverts, messages, podcasts, announcements, conversations interviews • respond to a range of questions in Cymraeg/English.   | and • There are several websites that offer free AI tools (text to speech etc) that can be used to easily generate audio files. • Audio files from past papers can be manipulated to support listening skills. • Learners needs to be familiar with the question types in Unit 3 - multiple choice questions; short answer questions; gap fill; identify true statements; matching statements with their source; finish the sentence. • Using the transcript to help build confidence learners could put the sentences in the correct order; identifying which speaker says what, answer questions in English/Welsh. • There are also several websites that have free videos (e.g. www.1jour1actu.com) of contemporary subjects that are very relevant to this GCSE and Curriculum for Wales. Many videos can have subtitles added automatically and the speed can be adjusted to suit learners' needs • Learners could answer questions on the videos in English/Welsh in order to demonstrate understanding.   |

Any text can be adapted into a listening activity using Text to Speech websites. BBC Bitesize resources have a number of videos etc that explore cultural aspects of France and French speaking countries. • https://www.lumni.fr/video/qui-est-omar-sy - watch the video about French actor Omar Sy, learners could answer questions in English/Welsh to demonstrate understanding of the main points. Gap-fill or multiple-choice questions could also be used with cultural videos of this type where the language may be more challenging.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| explore the cross-cutting themes of human rights and diversity, including Black, Asian and minority ethnic perspectives, identity, culture and contributions | As above all of the cross-cutting themes can be incorporated into the teaching and learning across all of the 3 themes. As mentioned above www.1jour1actu.com has a wealth of videos on these themes eg. ' C'est quoi le racisme?' , as well as several podcasts eg. 'Qu'est-ce que c'est Black Lives Matter?' Many of these resources could be used to pick out main ideas; specific vocabulary; reordering statements etc to make them accessible to all learners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Centres can request visits from Mentors and Student language ambassadors and sessions can be in person or online. • Centres can also apply for funding via Taith - Hwb (gov.wales) to take part in educational international exchanges. There are several groups on social media platforms where schools can connect with schools abroad. • Learners could be encouraged to exchange videos/podcasts etc as a way of connecting directly with French speakers. • There are several films that could be exploited: Les Choristes Le Petit Nicolas Bienvenue Chez les Ch'tis Mystère |

| Interacting and Collaborating                  | Example • There is a wide range of digital tools that can be used in the classroom to enhance learning and listening skills. For example, learners could use www.vocaroo.com to create their own listening materials in pairs (podcast on a specific topic - presenting a Fracophone country, etc). • Use Language learning apps like Duolingo, Babbel, or Quizlet to provide listening exercises and quizzes that learners use to practice comprehension. · • Use interactive websites like LyricsTraining. Learners practise listening skills through French songs, filling in the blanks as they hear the lyrics. • Learners prepare an oral presentation on a specific theme. They can share it digitally with their peers who will listen to the presentation respond to it digitally. • Assign a digital transcription task where learners work together to transcribe an audio/video clip using shared documents or collaborative platforms. Learners can be allocated specific parts of the audio and share their part with the rest of the group to create a complete version. Compare the result with other groups' work. BBC Bitesize has a number of videos that would be suitable for this type of activity. |

Below are some examples of how Planning and Organisation can be embedded into teaching and learning:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Planning and Organisation   | Example • As previously mentioned, giving learners the opportunity to create their own listening tasks can help develop their planning and organisation skills. • Learners need plenty of opportunity to practise exam style questions in order to build confidence, thorough knowledge of the vocabulary lists is also essential. For example - teachers could read out topic specific vocab that learners have to write the meaning of or put into categories, learners could listen to an example of a piece of written work and identify the structures used (tenses/adjectives/connectives etc). • Learners could read and put a transcript in the correct order, prior to listening to the extract. • Learners could identify complex structures and create their own extract using some of the language they have heard. • Learners could be encouraged to watch films/series to encourage independent learning and to help gain confidence in listening skills. |
