| Listening | Learners should be able to: <ul><li>develop their listening skills to understand and evaluate what they hear</li><li>demonstrate an understanding of spoken language when listening to one or more speakers in a range of contexts</li><li>identify the overall message, key points and opinions in spoken extracts, some involving more complex language, and draw conclusions where appropriate</li><li>use knowledge of grammar to support understanding, including recognising the relationship between past, present and future events.</li></ul> | <ul><li>Learners should be given plenty of opportunities to become very familiar with sound-spelling patterns. For example, learners could pick out the word they hear from a list of similar words.</li><li>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FK4SGlnaSs – has spelling videos which could be used as a revision tool for sound-spelling patterns.</li><li>https://www.youtube.com/@TheIdealTeacherLanguageSchool – has a number of videos to help learners improve pronunciation and also GCSE themed videos.</li><li>Listening activities with a transcript is a way of building learners' confidence with matching spoken and written language.</li><li>Learners also should be able to recognise the tenses they hear. E.g. - pick the correct version of the verb (Je mange, J'ai mangé, Je vais manger etc). This can be done easily and quickly as starter tasks (using mini-whitboards etc), learners write down the verbs they hear.</li><li>Also, learners should be able to recognise time markers for the different tenses in sentences – e.g. La semaine dernière/ À l'avenir/ Hier/ Demain etc.</li><li>Learners could work in pairs/small groups on listening tasks – e.g. one learner reads aloud an extract the other has to answer questions / complete a grid etc.</li></ul> |  |

{10}------------------------------------------------

#### Learners will be required to:

- listen to extracts including the following formats: adverts, messages, podcasts, announcements, conversations and interviews
- respond to a range of questions in Cymraeg/English.
- There are several websites that offer free AI tools (text to speech etc) that can be used to easily generate audio files.
- Audio files from past papers can be manipulated to support listening skills.
- Learners needs to be familiar with the question types in Unit 3 multiple choice questions; short answer questions; gap fill; identify true statements; matching statements with their source; finish the sentence.
- Using the transcript to help build confidence learners could put the sentences in the correct order; identifying which speaker says what, answer questions in English/Welsh.
- There are also several websites that have free videos (e.g. [www.1jour1actu.com\)](http://www.1jour1actu.com/) of contemporary subjects that are very relevant to this GCSE and Curriculum for Wales. Many videos can have subtitles added automatically and the speed can be adjusted to suit learners' needs
- Learners could answer questions on the videos in English/Welsh in order to demonstrate understanding.

# <span id="page-11-0"></span>Learning Experiences

Learners should be encouraged to consider the following learning experiences and skills to further develop their understanding, appreciation and awareness of the subject content. Information in the table below provides opportunities for teachers to integrate the learning experiences into delivery.

| Learning Experience                                                                                                                                                         | Exemplification of Learning Experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| learn about the culture and society in the countries and communities where the international language is spoken | Teachers should seek to incorporate the culture and society of French speaking countries, not only France across all the 3 themes. Any text can be adapted into a listening activity using Text to Speech websites. BBC Bitesize resources have a number of videos etc that explore cultural aspects of France and French speaking countries. <ul><li>https://www.lumni.fr/video/qui-est-omar-sy – watch the video about French actor Omar Sy, learners could answer questions in English/Welsh to demonstrate understanding of the main points. Gap-fill or multiple-choice questions could also be used with cultural videos of this type where the language may be more challenging.</li></ul> |
| explore the cross-cutting themes of human rights and diversity, including Black, Asian and minority ethnic perspectives, identity, culture and contributions | As above all of the cross-cutting themes can be incorporated into the teaching and learning across all of the 3 themes. As mentioned above www.1jour1actu.com has a wealth of videos on these themes eg. 'C'est quoi le racisme?', as well as several podcasts eg. 'Qu'est-ce que c'est Black Lives Matter?' Many of these resources could be used to pick out main ideas; specific vocabulary; reordering statements etc to make them accessible to all learners. |

- Use interactive websites like [LyricsTraining.](https://lyricstraining.com/) Learners practise listening skills through French songs, filling in the blanks as they hear the lyrics.
- Learners prepare an oral presentation on a specific theme. They can share it digitally with their peers who will listen to the presentation respond to it digitally.
- Assign a digital transcription task where learners work together to transcribe an audio/video clip using shared documents or collaborative platforms. Learners can be allocated specific parts of the audio and share their part with the rest of the group to create a complete version. Compare the result with other groups' work. BBC Bitesize has a number of videos that would be suitable for this type of activity.

- Learners could listen to an extract (created by the teacher) that contain a range of phrases/structures that the learners have to identify. E.g. An extract using a variety of tenses or including more complex language or using a range of structures to express opinions (J'estime que/ J'imagine que/ Je dirais que etc).
- Learners could then create their own work including some of the structures they have heard for example, using more adventurous adjectives.
- Interactive quizzes: Using tools like [Kahoot,](https://kahoot.com/) Google Forms, [Blooket](https://www.blooket.com/) or [Quizlet.](https://quizlet.com/gb)
- Learners can create listening comprehension quizzes based on audio/video clips or their own recordings.
