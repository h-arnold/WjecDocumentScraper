| Listening             | Learners should be able to:<br>•<br>develop their listening skills to understand and evaluate<br>what they hear<br>•<br>demonstrate an understanding of spoken language when<br>listening to one or more speakers in a range of contexts<br>•<br>identify the overall message, key points and opinions in<br>spoken extracts, some involving more complex language,<br>and draw conclusions where appropriate<br>•<br>use knowledge of grammar to support understanding,<br>including recognising the relationship between past,<br>present and future events. | •<br>Learners should<br>be given plenty of opportunities to become very<br>familiar with sound-spelling patterns. For example, learners could<br>pick out the word they hear from a list of similar words.<br>•<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FK4SGlnaSs<br>–<br>has spelling<br>videos which could be used as a revision tool for sound-spelling<br>patterns.<br>•<br>https://www.youtube.com/@TheIdealTeacherLanguageSchool<br>–<br>has<br>a number of videos to help learners improve pronunciation<br>and also<br>GCSE themed videos.<br>•<br>Listening activities with a transcript is a way of building learners'<br>confidence with matching spoken and written language.<br>•<br>Learners also should<br>be able to recognise the tenses they hear. E.g.<br>-<br>pick the correct version of the verb (Je mange, J'ai mangé, Je vais<br>manger etc).<br>This can be done easily and quickly as starter tasks<br>(using mini-whitboards etc), learners write down the verbs they hear.<br>•<br>Also,<br>learners should be able to recognise time markers for the<br>different tenses in sentences –<br>e.g.<br>La semaine dernière/ À<br>l'avenir/<br>Hier/ Demain<br>etc.<br>•<br>Learners<br>could work in pairs/small groups on listening tasks –<br>e.g.<br>one learner reads aloud an extract the other has to answer questions<br>/ complete a grid etc. |  |

{11}------------------------------------------------

#### Learners will be required to:

- listen to extracts including the following formats: adverts, messages, podcasts, announcements, conversations and interviews
- respond to a range of questions in Cymraeg/English.
- There are several websites that offer free AI tools (text to speech etc) that can be used to easily generate audio files.
- Audio files from past papers can be manipulated to support listening skills.
- Learners needs to be familiar with the question types in Unit 3 multiple choice questions; short answer questions; gap fill; identify true statements; matching statements with their source; finish the sentence.
- Using the transcript to help build confidence learners could put the sentences in the correct order; identifying which speaker says what, answer questions in English/Welsh.
- There are also several websites that have free videos (e.g. [www.1jour1actu.com\)](http://www.1jour1actu.com/) of contemporary subjects that are very relevant to this GCSE and Curriculum for Wales. Many videos can have subtitles added automatically and the speed can be adjusted to suit learners' needs
- Learners could answer questions on the videos in English/Welsh in order to demonstrate understanding.

# <span id="page-11-0"></span>Learning Experiences

Learners should be encouraged to consider the following learning experiences and skills to further develop their understanding, appreciation and awareness of the subject content. Information in the table below provides opportunities for teachers to integrate the learning experiences into delivery.

listening past papers have questions on this theme and can be manipulated for a range of activities.

- BBC Bitesize has videos and listening materials on this theme; <https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zjbdscw/video> - watch the video discussing work experience. There are comprehension questions, plus the transcript which could be used as a gap-fill or ask learners to highlight different types of words (verbs in present tense; adjectives etc).
- Learners could devise a list of suitable job interview questions to ask a partner and note answers.

# **Cross-curricular Skills – Literacy**

**There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because good literacy skills are essential for language learning.** 

**Below are some examples of how Literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

## *Example*

- Literacy skills are integral to language learning. Learners should have a good understanding of the grammar noted in the specification, they should be able to identify a variety of grammatical structures during any listening activities.
- Learners could pick out specific grammatical structures in a listening extract:
  - Tenses: Present, past, and future tenses. For example, in a listening task about past holidays, learners focus on the use of past tense verbs.
  - Adjectives: Chose the correct form of the adjective (masc/fem/plural) whilst listening to description of family members/friends.
- Gap-fill tasks: Provide transcripts with missing grammatical elements (e.g., verbs, articles, or pronouns) that learners fill in while listening.
- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHXarNJE3ss> Video comprehension with multiple choice questions.
- Learners could pick out vocabulary for a specific theme/topic from a list. Knowledge of the core

# Listening

{19}------------------------------------------------

vocabulary list is essential for success in the listening assessment.

• Learners should be given ample opportunities to develop their knowledge of sound-spelling patterns – e.g. Identifying the correct sound pattern; dictation type activities word and sentence level.

# **Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy**

**There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because Numeracy is encountered in all contexts of everyday life.**

**Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### *Example*

Understanding the number system helps us to represent and compare relationships between numbers and quantities

- Learners could identify times; prices; statistics etc from listening extracts.
- Learners should be familiar with numbers/ times / dates/ years etc on the Everyday Vocabulary list, as well as terms for quantities e.g. un tiers; la moitié; une quinzaine etc.
- Learners could listen to adverts about events for example, identifying times and prices etc.
- Text to speech software could be used to create:
  - announcements of public transport times/price etc.
  - prices of items in shop that learners have to note down.
  - opening times of cinemas/restaurants/shops
- Learners could listen to an extract of the results of a survey, identifying the main findings.

{20}------------------------------------------------

# **Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competence**

**There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners because digital competence can support learners on their language learning journey.**

**Below are some examples of how Digital Competence can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### *Example*

# Interacting and Collaborating

- There is a wide range of digital tools that can be used in the classroom to enhance learning and listening skills. For example, learners could use [www.vocaroo.com](https://www.vocaroo.com/) to create their own listening materials in pairs (podcast on a specific topic – presenting a Fracophone country, etc).
- Use Language learning apps like [Duolingo,](https://www.duolingo.com/) [Babbel,](https://uk.babbel.com/pages/en-gb/evergreen-multilanguage?bsc=bg_br_srh_eng_all&btp=default&utm_campaign=BG_BR_SRH_ct_ENGVAR_MAIN_gEN_cUK&utm_content=427195551_1287528784411689_kwd-80470865053420%3Aloc-188_80470693751215&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=bing&utm_term=babbel) or [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/gb) to provide listening exercises and quizzes that learners use to practice comprehension. ·
- Use interactive websites like [LyricsTraining.](https://lyricstraining.com/) Learners practise listening skills through French songs, filling in the blanks as they hear the lyrics.
- Learners prepare an oral presentation on a specific theme. They can share it digitally with their peers who will listen to the presentation respond to it digitally.
- Assign a digital transcription task where learners work together to transcribe an audio/video clip using shared documents or collaborative platforms. Learners can be allocated specific parts of the audio and share their part with the rest of the group to create a complete version. Compare the result with other groups' work. BBC Bitesize has a number of videos that would be suitable for this type of activity.

# **Integral Skills**

**There are many opportunities to include Creativity and Innovation in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners so they can use language creatively to express opinions, take risks and develop confidence.**

**Below are some examples of how Creativity and Innovation can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

# *Example*

# Creativity and Innovation

- Learners should be able to work creatively across the 3 Themes. By listening to a wide variety of extracts learners can be encouraged to use the language they hear in their own work.
- Learners could listen to an extract (created by the teacher) that contain a range of phrases/structures that the learners have to identify. E.g. An extract using a variety of tenses or including more complex language or using a range of structures to express opinions (J'estime que/ J'imagine que/ Je dirais que etc).
- Learners could then create their own work including some of the structures they have heard for example, using more adventurous adjectives.
- Interactive quizzes: Using tools like [Kahoot,](https://kahoot.com/) Google Forms, [Blooket](https://www.blooket.com/) or [Quizlet.](https://quizlet.com/gb)
- Learners can create listening comprehension quizzes based on audio/video clips or their own recordings.
- Create a podcast: Learners work individually or in groups to create a podcast episode on a given theme. They must include key vocabulary and grammatical structures. Peers exchange and listen to their podcasts.

{22}------------------------------------------------

**There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners so they can develop their understanding of how to communicate effectively in a variety of situations.**

**Below are some examples of how Critical Thinking and Problem Solving can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### *Example*

# Critical Thinking and Problem Solving

- Learners should be able to develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills across the 3 Themes
- Learners could listen to an extract, then put the transcript in the correct order; listen for meaning and form assumptions from what they hear etc.
- Learners could use their translanguaging skills to summarise what they hear in English/Welsh.
- Choosing correct statements is often a challenging activity, learners should have ample opportunity to develop the problem-solving skills for these types of activities.
- For example <https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zsstrmn/articles/zpxkxg8#zgcgqyc> learners could watch the video of a day out in Orleans and the create tasks in pairs to swap with another pair.
- Learners could also create their own audio files using Text to Speech software then devise their own tasks for a partner to complete.

{23}------------------------------------------------

**There are many opportunities to include Planning and Organisation in GCSE French. These opportunities are important to Learners so they can develop their understanding of how to improve their work through planning, organisation and reflection.**

**Below are some examples of how Planning and Organisation can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### *Example*

# Planning and Organisation

- As previously mentioned, giving learners the opportunity to create their own listening tasks can help develop their planning and organisation skills.
- Learners need plenty of opportunity to practise exam style questions in order to build confidence, thorough knowledge of the vocabulary lists is also essential. For example – teachers could read out topic specific vocab that learners have to write the meaning of or put into categories, learners could listen to an example of a piece of written work and identify the structures used (tenses/adjectives/connectives etc).
- Learners could read and put a transcript in the correct order, prior to listening to the extract.
- Learners could identify complex structures and create their own extract using some of the language they have heard.
- Learners could be encouraged to watch films/series to encourage independent learning and to help gain confidence in listening skills.
