Aims of the Delivery Guide

The aim of the Delivery Guide is to give an overview of the qualification and to help teachers
understand how we assess the GCSE. It will offer an introduction to the specification, an
assessment overview, and will support teachers in better understanding how to prepare their
learners for the assessment of the different units. More information on each unit can be
found in the separate unit guides.

As this is an international languages qualification, it carries over many other similarities to
GCSE German and GCSE Spanish.  As such, ideas that could be incorporated into teaching
and learning, can be found in the Guidance for Teaching documents for these qualifications,
and we encourage teachers to research these documents for further guidance.

Themes and the Use of Language

The following diagram shows example topics that could be used within all of the three broad
themes.

It is important for teachers to ensure that all topics and associated vocabulary are
transferable across all three themes and should not be used solely in one theme. The
examples given are neither prescriptive, nor exhaustive and teachers can and should,
deliver the vocabulary through their own engaging and motivating topics, using language in a
natural and reoccurring way.

Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:
•  Specification – this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to

know by the end of their course.

•  Assessment Pack –  this contains the Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) i.e: sample
exam papers and sample NEA tasks, relevant controls for the NEA and mark schemes

This guide builds upon the information in the specification and assessment pack to help
further your understanding of said documents.

Understanding the specification amplification

Learners should be made aware of:
