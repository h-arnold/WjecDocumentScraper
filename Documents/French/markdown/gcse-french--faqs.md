{2}------------------------------------------------

# Resources

## **Q: Is an accompanying textbook being developed? Are existing textbooks being reviewed in line with the new specification?**

A: We are not affiliated with textbook providers and cannot comment on their plans for reviewing textbooks. We are creating a series of Blended Learning resources which will be available online in the summer term of 2025 and we will provide more information on the content of these at "Prepare to Teach" events.

## **Q: Will revision guides be made available?**

A: There are currently no plans for the WJEC to produce revision guides. Blended learning resources and Knowledge Organisers aimed at learners, will be available in the summer term 2025.

# Unit 2

## **Q: If centres chose their own work (not one of the works suggested by WJEC), will works need to be agreed with WJEC? How will centres know if the work they chose is acceptable/not deemed too easy?**

A: There is no formal approval process, as centres are at liberty to choose a work of their choice. The content of the work should, however, be enough to allow candidates to write 200 words on it over the two tasks of the NEA.

## **Q: Will teachers have access to the Unit 2 NEA before the candidates undertake the assessment?**

A: Centres may download the Unit 2 NEA three working days in advance of the first assessment date at the centre.

## **Q: Do teachers set the Unit 2 task about the chosen work?**

A: No. The task will be set by the WJEC. It will change from year to year but will broadly cover the following areas: plot, themes, characters, positive and negative aspects, setting and summary. The task will be generic enough to to allow the assessment of candidates' understanding of any chosen work.

## **Q: Can centres teach their chosen work before the specified NEA period in March of Year 11?**

A: Centres are free to introduce their chosen work to learners at any time during the allocated learning hours for the qualification, or even before (in year 8 or 9).

## **Q: Will there be any free resources available for Unit 2?**

A: Some free resources of the suggested works are available. These will be detailed in the "Preparing to Teach" events. This is not the case however for all works. Where free resources are not available, it is the responsibility of the centre to cover the cost of the work they choose for their learners to study.

## **Q: Will ISBN numbers of the suggested works be provided?**

A: We will provide ISBN numbers for all suggested works at the "Preparing to Teach" events.

# Unit 3

## **Q: In the Unit 3 listening examination, will songs be used to assess candidates' listening skills?**

A: For unit 3, candidates will be required to listen to extracts which may include but will not be limited to the following formats: adverts, messages, podcasts, announcements, phone conversations and interviews. Principal Examiners may therefore choose to include songs within unit 3 to assess candidates' listening skills.

# Unit 4

## **Q: In the Unit 4 translation task, will learners lose marks for accidentally translating non-underlined text?**

A: No, learners will not lose marks for accidentally translating the text that is not underlined. However, they will only be awarded marks for translating the underlined words. The translation question is presented as the whole text with the sections to be translated underlined. Underneath the text, where candidates write their responses, the sections of the text to be translated are repeated, with space below for the candidate's response. The rubrics for all questions in all units of this specification are in English/Cymraeg.

## **Q: How will lower ability learners manage the Unit 4 writing task?**

A: The writing task in Unit 4 is differentiated by outcome. The mark scheme for this question relating to Assessment Objective 2 allows candidates of all abilities to be awarded marks. For example, in band 1, 1-4 marks are available where "limited information is conveyed", whereas in band 5, 17-20 marks are available where "consistently relevant information is conveyed.

# General

## **Q: If the papers are no longer tiered, how can we be sure that lower ability pupils (former foundation) will be successful?**

A: The Units of the new specification are differentiated in different ways. For example, the level of demand of the questions in the unit 3 examination follow a peaks and troughs pattern to ensure that there are questions towards the end of the assessment which will be less challenging. In this way, learners will feel able to answer questions throughout the assessment and not just the initial questions as with previous assessments which were ramped in style. The productive skills (oracy and writing) are differentiated by outcome. Further information on this will be included in the "Preparing to Teach" events next term.
