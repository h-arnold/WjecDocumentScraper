{7}------------------------------------------------

**Total time for read aloud and role play: 2 minutes**

**Total marks: 11 marks**

**(AO2 – 8 marks) (AO3 – 3 marks)**

<span id="page-6-0"></span>

# Task 2: Presentation and Discussion

## Task 2a

Candidates will:

- give an oral presentation in which they communicate information, describe and narrate events. The presentation may be prepared two weeks in advance of the first timetabled assessment. The presentation can be on a subject of the candidate's choosing which falls within **one** of the following **three** broad themes:
  - Theme 1: language for leisure and wellbeing
  - Theme 2: language for travel
  - Theme 3: language for work and study.

Candidates will be marked on:

- communicating information, describing, and narrating events (AO1)
- using generally accurate pronunciation and intonation in order to communicate with a speaker of the language (AO3).

**Marks: (AO1 – 6 marks) (AO3 – 3 marks)**

Candidates may prepare their presentation two weeks prior to the first timetabled assessment.

Candidates are not permitted to use a dictionary in the preparation of their presentation. (Please refer to the controls set out in the appendix of this document).

Candidates may refer to prepared bullet points to support them with the delivery of their presentation [max. 30 words], complete and continuous sentences are not permitted. The bullet points must be given to the teacher immediately after the presentation (the bullet points will not be marked as part of the assessment).

## Task 2b

Candidates will:

- take part in an **unprepared** discussion relating to the presentation in the present, past and future tenses. Teachers will lead the discussion by asking questions relating to the presentation. The teacher may repeat or rephrase questions that the candidate does not understand.
- Teachers should provide opportunities for candidates to:
  - give clear responses to the questions they are asked (AO1)
  - use a variety of vocabulary, grammatical structures and different timeframes accurately (AO3).

Candidates may refer to prepared bullet points [max 30 words], to support them with the delivery of their presentation. The bullet points must be given to the teacher immediately after the presentation.

Examples of topics for the presentation are included in the Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching document.

{8}------------------------------------------------

**Marks: (AO1 – 10 marks) (AO3 – 5 marks)**

The presentation should last **no longer than 1 minute.** The discussion should last between **2-3 minutes. Total time for presentation and discussion: 3-4 minutes. Total marks for presentation and discussion: 24 marks (AO1 – 16 marks) (AO3 – 8 marks)**

![](_page_7_Picture_3.jpeg)

<span id="page-8-0"></span>

# Task 3: Conversation

Candidates will contribute to a conversation based on one of the 3 broad themes. The conversation should be based on a different broad theme to the one chosen for the presentation. Teachers must inform candidates of the allocated broad theme for the conversation at the start of the 10 minutes preparation time.

The conversation should be based on the broad theme that has not been covered in the presentation and the role play, so that all three broad themes are covered in the Unit 1 NEA. Candidates can make notes on one-side of A4 paper on the theme of the conversation during the preparation time (the notes will not be marked as part of the assessment).

The purpose of this element of the task is to encourage the candidate to demonstrate what language they know. In order to do this, teachers should provide opportunities for candidates to:

- give clear responses to the questions they are asked (AO1)
- develop their responses as far as they are able (AO1)
- express ideas and opinions
- use a variety of vocabulary, grammatical structures and different timeframes accurately (AO3).

Candidates may refer to notes made on the theme of the conversation during the preparation time which must be given to the teacher immediately after the assessment.

## Questioning technique:

- Teachers should avoid asking prepared questions and should instead build a conversation based on individual candidate responses.
- Questions should ideally be succinct so that there is less teacher talk and more candidate talk.
- Closed questions, which generally lead to yes/no answers, should be followed-up with an opportunity to express opinions or give more information (prompted, for example, by *,,Warum?"* or *,,Warum nicht").*
- Where possible, more open questions should be used in order to allow the candidate to offer more information/more developed responses.
- Useful question openers for extended answers could be ,,Beschreib... *"* or *,,Was denkst du über... ? "* for example.

**Total time for conversation: 2-4 minutes Total marks: 25 marks**

**(AO1 – 20 marks) (AO3 – 5 marks)**

Teachers should tailor the complexity of the questions to the ability of the candidate. Questions may be repeated or rephrased during this part of the task. The teacher should use their judgement as to when to move on if a candidate does not understand or respond to a question even after rephrasing. In order to sustain conversation and avoid long silences, it is better to move to a different question to encourage the candidate to keep talking. Candidates should be given the opportunity to respond in the present, past and future tenses. Candidates may refer to notes to support them with the theme of the conversation which must be given to the teacher immediately after the assessment.

When asking questions Teachers should use the different areas of the broad theme as well as the candidate's interests and experiences to continue the conversation. Candidates should be given the opportunity to respond in the present, past and future tenses.

Examples of questions that may be asked for each broad theme in the past, present and future tenses are included in the Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching document.

<span id="page-9-0"></span>

## Allocation of Role play cards:

The allocation of cards for the role play will be generated by the candidate's choice of broad theme for the presentation.

If the candidate's choice of presentation is from Theme 1, they must be allocated a role play from Theme 2. If the candidate's choice of presentation is from Theme 2, they must be allocated a role play from Theme 1. If the candidate's choice of presentation is from Theme 3, they may be allocated a role play from either Theme 1 or Theme 2.

There will be six role plays for Theme 1 and six role plays for Theme 2.

The first candidate must be given either card 1a or card 2a, depending on their choice of presentation. The second candidate must be given the prescribed card from the next row (depending on their choice of presentation), this sequence will continue for each teacher (not by the centre as a whole). After breaks in testing (including lunchtime and overnight) the sequence should continue. For example, if candidate 3 is tested before a break, the next candidate will be candidate 4. Teachers must follow this prescribed order.

| Candidate<br>Order | Theme 1<br>Presentation | Theme 2<br>Presentation | Theme 3<br>Presentation |
|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1                  | 2a                      | 1a                      | 1a                      |

| 10                 | 2e                      | 1e                      | 1d                      |
| 11                 | 2f                      | 1c                      | 2e                      |
| 12                 | 2c                      | 1b                      | 1a                      |

The allocation of role plays is designed to ensure that the assessment experienced by each candidate samples a range of vocabulary from the vocabulary list.

{11}------------------------------------------------

## Task setting

Tasks are set by WJEC. The assessment will be carried out by teachers at the centre, audio recorded and marked by external examiners. The role play cards will be sent to the Examinations Officer at the centre in a secure pack. Each centre will receive two packs. There will be instructions not to open the package until the specified date. Each candidate will be allocated one card. The list allocating the card to each candidate is shown above. The teacher must ensure that each candidate is assessed with the correct card. Teacher prompts for the role play, and guidance on setting questions for the discussion and conversation are provided below. The Teacher may open the packs up to three working days in advance of the first assessment date at the centre.

Centres must keep a record of the schedule (including dates) on which the assessments are conducted on the declaration form below. This form is for the centre and candidates to sign and declare that assessments have been conducted according to the requirements in the Assessment Pack and this must be submitted to WJEC with the audio recordings. Audio files should be uploaded to the WJEC Portal within 48 hours or two working days of the speaking assessments taking place.

## Task taking

Each candidate will have a preparation time of ten minutes prior to the commencement of the assessment. This preparation time must be supervised by an exam invigilator organised by the centre and who is not a subject specialist.

Candidates are not permitted to use dictionaries in any part of the assessment, including the preparation time.

Candidates are advised to spend their 10 minutes preparation time, practising the readaloud sub-vocally, making notes on what to say in the role play and conversation and of course, practising their presentation.

<span id="page-10-0"></span>The candidate may bring prepared bullet points [maximum 30 words] to support with the delivery of the presentation into the assessment. During the preparation time, the candidate may, if they wish, make notes on the read aloud and role play, and the allocated theme of the conversation on one-side of A4 paper and refer to these during the assessment. The teacher must check the notes prior to the commencement of the assessment and remove the bullet points from the candidate if they contain complete and continuous sentences. Otherwise, the notes must be handed to the teacher at the end of the test, along with the role play. After the preparation period of 10 minutes, the teacher must ensure that the candidate spends the following times on each task:

{12}------------------------------------------------

## Approximate timings for oral assessment

| Task                        | Approximate timings      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Role play                   | 2 minutes                |
| Presentation and discussion | 1 minute and 2-3 minutes |
| Conversation                | 2-4 minutes              |

The timing for the read aloud and role play is approximately 2 minutes but this will depend on each candidate. The timing for the presentation, discussion and conversation should be adhered to so that the candidate is able to access the full range of marks. The overall timings must be adhered to and any speaking evidence that exceeds these timings will not be marked.

<span id="page-11-0"></span>

## Conducting the assessment

Candidates will be allowed one attempt at the assessment. Once the recording begins it cannot be paused or stopped until the end of the assessment. The only circumstances in which a candidate can be re-tested are if there is a technical malfunction during the assessment (so that, for example, the assessment has not been recorded or is inaudible) or an incident occurs beyond the teacher's control which prevents the completion of the assessment. In any such circumstance, the teacher must inform WJEC immediately via the Examinations Officer at the centre. WJEC will then inform the centre which role play to use in place of the original allocation.

Detailed instructions regarding the process for submitting the materials will be communicated to centres through Examination Officers.

When introducing each candidate, the following convention must be used: Specification/centre number/candidate number/candidate name/role play card/ presentation theme/conversation theme/date.

<span id="page-11-1"></span>

## Managing the assessment

This is a WJEC marked (external) non-examination assessment. The following arrangements must be followed when managing the assessment

## Task setting

This assessment has been produced by WJEC and cannot be changed

## Time

Candidates must be allowed 10 minutes to complete this assessment. Candidates should spend approximately:

- 2 hours completing the preparation of the presentation
- 10 minutes preparation time immediately prior to the oral assessment
- 10 minutes for the assessment.

The time suggested for each task takes account of the contribution of the task to the overall assessment requirements. There can be no changes to the total time available for this assessment.

{13}------------------------------------------------

## Resources

Resources are not permitted for the preparation of the presentation. Candidates may take the pre-prepared bullet points for the presentation and the notes made on one-side of A4 paper during the preparation time into their assessment.

## Collaboration

Group work is **not** allowed. Candidates must complete all tasks individually.

## Supervision

Candidates must be supervised by an assessor whilst completing the activities. Centres must have in place systems to ensure candidates cannot access evidence they have been developing outside of supervised activities.

## Mark Scheme

## Generic marking principles

- Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
- Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
- Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

## General Advice

Examiners are asked to read and digest thoroughly all the information set out in the document *Instructions for Examiners* sent as part of the stationery pack. It is essential for the smooth running of the examination that these instructions are adhered to by all.

Particular attention should be paid to the following instructions regarding marking:

- Examiners must be positive in their approach. Look for opportunities to reward rather than penalise.
- Make sure that you are familiar with the read aloud sentence, the targeted soundspelling.
- Make sure you are familiar with the assessment grids and the descriptors for each section of the grids (pages 40, 54-57). See information below regarding advice on awarding marks using banded mark schemes.
- The specified length of the Speaking test is 7-10 minutes. You must stop marking after this maximum time has been reached.

Centres are instructed to ensure that each candidate carries out the correctly allocated role play card from the list. Examiners will be provided with a copy of this list and are required to check that the correct card has been used. In cases where an incorrect card has been used, the examiner is requested to inform WJEC.

## Banded mark schemes (Speaking)

Banded mark schemes are divided so that each band within a section has a relevant descriptor. The descriptors for the band provide a description of the performance level across the tested AOs for that band. Each band contains marks. To reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been provided, no marks should be awarded.

## Stage 1 – Deciding on the band

When deciding on a band, the candidate response should be viewed holistically. Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate's response and check whether it matches the descriptor for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the descriptor most closely matches the work.

{42}------------------------------------------------

## Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark

Having determined the appropriate band, deciding on a mark within a band will be made on the basis of a 'best fit' procedure, weaknesses in some areas being compensated for by strengths in others.

Examiners should use the full range of marks available to them. Marking should be positive, rewarding achievement rather that penalising failure or omissions. The awarding of marks must be directly related to the marking criteria, and all responses must be marked according to the banded levels provided for each question.

Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be provided and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work. Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the standardising material as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the work submitted.

This mark scheme instructs examiners to look for and reward valid alternatives where indicative content is suggested for an answer. This is not a checklist for expected content in an answer, or set out as a 'model answer', as responses must be marked in the banded levels of response provided for each question. Where a candidate provides a response that contains aspects or approaches not included in the indicative content, examiners should use their professional judgement as German specialists to determine the validity of the response in light of the task and reward as directed by the bands.

Candidates are free to choose any approach that is relevant to the set task. Candidates can (and will most likely) incorporate ideas other than those mentioned in the mark scheme.

The following pages contain:

- mark schemes for the role play
- assessment grids for the presentation, discussion and conversation.

When marking, equal credit is to be given for language used that is beyond the defined content in appendix B of the specification but that fulfils the task requirements.

When speaking about themselves, gender identification should not be an issue as candidates should be using first-person pronouns. If candidates choose to speak in the third person, they must be consistent in their pronoun choices, for example, use of 'they/them/xe/xhe' should not be seen as grammatically incorrect if the candidate is consistently using the chosen pronoun throughout their speaking. Please be mindful of candidates' choices in assessing all work. When discussing another individual in the third person where gender or gender preference is unknown or undisclosed, WJEC expects consistent application of the gender agreement of the candidate's choice.

## Glossary of terms

The following glossary of terms provides guidance on terms used within the banded mark schemes

| Major error    | An error that impedes communication and prevents the meaning from<br>being understood by the listener.<br>Examples of major errors in simple spoken language:<br>•<br>errors in conjugation of verbs:<br>er geht ins Kino? When intended meaning is to ask a question –<br>'Gehst du ins Kino?'<br>•<br>use of verb infinitive instead of past tense conjugation:<br>Ich gehen letzte Woche zum Strand.<br>•<br>pronunciation of ei/ie sounds making the word incorrect, as well as<br>other vowel sounds such as 'eu' and au':<br>weil –<br>pronounced as weel<br>Augen –<br>pronounced as Orgen<br>•<br>use of mother-tongue to replace German vocabulary<br>Ich gehe ins cinema.<br>Examples of major errors in complex spoken language:<br>•<br>incongruent verb tenses with expressions of time:<br>morgen habe ich Pommes gegessen<br>•<br>missing infinitive after conjugated verb:<br>ich werde Fußball<br>•<br>incorrect vocabulary usage resulting in contradictory or<br>nonsensical communication:<br>Ich will Lehrer bekommen. |

## Differentiation of descriptors in the mark scheme

The following words are used from top to lower bands in all banded mark schemes:

- consistent(ly) / always / almost always / all / almost all / highly
- main(ly) / most(ly) / often / frequent
- generally
- some / sometimes / occasionally
- basic / little
- limited / few
- minimal / rarely.

Please note that these should be viewed in conjunction with the descriptor as they may not always go from top to lower, for example: frequent errors would be in a lower mark band.

|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3    | Consistently accurate pronunciation, with few lapses in sound-spelling<br>correspondences which do not impede comprehension.        |
| 2    | Occasionally accurate pronunciation, with some<br>lapses in sound-spelling<br>correspondences which may impede comprehension.       |
| 1    | Pronunciation is rarely accurate, with frequent lapses in sound-spelling<br>correspondences which frequently impedes comprehension. |
| 0    | The response is not worthy of credit                                                                                                |

## AO2: (8 marks)

The candidate is required to ask a question and make statements in response to **four** written prompts.

For each candidate response, examiners should apply the following mark grid:

| Mark | Descriptor                                                                                                                |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2    | The response or question is fully communicated and unambiguous with a verb in the appropriate tense plus relevant detail. |
| 1    | The response or question is ambiguous or is only partially communicated with either appropriate verb or detail.           |
| 0    | The response is not worthy of credit.                                                                                     |

## Guidance for Examiners

Pages 42-53 suggest indicative content for the role plays tasks.

Do remember that this indicative content is a guide to the type of responses candidates **may** give; look for and reward all valid alternatives.

Candidates are instructed on the front of the question paper that they should try to respond with a short phrase or sentence including a relevant verb and that one-word answers will not be enough for full marks. Where one-word answers are given in response to a prompt, each such responses cannot score more than 1 mark.

## Information for candidates

The following information has been taken from the [JCQ Information for candidates](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) – non[examination assessments](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) and the [JCQ Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) Use in Assessments:](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/)  [Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/) This tells you about things that you **must** and **must not** do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not understand, you **must** ask your teacher.

### Preparing your work

- <span id="page-63-1"></span>• When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you need to ensure that your final product reflects your own independent work and isn't copied or paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
- If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you **must** tell your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
- If you worked as part of a group on a task, you **must** each write up your own account of the assignment. Even if the data you have is the same, you **must** describe in your own words how that data was obtained, and you **must** independently draw your own conclusions from the data.
- Take care of your work and keep it safe. **Do not** leave it lying around where your classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You **must** always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; **do not** share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
- **Do not** be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI tools and chatbots) – this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort of copying.
- <span id="page-63-2"></span>• You **must not** write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

### Plagiarism

Plagiarism involves taking someone else's words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them off as your own. **It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously.** Don't think you won't be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:

- Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
- Markers are highly experienced subject specialists they may have read the source you are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!
- Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and style of writing or punctuation.

## Penalties for breaking the regulations

<span id="page-63-3"></span>If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be applied:

- the piece of work will be awarded zero marks
- you will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question
- you will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series
- you will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

**Remember – it's your qualification so it needs to be your own work.**

## Appendix – Guide to Controls

Unit 1 is internally assessed through NEA. Controls are provided to:

- ensure that all candidates taking a specific qualification spend approximately the same amount of time on their assignments
- prevent third parties from providing inappropriate levels of guidance and input
- mitigate concerns about plagiarism and improve reliability and validity of results
- allow centres an appropriate degree of freedom and control
- allow candidates to produce an original piece of work.

There are a number of different aspects that are controlled within the internal assessment.

## These are:

- **supervision** how closely candidates should be monitored as they carry out the tasks
- **guidance** how much help you are allowed to provide candidates as they are completing the tasks
- **resources** whether candidates are allowed access to any resources as they're completing the tasks and if so, what resources
- **collaboration**  whether candidates are allowed to work with others as they're completing the tasks.

### Supervision

Unit 1 control (for the preparation of the presentation) the level of supervision is **Indirect**.

Unit 1 control (for the assessment of all speaking tasks) the level of supervision is **Direct.**

Please see the controls in the table below:

| Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
