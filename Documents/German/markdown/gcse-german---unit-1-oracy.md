speaker of the language (AO3).

Marks: (AO1 – 6 marks) (AO3 – 3 marks)

Candidates may prepare their presentation two weeks prior to the first timetabled
assessment.
Candidates are not permitted to use a dictionary in the preparation of their presentation.
(Please refer to the controls set out in the appendix of this document).
Candidates may refer to prepared bullet points to support them with the delivery of their

Task 3: Conversation

Candidates will contribute to a conversation based on one of the 3 broad themes.
The conversation should be based on a different broad theme to the one chosen for the
presentation. Teachers must inform candidates of the allocated broad theme for the
conversation at the start of the 10 minutes preparation time.
The conversation should be based on the broad theme that has not been covered in the
presentation and the role play, so that all three broad themes are covered in the Unit 1 NEA.
Candidates can make notes on one-side of A4 paper on the theme of the conversation
during the preparation time (the notes will not be marked as part of the assessment).

The purpose of this element of the task is to encourage the candidate to demonstrate what
language they know. In order to do this, teachers should provide opportunities for candidates
to:
•  give clear responses to the questions they are asked (AO1)
•  develop their responses as far as they are able (AO1)
•  express ideas and opinions
•  use a variety of vocabulary, grammatical structures and different timeframes accurately

(AO3).

Candidates may refer to notes made on the theme of the conversation during the preparation
time which must be given to the teacher immediately after the assessment.

Questioning technique:
•  Teachers should avoid asking prepared questions and should instead build a

conversation based on individual candidate responses.

•  Questions should ideally be succinct so that there is less teacher talk and more

candidate talk.

•  Closed questions, which generally lead to yes/no answers, should be followed-up with an
opportunity to express opinions or give more information (prompted, for example, by
,,Warum?” or ,,Warum nicht”).

•  Where possible, more open questions should be used in order to allow the candidate to

offer more information/more developed responses.

•  Useful question openers for extended answers could be  ,,Beschreib... ”  or ,,Was denkst

du über... ? ” for example.

Total time for conversation: 2-4 minutes
Total marks: 25 marks
(AO1 – 20 marks) (AO3 – 5 marks)

Teachers should tailor the complexity of the questions to the ability of the candidate.
Questions may be repeated or rephrased during this part of the task. The teacher should use
their judgement as to when to move on if a candidate does not understand or respond to a
question even after rephrasing. In order to sustain conversation and avoid long silences, it is
better to move to a different question to encourage the candidate to keep talking. Candidates
should be given the opportunity to respond in the present, past and future tenses.
Candidates may refer to notes to support them with the theme of the conversation which
must be given to the teacher immediately after the assessment.

When asking questions Teachers should use the different areas of the broad theme as well
as the candidate’s interests and experiences to continue the conversation. Candidates
should be given the opportunity to respond in the present, past and future tenses.

Examples of questions that may be asked for each broad theme in the past, present and
future tenses are included in the Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching document.

Allocation of Role play cards:

The allocation of cards for the role play will be generated by the candidate’s choice of broad
theme for the presentation.

If the candidate’s choice of presentation is from Theme 1, they must be allocated a role play
from Theme 2. If the candidate’s choice of presentation is from Theme 2, they must be
allocated a role play from Theme 1. If the candidate’s choice of presentation is from Theme
3, they may be allocated a role play from either Theme 1 or Theme 2.

There will be six role plays for Theme 1 and six role plays for Theme 2.

The first candidate must be given either card 1a or card 2a, depending on their choice of
presentation. The second candidate must be given the prescribed card from the next row
(depending on their choice of presentation), this sequence will continue for each teacher (not
by the centre as a whole). After breaks in testing (including lunchtime and overnight) the
sequence should continue. For example, if candidate 3 is tested before a break, the next
candidate will be candidate 4. Teachers must follow this prescribed order.

Task setting

Tasks are set by WJEC. The assessment will be carried out by teachers at the centre, audio
recorded and marked by external examiners. The role play cards will be sent to the
Examinations Officer at the centre in a secure pack. Each centre will receive two packs.
There will be instructions not to open the package until the specified date.  Each candidate
will be allocated one card. The list allocating the card to each candidate is shown above. The
teacher must ensure that each candidate is assessed with the correct card. Teacher prompts
for the role play, and guidance on setting questions for the discussion and conversation are
provided below. The Teacher may open the packs up to three working days in advance of
the first assessment date at the centre.

Centres must keep a record of the schedule (including dates) on which the assessments are
conducted on the declaration form below. This form is for the centre and candidates to sign
and declare that assessments have been conducted according to the requirements in the
Assessment Pack and this must be submitted to WJEC with the audio recordings. Audio files
should be uploaded to the WJEC Portal within 48 hours or two working days of the speaking
assessments taking place.

Task taking

Each candidate will have a preparation time of ten minutes prior to the commencement of
the assessment. This preparation time must be supervised by an exam invigilator organised
by the centre and who is not a subject specialist.

Candidates are not permitted to use dictionaries in any part of the assessment, including the
preparation time.

Candidates are advised to spend their 10 minutes preparation time, practising the read-
aloud sub-vocally, making notes on what to say in the role play and conversation and of
course, practising their presentation.

The candidate may bring prepared bullet points [maximum 30 words] to support with the
delivery of the presentation into the assessment. During the preparation time, the candidate
may, if they wish, make notes on the read aloud and role play, and the allocated theme of
the conversation on one-side of A4 paper and refer to these during the assessment. The
teacher must check the notes prior to the commencement of the assessment and remove
the bullet points from the candidate if they contain complete and continuous sentences.
Otherwise, the notes must be handed to the teacher at the end of the test, along with the
role play. After the preparation period of 10 minutes, the teacher must ensure that the
candidate spends the following times on each task:

The timing for the read aloud and role play is approximately 2 minutes but this will depend
on each candidate. The timing for the presentation, discussion and conversation should be
adhered to so that the candidate is able to access the full range of marks. The overall
timings must be adhered to and any speaking evidence that exceeds these timings will not
be marked.

Conducting the assessment

Candidates will be allowed one attempt at the assessment. Once the recording begins it
cannot be paused or stopped until the end of the assessment. The only circumstances in
which a candidate can be re-tested are if there is a technical malfunction during the
assessment (so that, for example, the assessment has not been recorded or is inaudible) or
an incident occurs beyond the teacher’s control which prevents the completion of the
assessment. In any such circumstance, the teacher must inform WJEC immediately via the
Examinations Officer at the centre. WJEC will then inform the centre which role play to use
in place of the original allocation.

Detailed instructions regarding the process for submitting the materials will be
communicated to centres through Examination Officers.

When introducing each candidate, the following convention must be used:
Specification/centre number/candidate number/candidate name/role play card/ presentation
theme/conversation theme/date.

Managing the assessment

This is a WJEC marked (external) non-examination assessment. The following
arrangements must be followed when managing the assessment

Task setting

This assessment has been produced by WJEC and cannot be changed

Time

Candidates must be allowed 10 minutes to complete this assessment. Candidates should
spend approximately:

•  2 hours completing the preparation of the presentation
•  10 minutes preparation time immediately prior to the oral assessment
•  10 minutes for the assessment.

The time suggested for each task takes account of the contribution of the task to the overall
assessment requirements. There can be no changes to the total time available for this
assessment.

Mark Scheme

Generic marking principles

•  Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).

•  Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for
the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the
quality of the candidate responses seen).

•  Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme.
Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

General Advice

Examiners are asked to read and digest thoroughly all the information set out in the
document Instructions for Examiners sent as part of the stationery pack. It is essential for the
smooth running of the examination that these instructions are adhered to by all.

Particular attention should be paid to the following instructions regarding marking:
•  Examiners must be positive in their approach. Look for opportunities to reward rather

than penalise.

•  Make sure that you are familiar with the read aloud sentence, the targeted sound-

spelling.

•  Make sure you are familiar with the assessment grids and the descriptors for each
section of the grids (pages 40, 54-57). See information below regarding advice on
awarding marks using banded mark schemes.

•  The specified length of the Speaking test is 7-10 minutes. You must stop marking after

this maximum time has been reached.

Centres are instructed to ensure that each candidate carries out the correctly allocated role
play card from the list. Examiners will be provided with a copy of this list and are required to
check that the correct card has been used. In cases where an incorrect card has been used,
the examiner is requested to inform WJEC.

Banded mark schemes (Speaking)

Banded mark schemes are divided so that each band within a section has a relevant
descriptor. The descriptors for the band provide a description of the performance level
across the tested AOs for that band. Each band contains marks. To reach the highest level
of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the requirements of the highest mark band.
Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it contains nothing of any significance to the
mark scheme, or where no response has been provided, no marks should be awarded.

Stage 1 – Deciding on the band

When deciding on a band, the candidate response should be viewed holistically.
Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate’s response and check
whether it matches the descriptor for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are
satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band
until the descriptor most closely matches the work.

GCSE German Unit 1: Oracy

CYFRINACHOL - CONFIDENTIAL

40

CYFRINACHOL - CONFIDENTIAL

Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark

Having determined the appropriate band, deciding on a mark within a band will be made on
the basis of a 'best fit' procedure, weaknesses in some areas being compensated for by
strengths in others.

Examiners should use the full range of marks available to them. Marking should be positive,
rewarding achievement rather that penalising failure or omissions. The awarding of marks
must be directly related to the marking criteria, and all responses must be marked according
to the banded levels provided for each question.

Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be provided and this
should be used as a reference material when assessing work. Examiners are reminded of
the need to revisit the standardising material as they apply the mark scheme in order to
confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the work submitted.

This mark scheme instructs examiners to look for and reward valid alternatives where
indicative content is suggested for an answer. This is not a checklist for expected content in
an answer, or set out as a 'model answer', as responses must be marked in the banded
levels of response provided for each question. Where a candidate provides a response that
contains aspects or approaches not included in the indicative content, examiners should use
their professional judgement as German specialists to determine the validity of the response
in light of the task and reward as directed by the bands.

Candidates are free to choose any approach that is relevant to the set task. Candidates can
(and will most likely) incorporate ideas other than those mentioned in the mark scheme.

The following pages contain:
•  mark schemes for the role play
•  assessment grids for the presentation, discussion and conversation.

When marking, equal credit is to be given for language used that is beyond the defined
content in appendix B of the specification but that fulfils the task requirements.

When speaking about themselves, gender identification should not be an issue as
candidates should be using first-person pronouns. If candidates choose to speak in the third
person, they must be consistent in their pronoun choices, for example, use of
‘they/them/xe/xhe’ should not be seen as grammatically incorrect if the candidate is
consistently using the chosen pronoun throughout their speaking. Please be mindful of
candidates’ choices in assessing all work. When discussing another individual in the third
person where gender or gender preference is unknown or undisclosed, WJEC expects
consistent application of the gender agreement of the candidate’s choice.

Glossary of terms

The following glossary of terms provides guidance on terms used within the banded mark
schemes

Major error

An error that impedes communication and prevents the meaning from
being understood by the listener.

Examples of major errors in simple spoken language:

•  errors in conjugation of verbs:

er geht ins Kino? When intended meaning is to ask a question –
‘Gehst du ins Kino?’

•  use of verb infinitive instead of past tense conjugation:

Ich gehen letzte Woche zum Strand.

•  pronunciation of ei/ie sounds making the word incorrect, as well as

other vowel sounds such as ‘eu’ and au’:
weil – pronounced as weel
Augen – pronounced as Orgen

•  use of mother-tongue to replace German vocabulary

Ich gehe ins cinema.

Examples of major errors in complex spoken language:

•

incongruent verb tenses with expressions of time:
morgen habe ich Pommes gegessen
•  missing infinitive after conjugated verb:

•

ich werde Fußball
incorrect vocabulary usage resulting in contradictory or
nonsensical communication:
Ich will Lehrer bekommen.

Minor error

An error that does not impede communication and allows the
meaning to be conveyed despite the error. Examples include minor
errors in pronunciation, incorrect gender, adjectival agreement and
word order of adjectives and application of grammar for contractions.

Examples:
•

incorrect gender and errors in agreement:
•
•  Mein Schwester ist siebzehn Jahre alt.

Ich habe ein braun Pferd.

Clear

The message is unambiguous.

Understandable  Able to be understood.

Development

Additional detail which elaborates. It can be a clause or separate
phrase.

Extended

A longer sequence which may include additional clause(s) giving
further details, reasoning and/or opinion.

Communication  Exchanging of information.

Relevant

Connected or appropriate to the stimulus.

Differentiation of descriptors in the mark scheme

The following words are used from top to lower bands in all banded mark schemes:
•  consistent(ly) / always / almost always / all / almost all / highly
•  main(ly) / most(ly) / often / frequent
•  generally
•  some / sometimes / occasionally
•  basic / little
limited / few
•
•  minimal / rarely.

Please note that these should be viewed in conjunction with the descriptor as they may not
always go from top to lower, for example: frequent errors would be in a lower mark band.

Guidance for Examiners

Pages 42-53 suggest indicative content for the role plays tasks.

Do remember that this indicative content is a guide to the type of responses candidates may
give; look for and reward all valid alternatives.

Candidates are instructed on the front of the question paper that they should try to respond
with a short phrase or sentence including a relevant verb and that one-word answers will not
be enough for full marks. Where one-word answers are given in response to a prompt, each
such responses cannot score more than 1 mark.

Information for candidates

The following information has been taken from the JCQ Information for candidates – non-
examination assessments and the JCQ Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use in Assessments:
Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications. This tells you about things that you must and must
not do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not
understand, you must ask your teacher.

Preparing your work

•  When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you need to

•

•

ensure that your final product reflects your own independent work and isn’t copied or
paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you must tell
your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
If you worked as part of a group on a task, you must each write up your own account of
the assignment. Even if the data you have is the same, you must describe in your own
words how that data was obtained, and you must independently draw your own
conclusions from the data.

•  Take care of your work and keep it safe. Do not leave it lying around where your

classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You
must always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; do not
share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your
password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
•  Do not be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI

tools and chatbots) – this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort
of copying.

•  You must not write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

Plagiarism

Plagiarism involves taking someone else’s words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them
off as your own. It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously. Don’t think you
won’t be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:
•  Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
•  Markers are highly experienced subject specialists – they may have read the source you

•

are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!
Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match
phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and
style of writing or punctuation.

Penalties for breaking the regulations

the piece of work will be awarded zero marks

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be
applied:
•
•  you will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question
•  you will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series
•  you will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of

time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

Remember – it’s your qualification so it needs to be your own work.
