WJEC GCSE German Unit 3 Sample External Assessment 13

{15}------------------------------------------------

#### **MARK SCHEME**

#### **Guidance for examiners**

#### **Generic marking principles**

- Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
- Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
- Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

#### **Positive marking**

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising candidates for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates' answers. The list is not exhaustive. The inclusion of *'Credit any other valid response.*' (or similar instruction) within mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates' responses. Credit should be given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates' answers.

|  | Mia: Michael, warum lernst du Französisch? |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

# Transcript

#### **Question 1**

#### **F1**

#### **Section 1**

Am Samstagmorgen spiele ich mit meiner Freundin Tennis.

Nach dem Spiel essen wir immer Hamburger mit Pommes im Café.

#### **F1**

#### **Section 2**

Am Samstagnachmittag gehe ich oft in die Stadt.

Ich gehe einkaufen. Ich liebe Kleider!

#### **F1**

#### **Section 3**

Abends bleibe ich normalerweise zu Hause. Ich sehe mit meiner Familie fern.

Manchmal gehe ich tanzen.

#### **Question 2**

#### **Section 1**

**F1: Lara:** Paul, was machst du, wenn du deine Hausaufgaben nicht

verstehst? Fragst du deine Eltern, ob sie dir helfen können?

**M1: Paul:** Nein! Das ist leider nicht möglich. Meine Eltern haben nie Zeit.

**Section 2**

**F1: Lara:**  Warum gehst du nicht ins Netz? Es gibt eine sehr gute Webseite

> für Schüler, die sehr einfach zu benutzen ist. Wenn man etwas schwierig findet, muss man nur das Fach auswählen und dann kann man mit jemandem sprechen, der online ist und dir helfen

kann.

**Section 3**

**M1: Paul:** Und was kostet das?

**F1: Lara:** Die Webseite ist kostenlos. Die Leute sind zum Beispiel

Studenten oder die, die nicht mehr arbeiten. Sie machen die

Arbeit immer freiwillig.

{26}------------------------------------------------

#### **Question 3**

#### **M1**

#### **Section 1**

Verbringen Sie ein tolles Wochenende in einer der schönsten Hauptstädte Europas!

In Wien gibt es so viele Sehenswürdigkeiten.

Wenn Sie sich für Geschichte interessieren, besuchen Sie die guten Museen!

#### **M1**

#### **Section 2**

Wien ist eine der grünsten Städte der Welt. Wenn das Wetter schön ist, gehen Sie in einem wunderbaren Park spazieren!

Am Abend könnten Sie ins Theater gehen!

#### **Question 4**

#### **F1**

#### **Section 1**

Am Dienstag war Weltschlaftag. An diesem Tag wollen Ärzte Menschen zeigen, wie wichtig es ist, genug zu schlafen. Wer zu wenig schläft, ist am nächsten Tag müde.

#### **F1**

#### **Section 2**

Man kann sich nicht richtig konzentrieren und nicht so gut lernen, wenn man zu wenig schläft. Und wer über längere Zeit regelmäßig zu wenig schläft, kann sogar ernst krank werden.

#### **F1 Section 3**

Wer nachts nicht leicht einschlafen kann, sollte sich während des Tages mehr bewegen – am besten draußen.

Leichter wird das Einschlafen, wenn man immer zur gleichen Zeit ins Bett geht. Es ist auch nicht gut, kurz vor dem Schlafengehen noch am Handy zu spielen oder Kaffee zu trinken.

{27}------------------------------------------------

#### **Question 5**

**Section 1**

**F1: Mia:** Michael, warum lernst du Französisch?

**M1: Michael** Ich spreche schon Spanisch, weil meine Mutter

Spanierin ist. Französisch ist also leicht für mich. Nach dem Abitur würde ich gerne durch Europa reisen und dann später Medizin studieren.

**Section 2**

**M1: Michael** Was würdest du gern als Beruf machen, Mia?

**F1: Mia** Ich würde gern Lehrerin werden. Ich möchte mit

Kindern arbeiten.

#### **Question 6**

#### **Section 1**

**M1: Peter:** Oh nein! Meine Lieblingsturnschuhe sind total kaputt. Ich trage sie oft, weil

laufen umweltfreundlicher ist als mit dem Auto zu fahren. Diese Schuhe

haben mir immer so gut gefallen, weil sie richtig bequem sind.

**Section 2**

**F1: Hanna:** Du musst also neue Turnschuhe kaufen?

**M1: Peter:** Nein, gar nicht. Ich werde sie reparieren lassen.

**F1: Hanna:** Wirklich?

**M1: Peter:** Ich kenne einen sehr guten Mann, der Schuhe repariert. Er ist so gut, dass

Leute ihm aus anderen Ländern Schuhe schicken. Er rettet bis zu 500

Paar Schuhe jeden Monat.

**Section 3**

**F1: Hanna:** Super! Das ist eine sehr gute Idee. Wir sollten nicht noch mehr Müll

produzieren, nur weil wir die ganze Zeit neue Schuhe kaufen wollen. Das

ist gar nicht umweltfreundlich!
