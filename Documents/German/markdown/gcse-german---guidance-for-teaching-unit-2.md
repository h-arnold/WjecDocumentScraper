recall and retrieval practice.

the rule is formally explained.

{12}------------------------------------------------

- The different verb tenses in the literary text might not however be the ones needed for the learner to be able to write their response.
- Providing learners with lots of opportunities to give opinions about characters and themes in the literary text is important. This can be done through speaking and writing tasks, incorporating creative activities such as making a social media page for one of the characters or through role play interviewing one of the characters. Learners will need support in extending their opinions, with not just whether they like or dislike the character, but justifying it. This may need extensive work on subordinate clauses using the conjunctions 'weil' and 'dass' - ich mag ihn/sie, weil er immer freundlich ist.
- The introduction of complex structures could be in the form of 'set phrases' such as 'wenn ich die Wahl hätte, würde ich...' , das ist das interessanteste Buch, das ich je gelesen habe.
- Providing learners with lots of opportunities to engage with the selected literary text and respond both orally and in written form will raise confidence and ensure progress is made. Learners may start by writing short responses to questions, using scaffolds and word banks, before developing and refining their work. Learners should also be given the opportunity to redraft written work based on feedback.

{13}------------------------------------------------

Learners will be required to:

- study a work in German
- demonstrate their understanding of the work by responding in German to a task set in Cymraeg/English.
- Teachers can choose a literary text which is appropriate to their context and will engage their learners.
- Learners will be familiar with reading a literary text in English or Welsh, but less familiar in an international language. Therefore, teachers will need to encourage learners to be resilient, not to focus on understanding and translating every word, to use gist and context to understand, use pictures to support understanding if using a graphic novel, use cognates, provide vocabulary lists to support learners in their understanding, etc.
- Chunking the literary text will be important to make it manageable for the learners. After reading each section, comprehension can be checked with tasks such as:
  - putting events in the correct order
  - multiple choice questions
  - true or false questions
  - gap fill tasks
  - comprehension questions.
- Learners will be required in the assessment to respond in German to questions set in English by the WJEC without any support. They will need to be able to provide examples and give opinions and provide reasons too.
- In preparation for the final NEA, individual notes can include the following sub-headings to provide opportunity to introduce and reinforce knowledge of basic core vocabulary (this list is provided as an example only and is not exhaustive):
  - Characters physical appearance, personality
  - Locations weather, places in town, countries
  - Events time, days, food, leisure, activities, routine.

|  | <ul><li>Learners could compare and contrast themes such as migration, environmental issues, history, daily routine, school, etc. by looking at their own area and context and that in the selected text. This could be done in the following ways:</li></ul> |  |

|  | <ul><li>Learners could interview one of the characters and ask questions based on the similarities and differences between the local and international context. Questions could be gathered and written collaboratively in groups using a platform such as Padlet.</li></ul> |  |
| Relationships and Sexuality Education | There are many opportunities to include Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in GCSE German. These opportunities are important to Learners because learners will build empathy and respect towards others by exploring other cultures. |  |
|                                                      | Below are some examples of how RSE can be embedded into teaching and learning:                                                                                                                                                                                              |  |

{18}------------------------------------------------

# *Example*

- Teachers could use their chosen text to explore themes relating to relationships, empathy, resilience, emotional well-being, etc.
- Learners could write a diary entry in the first person by imagining that they were one of the characters, describing events and how they felt.
- Learners could have a discussion to explore how different characters felt and why. This could be done through a role play.
- Teachers could encourage learners to explore why a certain character acts or behaves in a certain way. This will encourage them to build empathy with a character. This could require the introduction of more complex language such as Wenn ich \_\_\_\_ wäre.
- Teachers could take the opportunity to explore healthy relationships by creating a 'green flag/red flag' to list the qualities for healthy relationships as a group or in pairs.

Human Rights Education and Diversity

**There are many opportunities to include Human Rights Education and Diversity in GCSE German. These opportunities are important to Learners because they will value and respect the different cultures and communities within their context before broadening their horizons to explore the diverse cultures within Germany or a German speaking country. It is a fundamental right of a democracy to ensure that every citizen is treated with respect and dignity. Learners can express their own views and appreciate the views of others through the study of a variety of topics in German, which reflect a tolerant and diverse society.**

**Below are some examples of how Human Rights Education and Diversity can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### *Example*

Teachers could use their chosen literary text to explore themes relating to human rights, migration, antisemitism, identity, stereotypes, beliefs, racism, etc. In teaching it may be important for teachers to highlight that there is no one German culture, but explore the history of Juden in Deutschland or Gastarbeiter in Germany if it is relevant to understanding themes in the selected literary text.

{19}------------------------------------------------

- Learners could write a letter to a newspaper to discuss the theme of antisemitism, for example using the text as a stimulus.
- Learners could write a blog on one of the themes for a school website.
- If you are choosing a text which includes refugees, you may wish to look at the rights of refugees and asylum seekers

**There are many opportunities to include Career and Work-Related Experiences (CWRE) in GCSE German. These opportunities are important to Learners because it is essential for learners to understand the connection between learning at school and the world of work.**

**Below are some examples of how CWRE can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### *Example*

#### Careers and Work-Related Experiences

- Teachers could use their chosen literary text to explore themes relating to school, employment, future careers, Artificial Intelligence, etc.
- Learners could have an interview with one of the characters exploring their job, future aspirations, etc.
- Learners could draw up a list of comparisons between school in the UK and school in Germany or a German-speaking country based on the text if this is relevant.
- Learners could research the background of the author/director or actor from the selected work and prepare a presentation.
- Learners could write a CV for a character from the selected work and discuss in class what is needed in a CV.

| Reading | There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE German. These opportunities are important to Learners because they need opportunities to listen, read, speak and write. Below are some examples of how Literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning: Example <ul><li>Although this unit requires the learners to read a selected literary text and write a response to a set question, this unit will require learners to use all skills of literacy.</li><li>Teachers can use the selected literary text to develop reading skills.</li><li>Learners could answer comprehension questions on characters, themes or sections of the selected literary text (these could be factual and progress to more interpretive).</li><li>Learners could answer true or false statements and correct those which are false.</li><li>Learners could be provided with a text with missing words and asked to fill in key vocabulary or</li></ul> |  |  |
| Writing | grammar points. Example <ul><li>Writing skills – the learners will be able to write answers to a variety of tasks in the target language demonstrating their understanding of the selected literary text and giving their opinions.</li><li>Teachers will use the selected literary text to develop writing skills.</li><li>Learners could write an imagined dialogue between two characters in the selected text.</li><li>Learners could write character descriptions.</li><li>Learns could write a letter to one of the characters in the selected text.</li><li>Teachers could scaffold responses to questions by using word banks and sentence builders.</li></ul> |  |  |

{21}------------------------------------------------

• Teachers could do a plenary by asking learners to describe their favourite character using exactly 20 words, or say what they liked about the selected text and why in exactly 30 words. Teachers could make this more challenging with learners having to include a connective which isn't simple or use another tense.

#### **Cross-curricular Skills - Numeracy**

**There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE German. These opportunities are important to Learners because they need to use numbers and solve problems in real life situations.**

**Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

Understanding the number system helps us to represent and compare relationships between numbers and quantities

#### *Example*

- Teachers could use the selected literary text to develop numeracy skills.
- Learners could construct a timeline to describe and annotate when events took place.
- Learners could gather statistical data on frequency of words, tenses or grammatical points and present the findings as a pie chart or bar chart.

Learners could budget for 'race around the world' type adventure to the destination where the book is set.

# **Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competence** Citizenship **There are many opportunities to include Digital Competency in GCSE German. These opportunities are important to Learners because they need to be confident in using a range of digital technologies to help them function today and in our changing world. Below are some examples of how Digital Competency can be embedded into teaching and learning:** *Example* • Teachers can use the selected literary text to support digital competency. • If learners are set the task of creating their own version of the text with images (using an audio book app), it is important to explore the legal and ethical debates that surround using other people's creative work and that the learners consider the points of view of the original creator, potential audiences and the broader community when using materials belonging to others. • Teachers could also use the text to identify any stereotypes portrayed in the text and discuss why these can be harmful. If there are not any stereotypes, consider finding a newspaper article or cartoon that does portray stereotypes for example, about the role of women and compare how this differs to the text. You may also highlight that stereotypes differ across cultures. • If the text includes people using phones and social media, this could provide a springboard into discussing the positives and negatives of social media and how we can keep ourselves safe online. • As part of this topic, learners may read online about other peoples' interpretations of the text. You can use this as an opportunity to teach learners how to cite correctly. Or if they include any images in a resource that they create, teach them how to cite where the image has come from and whether it is a reliable source of information. Producing *Example* • Learners could use an app, such as Book Creator, to write their own version of the text with images, write it from the perspective of a different character or write a different ending. • Learners could create a short comic version of the literary text (if it is not a graphic novel) using a platform such as Storyboard That.

#### **Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competence**

- Learners could identify problems faced by the characters and propose different solutions.
- Teachers may wish to use Bloom's Taxonomy to develop critical thinking skills:

| Remember   | Describe a character? What can you remember about what they did/said and why?                                            |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Understand | Explain why an event took place or why a particular character acted in a certain way.                                    |
| Apply      | Make a map of the story.                                                                                                 |
| Analyse | Compare the cultural background/political situation/economic situation in the selected text to your local context. |
| Evaluate   | How would you feel if you were the central character? How would you act?                                                 |
| Create     | Create a new character for the story.                                                                                    |
