Teacher Guidance

Reading
and
Writing:

Learners should be able to:
•  understand and respond to written language
•  use their knowledge of grammar and vocabulary to support

their understanding of the work

•  use a variety of language patterns and different verb tenses

effectively

•  use complex structures where appropriate
•  select relevant vocabulary and grammar to express meaning
•  express themselves in written German to demonstrate their

understanding, ideas and opinions.

•  Learners will incrementally be developing the knowledge and

skills to be able to write extended answers of 70 and 130 words
which respond to the questions set, demonstrate their
understanding of the selected literary text and to ensure cultural
understanding of aspects of culture and language in German-
speaking countries.

•  To develop their written language, vocabulary gap fill summary
tasks could be set after each section of the selected literary
texts.

•  You can focus on key scenes from the text or film script and

translate them into English or compare published translations to
the original text.

•  Learners could create thematic and character vocabulary lists.
These could be stored on a virtual learning platform for all
learners to access when revising.

•  Quizlet sets could be set up to support regular learning of key
vocabulary. Kahoot and Quizziz could also be used as part of
recall and retrieval practice.

•  Grammar should be taught in small chunks and learners cshould
be encouraged to look for patterns and rules in context before
the rule is formally explained.

GCSE German Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 9

•  The different verb tenses in the literary text might not however be

the ones needed for the learner to be able to write their
response.

•  Providing learners with lots of opportunities to give opinions

about characters and themes in the literary text is important. This
can be done through speaking and writing tasks, incorporating
creative activities such as making a social media page for one of
the characters or through role play interviewing one of the
characters. Learners will need support in extending their
opinions, with not just whether they like or dislike the character,
but justifying it. This may need extensive work on subordinate
clauses using the conjunctions ‘weil’ and ‘dass’ - ich mag ihn/sie,
weil er immer freundlich ist.

•  The introduction of complex structures could be in the form of

‘set phrases’ such as ‘wenn ich die Wahl hätte, würde ich...’ , das
ist das interessanteste Buch, das ich je gelesen habe.

•  Providing learners with lots of opportunities to engage with the

selected literary text and respond both orally and in written form
will raise confidence and ensure progress is made. Learners may
start by writing short responses to questions, using scaffolds and
word banks, before developing and refining their work. Learners
should also be given the opportunity to redraft written work
based on feedback.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd 2025.

Learners will be required to:
•  study a work in German
•  demonstrate their understanding of the work by responding in

German to a task set in Cymraeg/English.

GCSE German Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 10

•  Teachers can choose a literary text which is appropriate to their

context and will engage their learners.

•  Learners will be familiar with reading a literary text in English or
Welsh, but less familiar in an international language. Therefore,
teachers will need to encourage learners to be resilient, not to
focus on understanding and translating every word, to use gist
and context to understand, use pictures to support understanding
if using a graphic novel, use cognates, provide vocabulary lists to
support learners in their understanding, etc.

•  Chunking the literary text will be important to make it

manageable for the learners. After reading each section,
comprehension can be checked with tasks such as:
•  putting events in the correct order
•  multiple choice questions
true or false questions
•
•  gap fill tasks
•  comprehension questions.

•  Learners will be required in the assessment to respond in

German to questions set in English by the WJEC without any
support. They will need to be able to provide examples and give
opinions and provide reasons too.

•

In preparation for the final NEA, individual notes can include the
following sub-headings to provide opportunity to introduce and
reinforce knowledge of basic core vocabulary (this list is provided
as an example only and is not exhaustive):
•  Characters – physical appearance, personality
•  Locations – weather, places in town, countries
•  Events – time, days, food, leisure, activities, routine.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd 2025.

GCSE German Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 11

•  Consider providing opportunities to discuss the following

questions:
•  Can you briefly explain what happens, to someone else?
•  Can you describe the key character(s)/events/location(s)?
•  Can you describe one theme in the book which interested

you and explain why?

•  What did you like? Why? What specific example can you give

from the text?

•  What didn’t you like? Why? What specific example can you

give from the text?

•  Would you recommend the book/film and why?
•  Can you summarise the plot?

Opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales

Curriculum for Wales Strands

Cross-cutting Themes

There are many opportunities to include Local, National & International Contexts in GCSE German.
These opportunities are important to Learners because they will start by making connections with
events and experiences with which they are familiar in their local area, before widening this to exploring
national and international contexts.

Below are some examples of how Local, National & International Contexts can be embedded into
teaching and learning:

Example

Local, National &
International Contexts

•

In Unit 2 teachers will have the opportunity to use literary texts to draw comparisons between their local
context and those in Germany or a German-speaking country.

•  Learners could compare and contrast themes such as migration, environmental issues, history, daily

routine, school, etc. by looking at their own area and context and that in the selected text.  This could be
done in the following ways:
•  Design an infographic to highlight the differences or similarities of the selected theme for the local

area and Germany or a German-speaking country. This could also be presented in a Venn Diagram
and then discussed.

•  Learners could interview one of the characters and ask questions based on the similarities and

differences between the local and international context. Questions could be gathered and written
collaboratively in groups using a platform such as Padlet.

Relationships and
Sexuality Education

There are many opportunities to include Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in GCSE German.
These opportunities are important to Learners because learners will build empathy and respect towards
others by exploring other cultures.

Below are some examples of how RSE can be embedded into teaching and learning:

© WJEC CBAC Ltd 2025.

GCSE German Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 15

Example

•  Teachers could use their chosen text to explore themes relating to relationships, empathy, resilience,

emotional well-being, etc.

•  Learners could write a diary entry in the first person by imagining that they were one of the characters,

describing events and how they felt.

•  Learners could have a discussion to explore how different characters felt and why. This could be done

through a role play.

•  Teachers could encourage learners to explore why a certain character acts or behaves in a certain way. This
will encourage them to build empathy with a character. This could require the introduction of more complex
language such as Wenn ich ____ wäre.

•  Teachers could take the opportunity to explore healthy relationships by creating a ‘green flag/red flag’ to list

the qualities for healthy relationships as a group or in pairs.

There are many opportunities to include Human Rights Education and Diversity in GCSE German. These
opportunities are important to Learners because they will value and respect the different cultures and
communities within their context before broadening their horizons to explore the diverse cultures within
Germany or a German speaking country. It is a fundamental right of a democracy to ensure that every
citizen is treated with respect and dignity. Learners can express their own views and appreciate the
views of others through the study of a variety of topics in German, which reflect a tolerant and diverse
society.

Human Rights Education
and Diversity

Below are some examples of how Human Rights Education and Diversity can be embedded into
teaching and learning:

Example

Teachers could use their chosen literary text to explore themes relating to human rights, migration,
antisemitism, identity, stereotypes, beliefs, racism, etc. In teaching it may be important for teachers to
highlight that there is no one German culture, but explore the history of Juden in Deutschland or
Gastarbeiter in Germany if it is relevant to understanding themes in the selected literary text.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd 2025.

GCSE German Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 16

•  Learners could write a letter to a newspaper to discuss the theme of antisemitism, for example using the text

as a stimulus.

If you are choosing a text which includes refugees, you may wish to look at the rights of refugees and asylum
seekers

•  https://www.unhcr.org/dach/de/was-wir-tun/asyl-in-deutschland/rechte-nach-der-anerkennung.

There are many opportunities to include Career and Work-Related Experiences (CWRE) in GCSE
German. These opportunities are important to Learners because it is essential for learners to
understand the connection between learning at school and the world of work.

Below are some examples of how CWRE can be embedded into teaching and learning:

Example

•  Teachers could use their chosen literary text to explore themes relating to school, employment, future

careers, Artificial Intelligence, etc.

Careers and Work-Related
Experiences

GCSE German Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 17

Cross-curricular Skills - Literacy

There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE German. These opportunities are important to
Learners because they need opportunities to listen, read, speak and write.

Below are some examples of how Literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning:

Example

•  Although this unit requires the learners to read a selected literary text and write a response to a set

question, this unit will require learners to use all skills of literacy.

Reading

•  Teachers can use the selected literary text to develop reading skills.

•  Learners could answer comprehension questions on characters, themes or sections of the selected

literary text (these could be factual and progress to more interpretive).

•  Learners could answer true or false statements and correct those which are false.

•  Learners could be provided with a text with missing words and asked to fill in key vocabulary or

grammar points.

Example

•  Writing skills – the learners will be able to write answers to a variety of tasks in the target language

demonstrating their understanding of the selected literary text and giving their opinions.

•  Teachers will use the selected literary text to develop writing skills.
•  Learners could write an imagined dialogue between two characters in the selected text.
•  Learners could write character descriptions.
•  Learns could write a letter to one of the characters in the selected text.

GCSE German Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 18

•  Teachers could do a plenary by asking learners to describe their favourite character using exactly 20
words, or say what they liked about the selected text and why in exactly 30 words. Teachers could
make this more challenging with learners having to include a connective which isn’t simple or use
another tense.

Cross-curricular Skills - Numeracy

Understanding the number
system helps us to
represent and compare
relationships between
numbers and quantities

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE German. These opportunities are important
to Learners because they need to use numbers and solve problems in real life situations.

Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning:

Example

•  Teachers could use the selected literary text to develop numeracy skills.

•  Learners could construct a timeline to describe and annotate when events took place.

•  Learners could gather statistical data on frequency of words, tenses or grammatical points and present the

findings as a pie chart or bar chart.

Learners could budget for ‘race around the world’ type adventure to the destination where the book is set.

GCSE German Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 19

Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competence

There are many opportunities to include Digital Competency in GCSE German. These opportunities are
important to Learners because they need to be confident in using a range of digital technologies to help
them function today and in our changing world.

Below are some examples of how Digital Competency can be embedded into teaching and learning:

Example

•  Teachers can use the selected literary text to support digital competency.

Citizenship

•

If learners are set the task of creating their own version of the text with images (using an audio book
app), it is important to explore the legal and ethical debates that surround using other people’s creative
work and that the learners consider the points of view of the original creator, potential audiences and the
broader community when using materials belonging to others.

•  Teachers could also use the text to identify any stereotypes portrayed in the text and discuss why these
can be harmful. If there are not any stereotypes, consider finding a newspaper article or cartoon that
does portray stereotypes for example, about the role of women and compare how this differs to the text.
You may also highlight that stereotypes differ across cultures.

•

If the text includes people using phones and social media, this could provide a springboard into discussing
the positives and negatives of social media and how we can keep ourselves safe online.

•  As part of this topic, learners may read online about other peoples’ interpretations of the text. You can use

this as an opportunity to teach learners how to cite correctly. Or if they include any images in a resource that
they create, teach them how to cite where the image has come from and whether it is a reliable source of
information.

Example

Producing

write it from the perspective of a different character or write a different ending.

•  Learners could use an app, such as Book Creator, to write their own version of the text with images,

•  Learners could create a short comic version of the literary text (if it is not a graphic novel) using a

platform such as Storyboard That.
