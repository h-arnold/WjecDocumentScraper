{9}------------------------------------------------

#### Assessment details

#### **Unit 1 – Oracy**

The assessment lasts for 7–10 minutes

Preparation time: 10 minutes

30% of qualification

60 marks

This unit requires learners to speak using clear and comprehensible German to:

- read aloud a short sentence and participate in a role play
- give a presentation, prepared in advance, based on their own interest and take part in a short unprepared discussion relating to the presentation
- take part in a short unprepared conversation.

The rubrics and stimuli will all be in Cymraeg/English (except for the read aloud task). The language of response will be in the assessed language.

**Candidates are not permitted to use a dictionary in any part of the assessment. The assessment must be submitted digitally.**

## Task 1: Read aloud and role play (11 marks)

Candidates can make notes on one-side of A4 paper for the read aloud and role play during the preparation time (the notes will not be marked as part of the assessment).

### Task 1a: The read aloud

The candidate will begin by reading aloud the short sentence in German to demonstrate their understanding of sound-spelling correspondence.

### Task 1b: The role play

The role play contains **four** interactions. The teacher will start the role play, they are not required to read out the scenario to the candidate and **must not** rephrase the prompts. Candidates may refer to notes to support them with the read aloud and the role play which must be given to the teacher immediately after the assessment.

During the role play, learners will:

- respond appropriately to questions or statements as prompted by the bullet points on the role play card
- formulate a question.

Learners should be able to demonstrate their understanding of the assessed language through their responses in a range of different settings to include the following:

- train/bus station
- tourist information office
- cinema/theatre/venue
- campsite/hostel/hotel
- pharmacy/doctor's surgery/hospital
- leisure centre
- shops
- café/restaurant
- in the home
- in town.

{10}------------------------------------------------

Candidates should be able to engage in transactions including asking and answering questions, asking for advice, making a complaint, reporting a problem, explaining, describing, giving reasons and expressing opinions. The scenario will provide candidates with guidance and prompts in Cymraeg/English on the responses that are required.

**Total time for read aloud and role play: 2 minutes Total marks: 11**

**(AO2 – 8 marks) (AO3 – 3 marks)**

### Task 2: Presentation and Discussion

#### Task 2a

Candidates will:

- give an oral presentation in which they communicate information, describe and narrate events. The presentation may be prepared two weeks in advance of the first timetabled assessment. The presentation can be on a subject of the candidate's choosing which falls within one of the following three broad themes:
  - Theme 1: language for leisure and wellbeing
  - Theme 2: language for travel
  - Theme 3: language for work and study.

Candidates will be marked on:

- communicating information, describing, and narrating events (AO1)
- using generally accurate pronunciation and intonation in order to communicate with a speaker of the language (AO3).

**Marks: (AO1 – 6 marks) (AO3 – 3 marks)**

Candidates may prepare their presentation two weeks prior to the first timetabled assessment.

Candidates are not permitted to use a dictionary in the preparation of their presentation. Candidates may refer to prepared bullet points to support them with the delivery of their presentation [max. 30 words], complete and continuous sentences are not permitted. The bullet points must be given to the teacher immediately after the presentation (the bullet points will not be marked as part of the assessment).

#### Task 2b

Candidates will:

- take part in an **unprepared** discussion relating to the presentation in the present, past
- and future tenses. Teachers will lead the discussion by asking questions relating to the
- presentation. The teacher may repeat or rephrase questions that the candidate does not understand.
- Teachers should provide opportunities for candidates to:
  - give clear responses to the questions they are asked (AO1)
  - use a variety of vocabulary, grammatical structures and different timeframes accurately (AO3).

Candidates may refer to prepared bullet points [max 30 words], to support them with the delivery of their presentation. The bullet points must be given to the teacher immediately after the presentation.

{11}------------------------------------------------

**Marks: (AO1 – 10 marks) (AO3 – 5 marks)**

The presentation should last **no longer than 1 minute.**

The discussion should last between **2-3 minutes.**

**Total time for presentation and discussion: 3-4 minutes. Total marks for presentation and discussion: 24 marks**

**(AO1 – 16 marks) (AO3 – 8 marks)**

### Task 3: Conversation

Candidates will contribute to a conversation based on one of the 3 broad themes. The conversation should be based on a different broad theme to the one chosen for the presentation. Teachers must inform candidates of the allocated broad theme for the conversation at the start of the 10 minutes preparation time.

The conversation should be based on the broad theme that has not been covered in the presentation and the role play, so that all three broad themes are covered in the Unit 1 NEA.

Candidates can make notes on one-side of A4 paper on the theme of the conversation during the preparation time (the notes will not be marked as part of the assessment).

The purpose of this element of the task is to encourage the candidate to demonstrate what language they know. In order to do this, teachers should provide opportunities for candidates to:

- give clear responses to the questions they are asked (AO1)
- develop their responses as far as they are able (AO1)
- express ideas and opinions
- use a variety of vocabulary, grammatical structures and different timeframes accurately (AO3).

Candidates may refer to notes made on the theme of the conversation during the preparation time which must be given to the teacher immediately after the assessment.

#### Questioning technique:

- Teachers should avoid asking prepared questions and should instead build a conversation based on individual candidate responses.
- Questions should ideally be succinct so that there is less teacher talk and more candidate talk.
- Closed questions, which generally lead to yes/no answers, should be followed-up with an opportunity to express opinions or give more information (prompted, for example, by ,,*Warum*?" or ,,*Warum nicht*").Where possible, more open questions should be used in order to allow the candidate to offer more information/more developed responses.
- Useful question openers for extended answers could be ,*,Beschreib*... " or ,,*Was denkst du über...* ? " for example.

**Total time for conversation: 2-4 minutes**

**Total marks: 25 marks**

**(AO1 – 20 marks) (AO3 – 5 marks)**

Teachers should tailor the complexity of the questions to the ability of the candidate. Questions may be repeated or rephrased during this part of the task. The teacher should use their judgement as to when to move on if a candidate does not understand or respond to a question even after rephrasing. In order to sustain conversation and avoid long silences, it is better to move to a different question to encourage the candidate to keep talking. Candidates should be given the opportunity to respond in the present, past and future tenses.

{12}------------------------------------------------

Candidates may refer to notes to support them with the theme of the conversation which must be given to the teacher immediately after the assessment.

When asking questions Teachers should use the different areas of the broad theme as well as the candidate's interests and experiences to continue the conversation. Candidates should be given the opportunity to respond in the present, past and future tenses.

### Allocation of Role play cards:

The allocation of cards for the role play will be generated by the candidate's choice of broad theme for the presentation.

If the candidate's choice of presentations is from Theme 1, they must be allocated a role play from Theme 2. If the candidate's choice of presentations is from Theme 2, they must be allocated a role play from Theme 1. If the candidate's choice of presentations is from Theme 3, they may be allocated a role play from either Theme 1 or Theme 2.

There will be six role plays for Theme 1 and six role plays for Theme 2.

The first candidate must be given either card 1a or card 2a, depending on their choice of presentation. The second candidate must be given the prescribed card from the next row (depending on their choice of presentation), this sequence will continue for each teacher (not by the centre as a whole). After breaks in testing (including lunchtime and overnight) the sequence should continue. For example, if candidate 3 is tested before a break, the next candidate will be candidate 4. Teachers must follow this prescribed order.

| Candidate<br>Order | Theme 1<br>Presentation | Theme 2<br>Presentation | Theme 3<br>Presentation |
|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1                  | 2a                      | 1a                      | 1a                      |

| 6                  | 2f                      | 1f                      | 2f                      |
| 7                  | 2d                      | 1d                      | 2f                      |
| 8                  | 2a                      | 1f                      | 1b                      |
| 9                  | 2b                      | 1a                      | 2c                      |
| 10                 | 2e                      | 1e                      | 1d                      |
| 11                 | 2f                      | 1c                      | 2e                      |
| 12                 | 2c                      | 1b                      | 1a                      |

{13}------------------------------------------------

The allocation of role plays is designed to ensure that the assessment experienced by each candidate samples a range of vocabulary from the vocabulary list.

Please note the allocation order will change each year.

### Task setting

Tasks are set by WJEC. The assessment will be carried out by teachers at the centre, audio recorded and marked by external examiners. The role play cards will be sent to the Examinations Officer at the centre in a secure pack. Each centre will receive two packs. There will be instructions not to open the package until the specified date. Each candidate will be allocated one card. The list allocating the card to each candidate is shown above. The teacher must ensure that each candidate is assessed with the correct card. Teacher prompts for the role play, and guidance on setting questions for the discussion and conversation are provided below. The Teacher may open the packs up to three working days in advance of the first assessment date at the centre.

Centres must keep a record of the schedule (including dates) on which the assessments are conducted on the declaration form. This form is for the centre and candidates to sign and declare that assessments have been conducted according to the requirements in the Assessment Pack and this must be submitted to WJEC with the audio recordings. Audio files should be uploaded to the WJEC Portal within 48 hours or two working days of the speaking assessments taking place.

### Task taking

Each candidate will have a preparation time of ten minutes prior to the commencement of the assessment. This preparation time must be supervised by an exam invigilator organised by the centre and who is not a subject specialist.

Candidates are not permitted to use dictionaries in any part of the assessment, including the preparation time.

Candidates are advised to spend their 10 minutes preparation time, practising the readaloud sub-vocally, making notes on what to say in the role play and conversation and of course, practising their presentation.

The candidate may bring prepared bullet points [maximum 30 words] to support with the delivery of the presentation into the assessment. During the preparation time, the candidate may, if they wish, make notes on the read aloud and role play, and the allocated theme of the conversation on one-side of A4 paper and refer to these during the assessment. The teacher must check the notes prior to the commencement of the assessment and remove the bullet points from the candidate if they contain complete and continuous sentences. Otherwise, the notes must be handed to the teacher at the end of the test, along with the role play. After the preparation period of 10 minutes, the teacher must ensure that the candidate spends the following times on each task:

{14}------------------------------------------------

### Approximate timings for oral assessment

| Task                        | Approximate timings      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Role play                   | 2 minutes                |
| Presentation and discussion | 1 minute and 2-3 minutes |
| Conversation                | 2-4 minutes              |

The timing for the read aloud and role play is approximately 2 minutes but this will depend on each candidate. The timing for the presentation, discussion and conversation should be adhered to so that the candidate is able to access the full range of marks. The overall timings must be adhered to and any speaking evidence that exceeds these timings will not be marked.

### Conducting the assessment

Candidates will be allowed one attempt at the assessment. Once the recording begins it cannot be paused or stopped until the end of the assessment. The only circumstances in which a candidate can be re-tested are if there is a technical malfunction during the assessment (so that, for example, the assessment has not been recorded or is inaudible) or an incident occurs beyond the teacher's control which prevents the completion of the assessment. In any such circumstance, the teacher must inform WJEC immediately via the Examinations Officer at the centre. WJEC will then inform the centre which role play to use in place of the original allocation.

Detailed instructions regarding the process for submitting the materials will be communicated to centres through Examination Officers.

When introducing each candidate, the following convention must be used: Specification/centre number/candidate number/candidate name/role play card/ presentation theme/conversation theme/date.

| Learners should be able to:<br>• develop their listening skills to understand and respond<br>to different types of spoken language in a range of<br>different contexts<br>• use their knowledge of grammar and vocabulary to<br>support their understanding including the relationship<br>between the past, present and future tenses<br>• communicate and interact clearly and effectively for<br>different purposes<br>• communicate information, ideas and opinions in a variety<br>of contexts<br>• use their knowledge of vocabulary and grammar to<br>communicate meaningfully<br>• reference past, present and future events where<br>appropriate<br>• use more complex structures where appropriate<br>• use generally accurate pronunciation and intonation. | • Activities in this area will complement work carried out in Unit 3.<br>You should provide learners with opportunities to listen and<br>respond to questions across the three themes on a regular basis.<br>You may wish to establish hot-seating sessions on particular<br>aspects of each theme where learners both devise and answer<br>questions asked by other class members, such as the topic of my<br>favourite holiday destination. 'Speed dating' could also be used as<br>a fun way of engaging learners in listening and speaking on a<br>particular theme.<br>• Other listening/speaking games such as 'What am I?', where one<br>learner reads a definition and another learner has both the answer<br>and the subsequent definition, would be useful to encourage oral<br>responses to spoken language. Such activities could be tailored to<br>different contexts and themes and would allow learners to respond<br>to what they hear as well as allowing them opportunities to read<br>aloud. Taboo is also a useful game where learners need to<br>describe something without using the word.<br>• If learners have access to digital technology at home, you could<br>use apps such as 'Vocaroo'. Learners would listen to your question<br>and record their response. Pad let could also be used for this type<br>of activity. Teachers can insert a voice file with a question and<br>learners could record an answer.<br>• The wheel of names could be easily adapted to have a range of<br>questions related to a topic at the start of a lesson. The wheel is<br>spun. One learner could read the question aloud and someone else<br>in the class could answer. |  |

- You may wish to teach patterns for the past, present and future tenses individually at first. This may well be part of a spiral curriculum which has been introduced in earlier years. Once learners are confident with the formation of each one, you could explicitly compare written tense patterns and sound patterns so they are aware of similarities and differences and become adept at distinguishing between these. You could play different games using mini white boards with delayed dictation/translation or just reading aloud a tense pattern e.g. ich bin in die Stadt gegangen and asking learners to identify whether the pattern is past/present /future. Asking them why is also important to check for understanding. Such work will support Units 3 and 4.
- Attention should also be given to time markers. Learners could, for example, categorise a range of time markers into past/present/future (letzte Woche/heute/nächste Woche) from what they hear or read. It may be helpful over time to create banks of questions and responses in different tenses to ask for advice/information , etc.
- It is important that learners are aware that grammatical structures and vocabulary are transferable from one theme to another. To practise this, you could provide learners with specific grammatical structures/vocabulary and challenge them to create as many sentences as possible with these on any theme.
- Structures could include key phrases such as es gibt, ich denke, dass or meiner Meinung nach to encourage learners to think across themes. The task could be differentiated to be in the past, present or future tense or a combination of these. You could use a photo or image as a stimulus , such as a picture of a school and ask learners to give three sentences in the past, present or future using key phrases. Transferring the key phrases to another theme will be important to signpost to the learners that phrases are not limited to one theme.

{18}------------------------------------------------

|  | Supporting learners to communicate ideas and opinions could be achieved through activities such as mini debates, where learners provide opinions and justifications on different discussion points from across themes, for example Sport ist nicht wichtig! You may also wish to ask learners to report back on a topic they have researched where they provide both information and opinions. Providing a list of sentence starters with opinion phrases such as ich denke, dass; meiner Meinung nach; ich glaube, dass would be helpful for learners to refer to during such oral activities and to keep as a future reference. See Appendix B of the specification for further vocabulary.It would be helpful to highlight complex structures, including idioms, when they arise in work completed for other units – this could be from Unit 2. A class bank of structures could be collated and shared with learners so that they can use them when planning and performing mini presentations in a range of contexts, such as a talking about their school, or what they do in their free time. You may wish to make learners aware of the importance of including more complex structures by highlighting where they are accredited in mark schemes or planning them into self/peer assessments so that learners understand that they gain 'bonus points' for incorporating such language. |

• To enable learners to develop accurate pronunciation and intonation, sound-spelling correspondence rules should be taught explicitly and then practised on a regular basis. Learners should have opportunities to read aloud from a range of material so that they consolidate patterns and develop confidence. They could, for example, practise the pronunciation of 12-14 word sentences as they read their Unit 2 text. It would be helpful to provide learners with a reference list of common sound-spelling correspondence rules to which they could refer as they read aloud, for example when working in pairs, so that they can reflect upon and improve each other's pronunciation. A list of these can be found in Appendix A of the specification. Other activities which would support learners to consider sound-spelling correspondence include listening to songs and completing gap-fill activities, or the teacher mispronouncing words that learners are reading and asking learners to spot the mistake (faulty echo type activities). Delayed dictation and delayed translation are also good activities to support sound-spelling correspondence.

{20}------------------------------------------------

Learners should be able to demonstrate their understanding of German through their responses in a range of different settings to include the following:

- train / bus station
- tourist information office
- cinema / theatre / venue
- campsite / hostel / hotel
- pharmacy / doctor's surgery / hospital
- leisure centre
- shops
- café / restaurant
- in the home
- in town.

• In order to develop learners' vocabulary to speak in different settings, you may wish to set vocabulary learning tasks using online language learning sites such as [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/) or [Quizlet.](https://quizlet.com/gb) Online activities such as [Kahoot](https://kahoot.it/) and [Blooket](https://www.blooket.com/) can also be used as wholeclass vocabulary learning activities for specific themes (see Appendix B of the specification for vocabulary lists).

- Learners can listen to podcasts, for example on Spotify or YouTube, in order to develop vocabulary and structures related to specific contexts. You may also wish to ask learners to write role plays on each of these topics. They could also write and perform raps/songs with questions and information from different settings.
- It is important that learners can use the du and Sie forms of address and they should have opportunities in role play practice to use both of these to form questions and provide information.

Learners should be able to engage in transactions including:

- asking and responding to questions
- asking for advice
- making a complaint
- reporting a problem
- explaining, describing and giving reasons
- expressing opinions.

- It would be helpful to explicitly discuss different question words with learners. This could be done, for example, by asking learners to formulate questions based on an image/photo or in preparation for an interview with a German speaker. See Appendix B of the specification for question structures.
- Making learners aware of negative phrases for transactions is also advisable, for example*, es gibt kein/keinen/keine..ich habe keinen/keine/kein...*Opinion phrases such as ich finde, dass/ich denke, dass/ich glaube, dass/Meiner Meinung nach and *c*onjunctions for presenting reasons such as *denn and weil* should also be practised explicitly*.* It would be helpful to regularly provide learners with different role play scenarios from across the three themes so they can practise using this language.

{21}------------------------------------------------

Learners will be required to:

- participate in a role play
- give a presentation, prepared in advance, based on their own interest and take part in a short unprepared discussion relating to the presentation
- take part in a short unprepared conversation.

- Learners may wish to write and perform their own role plays around contexts from the three themes. They could, for example write a scene for a soap opera containing specific information. Learners could be asked as a starter activity to prepare the answer to one written bullet point and then to read this to a partner/the class for feedback.
- Question phrases could also be practised in this way and taken from any of the three themes so that learners are aware that these structures are transferable across themes.
- Learners should have regular opportunities to present to others in a range of contexts. You may wish to begin with learners presenting a few sentences on a subject that they have researched. Initially, this could be carried out in pairs/groups and with visual support such as a PowerPoint, Canva, or use of a picture or infographic. Presentations could also be encouraged in the style of a podcast or TikTok video or vlog on aspects such as a different cultural festival in German/Austria or Switzerland, or a learner's favourite music group.
- In preparation for the Unit 1 examination, learners should also have regular practice devising bullet points to support their presentations. You may wish to take an example presentation and discuss explicitly with the class what the key points are that would formulate the bullet points and how these would best help them to remember the structure of their work. Learners could then carry out this activity for other exemplar presentations before devising bullet points for their own work.
- It would also be helpful if learners became accustomed to anticipating the sorts of questions that might be asked about their presentations. Again, this could initially be done as a whole-class activity with consideration given to the 5Ws that they may be familiar with from their study of English.

{22}------------------------------------------------

- You could also encourage learners to formulate a follow -up question each to ask to their peers who are presenting to the class on different topics. As well as helping them to predict questions, this will also help develop learners' listening skills.
- A key consideration for the unprepared conversation is to remind learners that the grammatical structures and vocabulary they learn across the three themes can be transferred and recycled in different contexts.
- Learners should be given regular opportunities to convey information, describe and narrate events across the three themes and to develop their responses by providing opinions and reasons. Learners could participate in an interview -style activity where they are a celebrity and their partner asks them unseen questions from one or more of the themes , or they could engage in a mock interview for a Saturday job with a partner. Discussion with learners around the preparation of questions for such activities would be crucial and it would be important to highlight that questions should be designed to allow learners to respond in different tenses and to develop their answers as fully as possible.
- To add to the authenticity of such activities you may wish audio record the interviews as podcasts or TikTok videos. This would allow learners the opportunity to reflect, identifying their own strengths and areas for development following the oral work.
- It may be helpful to devise a bank of questions for learners across the 3 themes which include opportunities for expression in the past, present and future tenses. Tense work could also be practised, for example, by asking learners to change a conversation about the future into the past by changing tenses and time markers. This would also complement learners' work in Unit 4.

| learn about the culture and<br>society in the countries and<br>communities where the<br>international language is<br>spoken | •<br>For Theme 1 you may wish to ask learners to research a<br>singer from a German-speaking country/community. They<br>could listen to their music and plan and present a brief<br>presentation about them including their background, their<br>music and their popularity. This would allow learners to use<br>a range of vocabulary and structures that can also be<br>applied to other themes and units. It would provide them<br>with practice of arranging their ideas in a logical order and<br>developing bullet points that will best support them when<br>speaking. As an extension to this, other learners could<br>prepare questions to ask. This would allow for the teaching<br>of question structures and allow the presenter to practise<br>responding spontaneously on a familiar topic. Initially they<br>could use a PowerPoint or 'canva'<br>or infographic to support<br>their presentation. This could be done in pairs to allow<br>learners to gain confidence. |

They could devise and read<br>aloud a list of questions that you would ask the travel agent<br>about their holiday. You could then develop this activity into<br>a role play where one partner asks the questions and the<br>other partner answers based on the information about the<br>country that they have discovered in their research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

- You may wish to ask learners to watch an extract of the film 'Almanya' and use resources on the [Goethe Institute's](https://www.goethe.de/prj/dlp/de/unterrichtsmaterial/reihe/deutsche-filme/almanya_willkommen_in_deutschland_filmdidaktisierung)  [website](https://www.goethe.de/prj/dlp/de/unterrichtsmaterial/reihe/deutsche-filme/almanya_willkommen_in_deutschland_filmdidaktisierung) to support discussions on characters and themes. They could role play one of the characters and record an interview with them.
- Learners could listen to extracts of German music recorded by German artists of diverse backgrounds. You could ask them to give their favourite and explain why. Learners could then choose their favourite artist and produce a short presentation on the artist.

### have direct or indirect contact with speakers of the language

- Centres and learners will be able to use initiatives such as MFL Mentoring – Modern Foreign Languages and Llwybrau at Ieithoedd Cymru Routes into Languages Cymru.
- Both schemes support international languages and multilingualism in the new curriculum for Wales. Centres can request visits from Mentors and Student Language Ambassadors and sessions can be in person or online.
- Centres can also apply for funding via Taith Hwb (gov.wales) to take part in educational international exchanges.
- You could also partner with a school in German-speaking country, for example, via the [British Council: Partner with a](https://www.britishcouncil.org/school-resources/partner)  [school.](https://www.britishcouncil.org/school-resources/partner) Learners could engage in a joint project with a German-speaking school focusing on elements of Theme 2 such as discussing the local impact of climate change or learning about each other's town. Aspects of Theme 3 could also be a focus for example**,** learners could share photos of school life on Padlet.

{25}------------------------------------------------

### engage with the language from a variety of sources and in a variety of genres and media

- Learners will have the opportunity to engage with the language from a variety of sources and in a variety of genres and media throughout the specification.
- It is vital to allow learners these opportunities so that they develop their creativity and self-expression through their German oracy. To support learners to express themselves for different purposes and audiences you could ensure that they are exposed to different text types, for example listening to or reading language which is designed to persuade, inform, instruct and recount. Learners may watch a short news report and then create and perform one of their own, perhaps linked to sustainability or the world of work. They could also plan and perform a chat show style question and answer session around keeping healthy or school life. You may also wish to use the selected literary text as a stimulus for learners to develop their own speaking work. They could, for example, create interviews with characters, record vlogs on themes/characters or create TikTok's on characters. Additionally, learners could listen to German podcasts and use these as a springboard to create and perform their own. Starting points could be:
  - <https://www.easygerman.org/podcast>
  - <https://slowgerman.com/>

### demonstrate language strategies and language learning skills, including the use of dictionaries

- Learners will have the opportunity to demonstrate language strategies and language learning skills, including the use of dictionaries throughout the specification.
- To allow learners to become increasingly independent in their language learning and to convey their own ideas and viewpoints it is essential that they develop sound dictionary skills, and this includes online dictionaries such as [dict.cc.](https://www.dict.cc/) Learners should be taught explicitly how to identify and search for nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs and how to apply these to their own writing and speaking work.
- Providing a consistent colour-coding system for parts of speech would support learners in their grammatical skills. Analysing how parts of a sentence fit together could be facilitated by colour-coding and could support learners in their own use of grammar.

{26}------------------------------------------------

### translanguaging • Learners will have the opportunity to use their translanguaging skills throughout the specification. • You may wish to provide activities which allow learners to work in Cymraeg/English, German and other languages the learners may speak to develop their German oracy. They could, for example, listen to a documentary in Cymraeg/English on a German-speaking actor/musician and subsequently complete a fact-file about them in German and present this to the class in German. Practising role play tasks would also allow learners to develop their translanguaging as they read instructions in Cymraeg/English and formulate appropriate statements or questions in German. • You could also use translanguaging to encourage the learners to make connections between German and other languages they make speak. make use of digital technology • Learners will have the opportunity to make use of digital technology in all units. • You could make use of digital technology in order for learners to gain greater understanding of German-speaking countries and communities and to encourage and motivate learners. Use of digital technology in language learning can also raise confidence levels. • Examples of digital platforms which could be used to support speaking and listening are Padlet, making a vlog, making a TikTok video, creation of avatars using [voki,](https://www.voki.com/) and Adobe Express can also be used to create characters and record sound. making appropriate connections with other parts of the curriculum to develop and deepen learners' bilingual and multilingual skills • Learners will be encouraged to make connections with other parts of the curriculum throughout their learning of German with cross-curricular connections to humanities subjects and of course with the other languages within the LLC Area of Learning Experience. • It is helpful to draw upon learners' understanding and skills in both English and Cymraeg to further develop their understanding and use of the German language. You could, for example, compare grammatical patterns such as the placement of adjectives in different languages or the use of formal and informal forms of address. Comparing and contrasting sound-spelling correspondence would also be worthwhile, as well as discussing the use and translation of

idioms in different languages.

# Opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales

### Curriculum for Wales Strands

### Cross-cutting Themes

**There are many opportunities to include Local, National & International Contexts and Sustainability in GCSE German. These opportunities are important to Learners because they allow learners to develop their curiosity about the German language and different cultures in German speaking countries, as well as gaining an understanding of the importance of international languages. It will help them to gain their own sense of linguistic and cultural identity within their own community and the wider world. Study of local, national and international context in Theme 2 will also give them a greater awareness of environmental issues and potential solutions.**

**Below are some examples of how Local, National & International Contexts and Sustainability can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

<span id="page-26-0"></span>Local, National & International Contexts and Sustainability

#### *Example*

- Learners could explore environmental issues and sustainability within Theme 2. Learners could, for example, research and provide a short presentation on recycling in a Germanspeaking country and compare this with their own area. This could be supported by a PowerPoint/Sway/photos/video.
- Learners could identify the advantages and disadvantages of public transport in their own region or town and compare this to a region or town in a German speaking country. They could consider aspects such as types of transport, cost and reliability. They could discuss this in pairs with the help of sentence starters to structure their conversations. Key vocabulary (Specification: Appendix B) and grammatical structures (Specification: Appendix A) would need to be taught in advance.

{28}------------------------------------------------

**There are many opportunities to include Human Rights Education and Diversity in GCSE German. These opportunities are important to Learners because learners will develop respect for languages spoken by others and empathise with other cultural identities, understanding similarities and differences.**

**Below are some examples of how Human Rights Education and Diversity can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### *Example*

### Human Rights Education and Diversity

- Based around Theme 1, learners could investigate the hobbies or food habits of young people in a German-speaking country to gain a greater sense of this aspect of their culture. They could , for example, research this through an online discussion with learners in a partner German-speaking country. Learners could then prepare and present similar information about their eating habits and those of their country.
- Learners could investigate the musical tastes of young people in a German-speaking country and investigate why this music is popular/the origins of the music. They could compare and contrast with the music they listen to. Learners could present their findings as a vlog or in the form of an interview which they script and record. Alternatively, they could present this in the form of an infographic.

| Listening                          | There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE German. These opportunities are important to Learners because they will develop effective listening skills to respond effectively to questions in different contexts. They will also be able to describe, narrate and express opinions in a range of contexts when speaking. Below are some examples of how Literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning: |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Learners could have access to a range of sentence starters to help them structure their ideas. Discussions could focus on the past, present and future tense.One partner could read a short extract from the selected literary text of Unit 2. The other partner could then identify which sentence is being read. This will support learners to develop their sound-spelling correspondence. |

### Cross-curricular Skills - Numeracy

Understanding the number system helps us to represent and compare relationships between numbers and quantities

**There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE German. These opportunities are important to Learners because they support learners to analyse numbers and the information they provide in real-life situations.**

**Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### *Example*

- As part of Theme 2, learners could analyse statistics which show the environmental impact of a local initiative and prepare bullet point sentences to share with the class as feedback.
- Within Theme 3, learners could read an article containing statistics about unemployment in the local area and present their findings in German. Learners could be provided with sentences starters to support their speaking work.

### Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competency

**There are many opportunities to include Digital Competency in GCSE German. These opportunities are important to Learners because they support learners to be collaborative communicators**

**Below are some examples of how Digital Competency can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### *Example*

Interacting and Collaborating

- Learners could engage in a series of online discussions with school pupils in a Germanspeaking country using Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or just in a written form using Padlet to provide information about themselves across the three Themes.
- Learners would make use of a wide variety of technology to share and present ideas orally to each other (Padlet, vlogs, TikTok, [Vocaroo,](https://vocaroo.com/) flip, [Canva,](https://www.canva.com/en_gb/?msockid=389e619d640f64dc1f9675d465496587) PowerPoint, voki, Adobe Creative). Chat GPT with the introduction of audio could also be used to support oral work.

They can do this by<br>employing rules of sound-spelling correspondence as well as, identifying time markers which<br>would indicate the past, present or future tense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Planning and Organisation             | There are many opportunities to include Planning and Organisation in GCSE German.<br>These opportunities are important to Learners because learners will learn to plan<br>information and ideas in a logical order and to reflect on and make improvements to their<br>speaking work. They will learn to manage the timing of their speaking work and identify<br>prompts and bullet points which will best support them in their speaking presentations.<br>Below are some examples of how Planning and Organisation can be embedded into<br>teaching and learning:                                                                                                                                                   |
|                                       | <b>Example</b><br>• Learners could read an example presentation and devise bullet points by identifying which<br>are the most important elements. In pairs, learners could use these bullet points to evaluate<br>how much of the presentation content they can speak about.<br>• Learners could plan a presentation on a topic of their choice by identifying key points,<br>researching important information and ensuring that their presentation contains a variety<br>of language which allows them to communicate information, describe and narrate<br>events. They could then arrange their ideas in a logical order and check that the<br>presentation complies with the time allocation set by their teacher. |
| Personal Effectiveness                | There are many opportunities to include Personal Effectiveness in GCSE German. These<br>opportunities are important to Learners because learners will gain confidence and<br>independence in their oracy.<br>Below are some examples of how Personal Effectiveness can be embedded into<br>teaching and learning:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|                                       | <b>Example</b><br>• Learners could record a vlog/TikTok video on healthy eating. They could then listen back to<br>their performances in pairs and evaluate the accuracy of their pronunciation by cross<br>checking with sound-spelling correspondence rules. Learners could identify any sound<br>spelling correspondence rules which they need to work on further in preparation for their next<br>oral activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

• Learners could write and perform a dialogue on what they do usually at the weekend in the present tense. They could then be asked to re-read the conversation but transferring it to the past tense. Following this oral work, learners could review their use of the past tense by referring to their grammar notes to make improvements to the accuracy of their past tense dialogues.
