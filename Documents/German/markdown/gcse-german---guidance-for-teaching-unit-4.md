#### Assessment details

Written examination: 1 hour 30 mins Set and marked by WJEC 35% of qualification 70 marks

This unit requires learners to respond to a range of questions with fixed responses and responses in Cymraeg/English, to translate short extracts from the assessed language into Cymraeg/English and to respond in the assessed language to a choice of written tasks.

The unit is divided into 2 sections – Section A and Section B. Each section will cover all broad themes.

In Section A, a reading task will provide the stimulus for the translation task. Translation in this context means a sufficient and appropriate rendering of the meaning of the original language.

Texts will only use the grammar and vocabulary specified in this specification. Words outside of the specification grammar and vocabulary lists will be glossed. For written production, the expected language will be from the specified content (vocabulary and grammar), with equal credit given for language used that is beyond the defined content but that fulfils the task requirements.

The Rubrics will be in Cymraeg/English.

Stimuli will be in the assessed language.

All responses will be non-verbal and in Cymraeg/English, apart from the response in Section B to the extended writing task.

**Learners are not permitted to use a dictionary in any part of the assessment.**

**Section A:** four comprehension questions and translation (AO2 – 30 marks)

Learners will read a range of texts linked to each of the broad themes:

- texts based on practical transactional language such as information notices and signs
- factual texts such as an e-mail, poster, web page, letter, newspaper article, flyer, graph, advert
- prose such as continuous literary texts, extracts from short stories, magazine articles.

Learners will demonstrate understanding of the texts by responding to a range of questions in Cymraeg/English. Question types will include: multiple choice questions, true/false with justification, matching words/phrases with definitions/images, matching statements with their source, short answers in Cymraeg/English, gap-fill, finish the sentences, comprehension questions to demonstrate understanding.

#### **Section B:**

Question 6 (35 marks) (AO2 – 20 marks) (AO3 – 15 marks)

Learners will write an extended piece of writing in response to written prompts. There will be a choice of three options in Cymraeg/English, one from each broad theme. Learners will respond to the question prompts writing up to a maximum of 120 words in the assessed language.

Include graphic organisers e.g. spider diagrams, to map out main ideas, supporting details, and relationships between different parts of the text.</li><li>Learners could match headlines, details, names to different parts of the text, e.g. 3 work placements: ask how much each place will pay, details about working hours, details about type of work.</li><li>Learners develop cross-curricular and integral skills in reading and writing tasks. Filling in tables with key points, noting details, completing sentences, or identifying opinions show literacy skills and require critical thinking, problem solving, planning and organisational skills.</li></ul> |  |

{10}------------------------------------------------

- Rather than ask learners specific questions about a fact, e.g. Where does the festival take place ? What are the opening times? Ask learners to give **two details** about the festival instead.
- Ensure that learners can identify a range of ways in which opinions can be expressed as well as draw conclusion. Teachers provide learners with a chart or Venn diagram where differing viewpoints will be noted. For instance, label column s *"Meinung von Person A"* and *"Meinung von Person B"*, and have learners fill in each person's opinions. Highlight opinions using different colo urs for positive/negative viewpoints (e.g., *"Einige glauben, dass Chatrooms nützlich sind "* vs. *"Andere sagen, dass Chatrooms gefährlich sein können "*). Learners should look out for conjunctions such as *weil, den n, obwohl* that will link into justifications and greater detail.
- Teach tenses in the reading texts by focusing on verb endings, sentence structures and adverbs of time. Learners could be asked to underline/highlight verbs in a sentence/text in a range of tenses e.g. *Letzte Woche habe ich mit meiner Freundin Hockey gespielt*. *Normalerweise gehe ich ins Schwimmbad aber nächste Woche werde ich mit meiner Mutter ins Fitnessstudio gehen*. Highlighting different tenses will show the position of verbs as well as the need for the auxiliary verb *haben* + past participle (mostly ge -t / ge -en) in the past tense and *werden* + infinitive for the future tense.
- A timeline will help learners to identify tenses more easily. An example could be: **als ich klein war – früher – letztes Jahr – letzte Woche – gestern – heute – heute Abend – morgen – übermorgen – nächste s Wochenende – nach der Schule – in der Zukunft.** More adverbs of time can be added throughout the course.

{11}------------------------------------------------

- Learner s will be asked to translate full sentences into Cymraeg/English within the context of a text. They need to develop a structure d approach of fine -reading skills to translate details correctly incl. vocabulary, correct tenses, adverbs and complex structures , i.e. *um…zu* .
- Translation is about conveying meaning, not just translating word -for word. It is important to understand the message and context behind the original text. Teacher s could provide sentences that don't translate literally (idioms, metaphors, cultural expressions) and ask learners to find equivalent phrases in English. For example, *"Es ist mir egal"* in German translates as *"I don't care,"* not *"It is to me equal" .*
- Expose learners to different types of texts (narrative, factual, journalistic, literary). Each type requires different translation techniques and styles. Discuss how style and purpose of the text affect translation choices. For example, factual texts require precise language, while literary texts may allow for more creative interpretation.

Strategies that could be used in the classroom:

- Learners could be given "part translations" with parts of the text in German and parts are in English (gap -fill).
- Learners break down complex German sentences into subject -verb object (highlight in different colours) and translate, focusing on the placement of verbs and other structural elements.
- Faulty – translations': Provide learners with a German text alongside an English translation (e.g. a paragraph from a book or an article). Ask learners to compare the translations and find intentional errors.
- Translation Pyramid : Start with a basic sentence, add adjectives, adverbs, relative clause, conjunctions etc. to break up complex sentence structures:
  - *Alex hat einen Bruder.*

{12}------------------------------------------------

- 1. *Alex hat einen kleinen Bruder.*
- 2. *Alex hat einen sehr kleinen Bruder, der sportlich ist.*
- 3. *Alex hat einen sehr kleinen Bruder, der ziemlich sportlich ist.*
- 4. *Alex hat einen sehr kleinen Bruder, der ziemlich sportlich ist, weil er jeden Tag joggen geht.*
- 5. *Alex hat einen sehr kleinen Bruder, der ziemlich sportlich ist, weil er jeden Tag im Park joggen geht .*
- The writing exam include s all three broad themes. Marks will be allocated for AO2 Strand 2: Understand and respond to written language in writing [20 marks] and AO3: Demonstrate knowledge and accurate application of the grammar and vocabulary prescribed in the specification [15 marks].
- The meaning of a text must be conveyed without ambiguity. Responses should be extended, and ideas and points of view must be consistently developed. Grammar should be taught in context and used regularly. Provide enough time to practise grammar.
- Encourage learners to use integral skills i.e. creativity, planning and organisation, innovation, and write different types of text – formal, informal, letters, emails, articles, blogs, stories, poems, song texts etc. Ensure that learners can refer to past, present and future events in writing. Practise expressing opinions and giving details in writing.

#### Strategies to include in lessons are:

- Learners could be asked to develop ideas by finishing sentence parts. Discuss answers from several learner s to collect a range of responses , e.g . *Man soll viel Obst essen, weil …(es gut für die Gesundheit ist/gut für das Herz ist/fit macht/es gesund ist/der Gesundheit hilft)*.
- Encourage learners to write different types of text – formal, informal, letters, emails, articles, blogs, etc. related to the 3 broad themes. Texts can range from short responses to extended answers.

{13}------------------------------------------------

- Practise expressing opinions in writing and with details. Teach useful phrases for expressing opinions such as *Ich glaube, dass...Meiner Meinung nach... Es ist wichtig, weil...* Encourage learners to give arguments for and against a topic such as school uniforms or social media, before concluding with their personal viewpoint.
- Ping -Pong: Learners can work in pairs: Learner A gives an opinion , e.g. *Ich mag die Schulun iform.* Learner B needs to justify the opinion e.g. *Ich mag die Uniform, weil sie bequem ist* . Then learner B gives opinions that Learner A has to justify.
- Sentence -Swap: Learners are asked to write an opinion + justification related to a specific topic on a piece of paper. They then read it out to other learners in the class – each time swapping their answers. Learners will be exposed to a range of answers.
- Use knowledge of vocabulary and grammar to communicate meaningfully, using more complex structures which reference past, present and future events where appropriate.
- Ensure that grammar is learnt often and in small chunks. Teach it in context and encourage learners to use it regularly. Point out grammar , i.e. verb endings , in functional and situational contexts.
- Ensure that grammar is clear, simple and relevant to learners and that they understand grammatical terms i.e. past participle, auxiliary verb, modal verb.
- When teaching the perfect tense start with *haben* + regular past participles , e.g. *ich habe gespielt, ich habe gemacht.* Then introduce different personal pronouns e.g. *er hat gespielt* before moving to *haben* + irregular verbs e.g. *ich habe gegessen, sie hat getrunken* . Introduce the *sein* + past participles last, e.g. *ich bin gefahren, er ist gegangen*.

{14}------------------------------------------------

Strategies to practise past tense in German are here:

- Blankety-Blank: Start a sentence e.g. *Ich habe im Park* ... (*Fußball gespielt / ein Picknick gemacht / Freunde getroffen* etc.) A choice of answers could be displayed on the board or learners can write their own answers. Points can be awarded to the learner who guessed/is closest to the teacher's answer.
- Try and encourage learners to use the language creatively. An example for creative use of the future tense is a rock-climbing activity (starting from the bottom upwards – where there is a question mark, candidates use their own choice of vocabulary):

| ?         | essen.   | spielen.       | fahren.    | gehen.    |
|-----------|----------|----------------|------------|-----------|
| Tennis | ? | nach London | in Cardiff | schwimmen |
| am Montag | mit Anna | eine Pizza     | ?          | im Sommer |
| Ich werde | Ich will | Ich möchte     | Alex wird  | ?         |

- free "Leseprobe" for literature extract.

Learners will be required to read a range of texts linked to each of the broad themes including:

- texts based on practical transactional language such as information notices and signs
- factual texts such as an e-mail, poster, web page, letter, newspaper article, flyer, graph, advert
- prose such as continuous literary texts, extracts from short stories, magazine articles.
- Learners need to respond to texts with verbal and non-verbal responses.
- Factual texts related to the 3 broad themes and prose can be found following the links in the previous section. Texts should be adapted to suit the level of learners and to comply with the WJEC grammar and vocabulary list.

{15}------------------------------------------------

Once adapted, reading skills can be practise using the following activities: • For short texts/graphs/notices/signs/adverts: focus on key vocabulary to identify the overall message. E.g. compare 2 adverts for similar products e.g. healthy snacks. Create a table with information for product A, product B and information that apply to both. • For extended texts (max 200 words) learner A and B (or split the class in group A/B) could be given very similar texts with the opposite person filling the gaps e.g: • *Peter macht ein Praktikum bei einer Firma in der Schweiz. Er ist jeden Tag in einem Büro und muss am Computer arbeiten.* • *Hanne macht ein Praktikum bei einer Firma in Süddeutschland. Sie ist jeden Tag in einem Büro und muss mit Kunden telefonieren.* • Learner A asks Learner B question related to the texts e.g. *Wer macht ein Praktikum? Wo macht er/sie das Praktikum? Was macht er/sie im Praktikum?* and notes the answers. Learners will be required to: • demonstrate understanding of the texts by responding to a range of questions in Cymraeg/English • translate sentences into Cymraeg/English within a context • write in German in response to a stimulus. • Vary activities from answering questions in Cymraeg/English, longer texts could be summarised by matching the beginning of sentences with the end, e.g. create a list 1-5 and match with list A-E. • Learners complete sentences in Cymraeg/English, e.g. *Lena uses her mobile to …. (what?) She bought her new mobile phone … (when?)*. • To practise translation into Cymraeg/English learners are given the first letter of each word, e.g. *Noah arbeitet für eine Firma in Wien. – N(oah) w(orks) f(or) a c(ompany) i(n) V(ienna).*

{16}------------------------------------------------

- Show learners that texts cannot be translated word-for-word by focusing on word order. A "faulty" translation could be presented that must be corrected by learners, e.g. *Letzten Sommer hat Mila ihre Familie in Frankfurt besucht. – Last Summer has Mila her family in Frankfurt visited.*
- To write in response to a specific stimulus, learners need to organise ideas and show creativity. Focus on one aspect e.g. the free time activity "swimming". Write as much detail as possible by considering the following questions: **What? When? Where? With whom? How often? How do you get there? Why? Last time? Next time?**
- Familiar language allows learners now to extend their answer: *Ich schwimme gern. Ich schwimme jeden Samstag im Schwimmbad in der Stadtmitte. Ich gehe mit meiner Schwester ins Schwimmbad. Wir schwimmen viermal im Monat. Mein Vater fährt uns im Auto zum Schwimmbad. Ich mag Schwimmen, weil es Spass macht und gut für meine Gesundheit ist. Letzte Woche war es sehr warm und ich bin im Meer geschwommen. Nächste Woche werde ich mit dem Bus ins Schwimmbad fahren, weil mein Vater keine Zeit hat.*
- Learners are given a list of 3-10 words (depending on the length of expected answer) that must be included in their answers.
- Alternatively, ask learners to write a response of a minimum (or even the exact) amount of words, e.g. *Was kann man in x machen? (+12 words/ exactly 20 words) Man kann am Wochenende einen guten Film im Kino sehen oder im Restaurant in der Stadtmitte mit der Familie essen*.

- Translanguaging Learners will have the opportunity to use their translanguaging skills, throughout the specification.
  - Encourage learners to compare German terms with equivalents in their first languages. E.g. have one sentence using several languages: *Ich have a Matka und dy enw di yw Hannah.*
  - Learners have 2 texts in different languages side-by-side and compare structures and vocabulary, e.g. word order after conjunctions:
    - *Ich mag Mathe, weil es interessant ist.*
    - *I like maths because it is interesting.*
    - *Dw i'n hoffi mathemateg achos mae'n ddiddorol.*

| Cross-curricular Skills – Literacy |  |  |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
|  | There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE German. These opportunities are important to Learners because GCSE German integrates essential reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills with broader learning strategies that are transferable across subjects. Below are some examples of how Literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning: |  |
|                                       | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |  |
| Reading | <ul><li>Learners are able to develop critical reading strategies, identifying key ideas, comparing and contrasting, drawing conclusions from text.</li></ul> |  |
|  | <ul><li>Learners respond to written texts related to all broad themes.</li></ul> |  |
|  | <ul><li>They are presented with 2 texts related to the same broad theme and identify differences and similarities e.g. Who is in …? Who does …? Who likes …?</li></ul> |  |
|  | <ul><li>Give learners a medium length text (no more than 80-100 words) and ask them to identify key ideas by highlighting vocabulary that is linked to this specific points e.g. Lukas war letztes Jahr mit seiner Familie in Spanien. Sie sind mit dem Flugzeug geflogen und haben in einem Hotel gewohnt. > Urlaub.</li></ul> |  |
|  | <ul><li>Learners develop their academic and subject-specific vocabulary and learn to recognise cognates in extended texts. Focus on what the learners understand – not on what they don't know.</li></ul> |  |
|  | <ul><li>It is important to use terminology accurately and familiarise learners with grammatical terms such as subject, pronoun, adjective, conjunction. A quick-fire-round at the beginning or end of the lesson can reinforce this e.g. ask learners: What part of speech is "spielen"?, or Name a subordinating conjunction.</li></ul> |  |
|                                       | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |  |
| Writing | <ul><li>Develop learners' ability to write in different formats, such as letters, essays, reports, and stories. Use arguments, adapt the tone and style for different audiences, plan and organise written work.</li></ul> |  |
|  | <ul><li>Assign writing tasks that require learners to use different registers of language (formal vs. informal) and structure their thoughts coherently.</li></ul> |  |

{25}------------------------------------------------

For instance, learners write a **formal letter of complaint** in German (also useful in Business Studies) or a **narrative story** about a personal experience (similar to creative writing tasks in English).

- Start the lesson by collecting vocabulary related to a specific theme. Write simple sentences using the vocabulary before introducing more complex language i.e. justification and detail. Combine the previous simple sentences with more complex language. Write a brief structural outline of the extended written task:
  - **Introduction** e.g. environmental problems in your area
  - **Main part** e.g. discuss environmental problems in more detail and suggest how to improve the situation
  - **Conclusion**: Summarise the key points and state your opinion on whether enough is done to protect the environment.
- It is important to provide learners with a writing frame including useful sentence starters and transitional phrase e.g. *In meiner Stadt gibt es … Meiner Meinung nach … Ich denke, dass…* Many of these sentence starters/transitional phrases can be used across themes.

{26}------------------------------------------------

#### **Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy**

**There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE German. These opportunities are important to Learners because numeracy is essential in everyday life and including it in German reading and writing tasks prepares learners for practical, real-world situations in a German-speaking environment.**

**Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### *Example*

• Numeracy skills such as handling numbers, interpreting data, and understanding time and measurements can be included into German lessons to enhance learners' overall academic development.

Understanding the number system helps us to represent and compare relationships between numbers and quantities

- Understanding data related to travel. Learners are presented with flight timetables and hotel information (dates of stay, cost) which will enhance their data handling skill.
- Give learners a budget for a trip to a German speaking country e.g.350 Euro. Ask them to plan the trip including certain criteria e.g. flight times, location of the hotel, facilities in the hotel. Learners need to have access to a range of data for this task that allow them to compare and contrast the required information.
- Include numeracy is in shopping scenarios where learners have to work out costs of multiple items, payments, currency conversion and change.
- Reading and interpreting percentages, proportions, and statistics while reinforcing relevant vocabulary, can be practised with graphs related to all broad themes, e.g. use a graph how much time is spent on social media. Step 1 is to understand the data before analysing (step 2) and evaluating (step 3) it. For example:
  - *Step 1: Jugendliche unter 18 Jahren verbringen etwa 5 Stunden täglich in sozialen Medien.*
  - *Step 2: Sie gehen auf TikTok, um Videos zu sehen oder chatten by Snapchat mit Freunden.*
  - *Step 3: Ich denke, dass soziale Medien wichtig sind weil man einfach mit Menschen in der ganzen Welt in Kontakt bleiben kann*.

#### **Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competence**

**There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE German. These opportunities are important to Learners because they help learners to use digital tools to communicate in German, collaborate on tasks, and explore the language and culture interactively. This not only enhances their language skills but also prepares them for a world where digital collaboration is essential.**

**Below are some examples of how Digital Competence can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### *Example*

• Develop writing skills in German while collaborating in real-time using digital platforms.

# Interacting and Collaborating

- Assign a group writing task where learners work together to create a German text, such as an article, dialogue, or short story, using a shared Google Docs file. Each learner can contribute sections and edit others' work in real-time*.* Provide each member of the group with 1 aspect of the task e.g. A. Write about the main character (physical description), B. Location C. Secondary character D. Actions
- Learners use digital tools to correct and edit together, giving feedback in the comments, and interacting in a shared online space. For this provide learners with 3 texts – excellent, medium, weak skills. Learners should pick up good and poor practice and share their findings through comments/emails/online editing (track changes) etc.
- Learners create a presentation on Germany's regional diversity, with each learner presenting on a different region (e.g., Bavaria, Saxony, or Hamburg). Learners research the culture, dialect, and tourist attractions of their assigned region and present in German. Learners use digital tools to write and edit together, giving feedback in the comments, and interacting in a shared online space. They also need to verify their sources.

#### *Example*

• Learners create a short digital story using tools like **Adobe Spark**, **Canva**, or **Animoto**. They write a narrative in German, incorporating images, audio, and video clips.

#### Producing

• Present the digitally created stories to the class, allowing learners to practice speaking and listening skills while engaging with digital media.

{28}------------------------------------------------

- Learners create a digital portfolio using platforms like **Google Sites** or **Seesaw**, where they upload various pieces of work (essays, recordings, projects) completed throughout the year. This is a useful revision tool and shows learners their progression throughout the course.
- Learners create a survey using **Google Forms** or **SurveyMonkey** on a topic relevant to their peers (e.g., favourite hobbies, environmental awareness). They share the survey, complete their peers'. Analyse and present their findings in German.

{29}------------------------------------------------

#### **Integral Skills**

**There are many opportunities to include Creativity and Innovation in GCSE German. These opportunities are important to Learners because it enhances learners' engagement and encourage deeper learning.**

**Below are some examples of how Creativity and Innovation can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### *Example*

• Encourage learners to write short stories, poems, or dialogues in German based on prompts related to their interests or current theme studied.

#### Creativity and Innovation

- Give a prompt like *"Stell dir vor, du bist ein Reiseleiter in der Schweiz."* Learners create a narrative around their experiences or write a persuasive text advocating accommodation, travel, sights, weather, activities.
- Learners design a poster about their local area, using German phrases and vocabulary related to the topic. Alternatively, they illustrate a poem they write.
  - *In meiner Stadt gibt es viele Geschäfte,*
  - *hier kaufe ich meine Schulhefte,*
  - *grüne Parks sind toll für Sport und Spiel,*
  - *hier gibt es Blumen, so bunt und viel*.
- Learners rewrite the lyrics of a popular song to reflect a topic they've studied or create an original song about their daily lives. Examples on YouTube – please check suitability before use. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4OfBez9V38&list=PLje9vCS0nNM\\_mnHkZpf-lW-5czs9IZVyl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4OfBez9V38&list=PLje9vCS0nNM_mnHkZpf-lW-5czs9IZVyl)

{30}------------------------------------------------

# Critical Thinking and Problem Solving **There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE German. These opportunities are important to Learners because reading and writing tasks enhance learners' language skills while encouraging them to think analytically, evaluate information, and solve real-world challenges Below are some examples of how Critical Thinking and Problem Solving can be embedded into teaching and learning:** *Example* • Analyse arguments, construct logical reasoning, and evaluate opposing viewpoints will be developed. • Organise a debate where learners are divided into teams to argue for or against a statement (e.g., "X ist ein fantastischer Ort für Touristen" – "In X gibt es nichts Interessantes für Touristen"). Provide prompts and vocabulary relevant to the topic to support each group's discussions. • Assign a group project on one of the themes (e.g. differences in the school system in Germany and Wales). Learners research, analyse, and present their findings. Planning and Organisation **There are many opportunities to include Planning and Organisation in GCSE German. These opportunities are important to Learners because learning will be structured and applied in various contexts. Below are some examples of how Planning and Organisation can be embedded into teaching and learning:** *Example* • Create an outline with a clear introduction, main points, and conclusion. • Ask learners to plan a budget for a weekend trip to Munich, including transport, accommodation, and meals, in German. Ask them to justify their decisions. • Learners write texts about specific topics (e.g., jobs, food). They should: • Prepare key phrases and key vocabulary in advance. • Which grammar will be included? Tenses? Conjunctions? • Organise thoughts in a clear way to ensure coherent communication and no ambiguities. • Develop their ability to think ahead and structure their written work.

{31}------------------------------------------------

**There are many opportunities to include Personal Effectiveness in GCSE German. These opportunities are important to Learners because they help develop skills that are valuable both inside and outside the classroom. Personal Effectiveness includes abilities such as self-management, goal setting, resilience, and reflective thinking.**

**Below are some examples of how Personal Effectiveness can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

#### *Example*

• At the beginning of each term or unit, learners set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals for their German language learning.

#### Personal Effectiveness

- Teachers allow learners to set their own goals. E.g. I*ch möchte bis zum (Datum) 100 neue Wörter lernen.* Revisit these goals regularly to assess progress, discuss challenges, and adjust goals as necessary.
- Teach learners how to plan their study time effectively. Use a weekly planner to help allocate time for vocabulary practice, grammar exercises, and revision for tests. Learners fill out a planner for a week and reflect on their effectiveness in sticking to it.
- Encourage reflective thinking by allowing learners to ask themselves:
  - *Was habe ich gut gemacht?*
  - *Worauf bin ich stolz?*
  - *Was denkt mein(e) Lehrer(in) darüber?*
  - *Was kann ich besser machen?*
