MARK SCHEME

Guidance for examiners

Generic marking principles

•  Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).

•  Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when
these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme.
The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.

•  Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the
question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of
the candidate responses seen).

•  Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks

should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

Positive marking

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit
should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising
the candidate for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to achieve full
marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be deducted for a less than
perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied precisely.
Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates’ answers. The list is not
exhaustive. The inclusion of ‘Credit any other valid response.’ (or similar instruction) within mark
schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates’ responses. Credit should be given
according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates’ answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However, unless
there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks where the
answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

Banded mark schemes

For band marked questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the
assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in
candidates’ answers.  It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate’s response. As noted
above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive, and candidates do not have to
include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

WJEC GCSE Food and Nutrition  Unit 1 Sample External Assessment

© WJEC CBAC Ltd 2024.

2

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the
requirements of the highest mark band.  Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it
contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been
provided, no marks should be awarded.

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each
candidate’s response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills,
knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors or
omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate’s answer to pick out the evidence that is
being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied.  This is done as a two-
stage process.

Stage 1 – Deciding on the band

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate’s answer and check
whether it matches the descriptors for that band.  If the descriptors at the lowest band are
satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band
until the descriptors match the answer.

If an answer covers different aspects of different bands within the mark scheme, a ‘best fit’
approach should be adopted to decide on the band and then the candidate’s response should
be used to decide on the mark within the band.  For instance, if a response is mainly in band 2
but with a limited amount of band 3 content, the answer would be placed in band 2, but the mark
awarded would be close to the top of band 2 as a result of the band 3 content.

Examiners should not seek to mark candidates down as a result of small omissions in minor
areas of an answer.

Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark

During standardising (the marking conference), detailed advice from the Principal Examiner on
the qualities of each mark band will be given.  Examiners will then receive examples of answers
in each mark band that have been awarded a mark by the Principal Examiner. Examiners
should mark the examples and compare their marks with those of the Principal Examiner.

When marking, examiners can use these examples to decide whether a candidate’s response is
of a superior, inferior or comparable standard to the example.  Examiners are reminded of the
need to revisit the answer as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and
the mark allocated is appropriate to the response provided.

(d)   Discuss the environmental impacts associated with intensive farming.

Answers may refer to the following:

Indicative content

Increased food miles – due to large quantities of food being transported over long distances
from large-scale production hubs, increasing air pollution.

Water pollution – the use of fertilizers associated with intensive farming can lead to chemicals
washing into nearby rivers and lakes, harming aquatic life.

Lowers biodiversity – farmers may remove hedgerows to create larger fields to allow them to
farm in an intensive way, leading to a decrease in biodiversity.

Greenhouse gas emissions – intensive livestock farming increases with amount of methane in
the environment which contributes to global warming.

Increase water use – due to the high levels of irrigation which can deplete local water
resources.

Fossil Fuel Use: Intensive farming relies heavily on machines and chemicals that require fossil
fuels, leading to higher carbon emissions.

Question  Answer

7.

Elis has recently moved back to Wales and wants to eat more Welsh produce.

Assess the advantages and disadvantages of Elis buying food locally.

Indicative content

Answers may refer to the following:

Advantages

Environmental benefits

•  By buying food more locally, Elis is being more environmentally friendly as this can reduce
the amount of food miles associated with the transportation of food. This can reduce the
amount of carbon emissions associated with food being imported from other countries
which often uses lorries, shipping containers and even air freight.

•  By buying food more locally, Elis is being more environmentally friendly as this can reduce
the amount of plastic waste. Food sold locally is likely to have less packaging, as it tends
to be fresh food, this can of reduce the amount of plastic entering landfills and oceans,
thereby protecting wildlife and ecosystems.

•  By purchasing food locally, Elis is encouraging sustainable agricultural practices. Local

farmers often use environmentally friendly farming techniques, such as crop rotation and
organic farming, which can lead to healthier soils, reduced pesticide use, and better
preservation of local biodiversity, contributing to environmental sustainability.

Economic benefits

•  By buying food locally, Elis is supporting local growers, farmers, and producers. This

support can boost the local economy by creating jobs, contributing to economic growth,
and ensuring that more money circulates within the community, benefiting local
businesses and services.

Fresh/seasonal ingredients

•  By shopping locally possibly in farmers markets, Ellis will benefit from fresh/seasonal
ingredients, with a higher nutritional value as they are picked at the peak of ripeness
leading to better quality as it does not need long storage as not having to travel long
distances. Seasonal foods are often more flavourful and could add more variety to his
daily / weekly diet.

•  By shopping locally, Elis may be more adventurous with food and cooking, as a person
who buys locally has to purchase what is available seasonally or available on the day.
This could encourage Elis to eat a more varied variety of foods, which are often grown

Disadvantages

Higher cost

•  Buying food locally could be more expensive for Elis. The cost of the produce could be

more due to produce/goods being produced on a smaller scale which could involve many
growing/making processes being done by hand.   This can lead to increased labour costs
and smaller production volumes, resulting in higher prices compared to mass-produced
goods.

Restricted choices

•  Elis may not be able to get the produce Elis would like locally due to the inconsistent

weather patterns in Wales, there could be a restricted range of things that can be reared /
grown locally. Elis may not be able to rely on suppliers, who may not be able to produce
enough to meet demand. This may mean Elis is less able to plan weekly menus due to
the unknown availability of food.

Increased food waste

•  Buying local produce can sometimes lead to increased food waste. Locally sourced food
often comes with shorter shelf lives since it is fresh and free from preservatives. This can
result in produce spoiling more quickly if not used promptly. This can lead to food being
thrown out if it is not used in time.

Credit any other acceptable response.

Appendix A – WJEC Food and Nutrition Digital Assessment

Digital Assessment Information

1.  Arrangements and access of the digital examination:

Digital examinations will be delivered to centres through Surpass software. An
application named WJEC SecureClient will need to be installed on candidate’s PC’s
within centres so that candidates can complete the exams. The Surpass software will be
available throughout the academic year and centres will be encouraged to complete
practice exams (e.g. Digital Specimen Assessment Materials and past papers as they
become available) using the on-screen assessment software so that candidates can
familiarise themselves with the software in readiness for the live exams.

2.  Controls within digital examination:

Centre staff will need to:
•  modify the duration of on-screen exams for candidates that require additional time

(access arrangements)

•  ensure invigilators can log into Surpass to be able to pause and resume exams

during the delivery of on-screen exams. Used for candidates who have supervised
rest breaks (access arrangements) and for individual or cohort issues that may occur
during live exams e.g. disruption.

Candidates will have the ability to:
•  change the colour preferences of the on-screen exam.
•  zoom in/out functionality.

3.  Candidate instructions for digital examinations:

Centres will be provided with a Candidate User Guide for candidates completing on-
screen assessments. The Surpass software will be available throughout the academic
year and centres will be encouraged to complete practice exams (e.g. Digital Specimen
Assessment Materials and past papers as they become available) using the on-screen
assessment software so that candidates can familiarise themselves with the software in
readiness for the live exams.

4.  Digital examination arrangements – clarity over support:

Live exams will be scheduled by WJEC at least 7 days before the date of the exam. The
‘Home ’screen of Surpass will contain information to assist with the installation and
testing of the software as well as a user guide detailing the administration process of
delivering on-screen exams within a centre.
