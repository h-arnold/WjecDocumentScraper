Learners should be given opportunities to investigate the working characteristics of ingredients through completing practical work and understand the science behind what they have seen from the practical work/investigation. Learners should be given the opportunity to investigate cooking methods and heat transfer and to explore how all food commodities change during cooking. One example would be how protein foods coagulate and change in colour and shape and how protein can determine the texture of foods. Example activities: <ul><li>Learners could investigate the working characteristics of ingredients. This could be done through e.g. making butter and cheese to understand the working characteristic of emulsions or making mayonnaise to understand the science of emulsions and using a viscosity chart to assess the outcomes.</li><li>Learners could investigate how wheat, salt and ph. can influence the outcome of recipes by using ice water to blanch vegetables after steaming to retain colour and maximum Vitamin C.</li><li>Learners could use a munsel chart as a resource, to measure the outcome of caramelisation of shortbread and understand how the caramelisation of sugars are used to produce rich brown colours and flavours.</li><li>Teachers could plan a practical lesson using a recipe, such as a Swiss</li></ul> |  |

## 2.1.2 The functional properties of ingredients in a recipe

Learners should understand the functional properties of ingredients in a recipe, including:

- aerating
- binding
- bulking
- colouring
- flavouring
- glazing
- modifying nutritional content
- preserving
- raising agents
- setting
- tenderising
- thickening.

Learners should understand the function of ingredients in a recipe, by:

- selecting and adapting recipes
- considering variables that affect results
- making modifications to a recipe.

Heat transfer: conduction convection and radiation and use examples of each method through practical lessons Demonstrate the stages of certain cooking processes, like melting sugar, and explain how flavours, colours, and textures change with each stage. Learners could make a story board of the process within each recipe.

It is important for learners to define key terms and know the definitions of functional food properties such as those listed to the left. Teachers can explain why understanding these functional properties is essential in the preparation, making, cooking and storing of food.

#### **Example activities:**

Hands on experiments such as whipping egg whites to demonstrate how air is incorporated creating volume and foams. These could then be used to make meringues to avoid food waste.

Explore methods of preserving and conduct a taste test preserved versus fresh e.g. could use fresh fruit as readily available, freezing, jam making or beetroot – fresh versus pickled.

Show videos that highlight the various processes and discuss how the food industry rates the importance of these properties in food production and food safety.

Conduct tasting session/show flash cards which show different products so that learners can identify the functional properties in the product. This could be paired work or group work.

Breaking down recipes and discussing the roles of the ingredients and grouping ingredients into categories such as preserving, bulking, binding, emulsifying. Carry out practical cooking sessions and encourage Learners to observe the scientific changes, questioning what happens to each ingredient as they cook. For example, what happens to the egg when making an egg custard tart, quiche lorraine. Create charts of the cooking process, before during and after, could include images at the different stages to highlight the impact that each function has on the outcome of the product.

{7}------------------------------------------------

#### **Example activities:**

Create a practical challenge where Learners must use certain ingredients in a specific way linking their knowledge of ingredients in their practical skills combing the science with flair and creativity.

Use a simple recipe, like pancakes, and explain the purpose of each ingredient (e.g. flour gives structure, eggs help bind, sugar adds sweetness). Ask deeper thinking questions "What do you think would happen if we left out an ingredient?"

Take a recipe such as shortbread and ask students to make it gluten-free, vegan, or low-sugar. Compare the results and discuss what's different.

Group work: Make a recipe such as cookies with one group baking at a higher temperature and another at a lower one. Look at the differences and discuss why they happened.

Use a simple recipe such as pancakes and have students try using more or less of one ingredient, such as flour or sugar. Discuss which version worked best and why.

{8}------------------------------------------------

#### 2.1.3 The chemical properties of ingredients in a recipe

Learners should understand the chemical properties of ingredients in a recipe, by:

- selecting and adapting recipes
- considering variables that affect results.

Learners should be aware of recipes that demonstrate specific characteristics, including:

#### **Carbohydrates:**

- caramelisation
- dextrinization
- gelatinisation
- Maillard reaction.

#### **Fats and oils:**

- aeration: steam, chemical and mechanical action
- emulsification
- plasticity
- shortening or flakiness.

#### **Fruits and vegetables:**

- enzymic browning
- oxidisation.

#### **Protein:**

- complementary actions
- coagulation
- denaturation: acid, heat and mechanical action
- foam formation
- gelation
- gluten formation
- Maillard reaction
- stabilisation
- viscosity.

Learners need to understand the chemical properties of ingredients within a recipe and the variables that affect a recipe are crucial for achieving consistent and desirable outcomes.

Learners should be encouraged to define key terminology by explaining terms, such as ph. and acidity and how the chemical properties affect flavour, colour and texture. Teachers should give learners an introduction of common chemical reactions that take place in cooking, such as caramelisation and gelatinisation.

Learners should be given the opportunity to discuss how changing an ingredient or method can alter the outcome and be able to identify key variables of time, temperature and ingredient. For example, the time in fermentation. Discuss how changing an ingredient or method can alter the outcome.

Provide explanations of the chemistry behind the reactions such as the stages of melting sugar.

#### **Example activities:**

- Teachers could share with learners a range of failed recipes and encourage learners to analyse the recipes to identify which variables may have contributed to the undesired outcomes.
- Teachers and/or learners could make a range of gels from flours and use a viscosity mass to discuss the consistency of the sauce.
- Learners could observe toast being made and explain the process of dextrinization and dry heat.
- Learners could make notes on a teacher demonstration of the specific characteristics of caramelisation and making brittle.
- Learners could investigate the shortening properties of a variety of fats, lards, butters etc. and measure the flashiness of each fat in a batch of shortcrust pastry.

| 2.2.1 Planning a food investigation | Learners should understand the stages of a food investigation plan, including: <ul><li>research question</li><li>developing a hypothesis</li><li>identifying variables</li><li>experimental controls</li><li>equipment required</li><li>collecting results</li><li>analysing results</li><li>presenting investigation results</li><li>drawing conclusions</li><li>evaluating results. Learners should be aware of sustainability practices to prevent food waste when conducting a food investigation.</li></ul> | This can be approached like a science investigation as a food scientist would work in the food industry. Mini-investigations can be carried out throughout the course, such as investigating the role of sugar in a biscuit, investigating how the use of different flours or fats affects the quality of shortcrust pastry and what ingredients make the best shortbread. Example activities A simple approach could be taken with parts of the making process in a recipe such as investigating the browning reactions in fruit and vegetables (enzymic browning) or from flour (dextrinization) to a full investigation on the success of using different flours when making bread. A "mock" assessment could be undertaken, if time allows, using one set commodity/recipe or part "mini" assessment using different commodities/recipes. Teaching sustainability practices to prevent waste during cooking experiments is essential in fostering good habits in learners. Teachers can encourage discussions on the impact of food waste on the environment and its consequences, use statistics and data, or news stories to highlight the impact and why it matters. Example activities: Recipes should be planned mindfully, for example: <ul><li>choose recipes with a longer shelf life i.e. that produce using outcomes that can be tested a few days later, or use ingredients that have a longer shelf life so they can be used again</li><li>use seasonal and local ingredients</li><li>scale down recipes, if necessary</li><li>using the whole or part of ingredients</li><li>creatively using leftovers</li></ul> |  |

#### 2.2.2 The role of variables in a food experiment

Learners should understand the role of variables in a food experiment, including:

- cooking methods
- cooking times
- ingredients
- preparation methods
- quantities
- temperatures.

Learners should understand how to modify variables within a food experiment to test a hypothesis.

<span id="page-11-0"></span>Learners should be aware of the complimentary actions of ingredients in a recipe.

• the tracking of waste can generate discussions and encourage learners to think about how this can be reduced in future activities.

Learners should understand the steps of carrying out experiments and how to modify variables in food experiments to test the hypothesis understanding the type of variables will help guiding through the process: independent, dependent and controlled variables. The hypothesis should be clear for example if the sugar content of shortbread is increased, it will be browner, sweeter and chewier.

#### **Example activities**

Investigate the impact on nutritional value of the various cooking methods/cooking times of boiling, steaming, baking etc. learners produce an extended piece of writing and produce a written report.

Research how people can have individual preferences on how food is cooked, conduct experiment on preference of method e.g. steaming over boiling.

Allow learners to experiment with recipes, changing one ingredient at a time and could be group work, encourage substitutions such as honey in a cake recipe. Create variable charts listing the independent, dependent and controlled variable this helps visualise the experiment.

Encourage learners to concentrate on one variable at a time, and relevant to their hypothesis, if the hypothesis is on ratios the focus should be on the ratios.

Demonstrate how the roles of ingredients come together in a recipe such as pancakes, explaining each ingredient, such as flour giving the pancake structure, sugar sweetening the batter etc. What would happen if there was no sugar? What would happen to the batter if it was put int the oven instead of fried? Explore pairings of ingredients such as garlic and butter, tomatoes and basil. Encourage learners to substitute ingredients such as honey instead of sugar and discuss the effects.

{12}------------------------------------------------

#### **Example activities:**

Engage learners to research and present on different ingredient pairings, discussing how these ingredients enhance each other's flavours and the science behind their findings.

#### **Taste Tests:**

Organise a taste test where students sample dishes featuring complementary ingredients and discuss how the flavours enhance one another.

#### **Recipe Modification Challenge:**

Provide a basic recipe and ask learners to modify it by adding or substituting complementary ingredients, preparing the modified recipe, and sharing their observations.

#### **Flavour Wheel Creation:**

Learners can create a flavour wheel (use the flavour thesaurus) that includes various ingredients and their complementary pairs, using colours or images to represent different flavour profiles.

{13}------------------------------------------------

#### 2.2.3 Testing sensory qualities

Learners should understand the sensory qualities of food including:

- appearance
- aroma
- flavour
- texture
- viscosity.

Learners should be aware of how to apply sensory descriptors appropriately.

Learners should be aware of how to test sensory qualities such as:

- discrimination tests
- preference tests
- <span id="page-13-0"></span>• star diagrams.

Learners should understand the sensory qualities of food, as these attributes significantly impact their overall experience and appreciation of what people eat. Understanding the **appearance** of food allows learners to assess freshness, ripeness, and presentation, which can influence food choices. Understanding **aroma** helps learners identify flavours and enhances the ability to appreciate and analyse dishes. **Flavour** encompasses the combined impact of taste and smell, which is vital for developing the palate and foster creativity. **Texture** contributes to the mouthfeel of food, affecting satisfaction and enjoyment; it plays a crucial role in determining whether a dish is considered appealing. **Viscosity** influences the perception and enjoyment of sauces, soups, and dressings. By exploring these sensory qualities, learners can make informed choices and transfer gained knowledge into the practical situation.

Use digital technology, via the internet, to research how major food companies and retailers use sensory analysis to help develop new products.

#### **Example activities**

Introduce key sensory attributes by describing various foods such as fruity, smooth, encouraging learners to use the senses.

E.g. compare the appearance of a ripe banana with an unripe banana in terms of colour and texture or the smell of fresh herbs versus dried herbs.

Learners create their own word banks of key words to use in task.

Demonstrate sensory testing methods, for example offer samples of apple juice and see which they prefer.

Activities could be based on group work and conduct tests on samples of snacks looking at chosen attributes and collect data to create star diagrams.

| 2.3.1 Conducting a food investigation | Learners should be aware of food hygiene and safety practices and procedures when conducting a food experiment, including: <ul><li>personal hygiene</li><li>safe working practices</li><li>the safe preparation, cooking, and storage of food. Learners should be able to:</li><li>follow the stages of their food experiment plan</li><li>conduct a food experiment to test a hypothesis based on a research question</li><li>modify variables within a food experiment to achieve different results.</li></ul> | Teachers should discuss with learners the importance of personal hygiene and safe working practices in cooking activities and within the various job roles within the food industry, and all food preparation activities. Key discussion topics include: <ul><li>hand washing</li><li>cleanliness</li><li>danger zone</li><li>key temperature</li><li>cross contamination. Learners should be encouraged to ask questions, make hypotheses and test ideas throughout their food investigation. Learners should be aware of how changes that are made can affect results such as the amount of baking powder in a cake mixture or how the amount of gluten affects bread structure. Learners can choose research questions that interest them, develop a hypothesis and explain how the hypothesis is a testable statement that predicts an outcome, based on a research question. Example activities: Learners should be aware of how changes that are made can affect results such as changing the amount of baking powder in a cake mixture. Link to a food topic such as testing the effects of different storage methods on food quality. Group work could include assigning roles to food safety such as temperature checks.</li></ul> |  |

{15}------------------------------------------------

#### 2.3.2 Collecting, analysing and presenting results

Learners should understand suitable methods used to collect results when testing a hypothesis, such as:

- observations
- measurements
- testing, including sensory quality testing, using sensory descriptors.

Learners should be aware of the importance of validity and reliability when collecting results.

Learners should be able to present results for analysis, using methods such as:

- annotated photographs/illustrations
- bar/pie charts
- star diagrams
- tables.

<span id="page-15-0"></span>Learners should understand how to analyse the results of their food experiment.

Teaching Learners suitable methods for collecting results when testing a hypothesis is essential for developing their scientific skills. Learners should be introduced to the different types of data that they may collect such as [star profiles, preference tests in sensory testing and made aware of the differences between qualitative (descriptive) data and quantitative (numerical) data.

Teachers should explain what observations are and provide relevant food science examples e.g. colour changes, texture in food and viscosity for learners to record observations in detail. Learners should be encouraged to provide specific and measurable observations, not just a description of what they see.

Teachers should encourage learners to present results effectively as this is crucial for analysis. and understanding in any investigation. The importance of clear titles and labelling for charts as well as photographs should be emphasised to learners. Annotated photographs (using arrows and labels to note specific areas) and bar charts etc. are a good way of providing visual representations of results. Learners should choose key photographs that best illustrate important findings such as before and after images of food science experiments.

#### **Example activities:**

- After conducting a sensory test, learners could use software or apps like CANVA and PowerPoint for editing and annotating the images.
- Learners can create bar charts and pie charts comparing the average score of different samples across various attributes.

{16}------------------------------------------------

#### 2.3.3 Reflection and evaluation

Learners should be able to reflect on their food experiment, including:

- drawing conclusions
- <span id="page-16-0"></span>• evaluating results.

Drawing conclusions and evaluating results are critical skills in scientific investigations. It is important to emphasise that conclusions summarise findings and assess whether the hypothesis was correct or incorrect. Evaluating involves critical analysis thinking, data identifying patterns/trends and considers the validity or reliability of the findings.

Teachers should encourage learners to restate their original hypothesis before analysing results, this will help frame the conclusions and evaluation. Learners should support their conclusions with specific evidence from their results. For example, the average spice score for sample 259 was 4, indicating that it was milder than sample 300 which had a score of 8.

Learners should beware of the constraints/limitations of their investigations such as, time, size of sample and human error.

Guide Learners with the reliability of the data: were results consistent?

#### **Example activities:**

Provide opportunities for hands-on experimentation by allowing learners to adjust ingredients or methods and observe how these changes affect recipes. Encourage them to make predictions before testing and discuss outcomes afterwards. Writing about their findings and helping them connect theory to practice. Encourage learners to document their observations during each experiment, noting how changes in time, temperature, and ingredients affect results. Use mind maps or star diagrams to amplify findings.

Encourage learners to reflect on what they have learnt from the process, what surprised them, what skills have they learnt.

Suggest improvements, encourage Learners to think about their investigation if they were to repeat it, what changes would enhance the accuracy or reliability of results.

{17}------------------------------------------------

## <span id="page-17-0"></span>Learning Experiences

Learners should be encouraged to consider the following learning experiences and skills to further develop their understanding, appreciation and awareness of the subject content. Information in the table below provides opportunities for teachers to integrate the learning experiences into delivery.
