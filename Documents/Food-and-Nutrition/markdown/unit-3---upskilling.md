UNIT 3 UPSKILLING RECIPES

HOW TO INCLUDE AS MANY TECHNIQUES AS
POSSIBLE

Techniques
– page 31
Specification

This needs to
be used in
conjunction
with the
marking
scheme from
the SAM

Techniques in individual dishes

The mark scheme in the SAM is very clear that top band marks can only be
awarded when there is evidence of complex techniques across the three
outcomes as well as some medium and basic techniques.

This is for the
cooking
techniques..
You can see that
the MS notes the
need for a
complex cooking
technique in each
of the three dishes
plus at least one
other.

You can
create a
simple
practical
review chart,
combining an
evaluation
and a
personal
performance
review. Your
learners
would
become very
familiar with
the level of
each
technique

MARK SHEET – WJEC website

These are currently being developed and will be available on the open website. The
format will be similar to those for the current legacy specification

Upskilling recipes -  pasta dishes

Many candidates choose a pasta dish. Dried
or ready-made fresh pasta – Never! It’s so
simple to make your own. It can be done in
seconds in a food processor and then use a
pasta rolling machine.  Jars of sauces are
convenient – yes. But no techniques. Try and
add a bread to the menu, especially an
enriched dough, shaped. Think
accompaniments and garnishes. “What
would I get on my plate if I chose this in a
restaurant?” It’s all about “beefing” up the
number of techniques in each complete
dish. Especially complex techniques. Mincing
meat for a pasta dish is a complex knife
technique.

• Try and make the pasta – use
a food processor and pasta
machine for rolling out
• Pasta like Ravioli need
shaping and a filling
prepared.

• Sauce making/blending/knife

skills

• Bread making
• Salad garnish
• Make the Dressing

Upskilling recipes – using chicken

Chicken is the meat of
choice for many candidates.
Not every candidate will
have the ability to fillet a
chicken breast from a whole
chicken. There is an
excellent skills section on
the WJEC website with
videos to help.

Boning a
chicken is a
complex
knife
technique
***

For top band
candidates, consider
filleting/portioning a
chicken

Katsu Chicken curry

Chicken Korma

Chicken kebab

Always try and include a bread

The candidates have 3 hours to complete
the Unit 3 task, more than enough time to
make a bread dish as an accompaniment.
This adds a number of techniques to the
mark sheet.

Homemade
buns for
burgers

Cheesy garlic bread for
any Italian dish

Making flat breads

A bread roll with soup

Three hours is more than
enough time to make
bread, get it proved and
shaped and baked. Cut
down recipes that use 400g
of flour, make half batches.
It will be dovetailed into
their time plan, adding
techniques, and is an
accompaniment for so
many dishes. A simple
burger is upskilled as soon
as a brioche bun is made!
Have you ever seen an
Italian dish without cheesy
garlic bread? Indian food –
make flat bread, and when
do you see soup without
bread?

Think garnishes and accompaniments…

• Coulis
• Fruit or vegetables
• Herbs
• Chocolate work
• Sugar work

Presentation is 6
marks

Curry and rice
not sufficient.
Samosas and
flat bread
added, with 3
chutneys

Presentation is 6 marks. The only thing your moderator will
see is the photos you send along with the mark sheets. So,
make sure that the dishes or plates look their best. It’s
back to beg, steal and borrow. Not all candidates will have
serving dishes or even a table-cloth in some cases. So,
what can school do to help? Put a message on the staff
bulletin. Within days you will be inundated with unwanted
pasta machines and ice cream makers. Tablecloths and
cutlery sets. Can the PTA help?  Just look at these pictures.
Your candidate wants to do curry and rice, so what about
adding samosas and a flat bread with some home-made
chutneys. Look at that pie, would two small pies or two cut
slices not have looked better? With homemade custard of
course.

Smaller portions and individual dishes.
Quicker in preparation and lowering cost.

This Unit can be
expensive, but you need
your learners to show as
many techniques, dishes
and accompaniments as
they can. So, what
about cutting down on
recipe sizes. Avoid full
“family” sized dishes.
Smaller individual
dishes not only look
better, but cost less,
take less time to
prepare and can
sometimes add to the
complexity level.

Get professional help

https://careerswales.gov.wales/

• Local college
• Careers Wales
• Parents
• Local businesses

Get help. Careers Wales has a department that can
find professionals to come into schools or you can
take your learners out to their workplaces. Is there
a local college with a catering department that you
can either visit or arrange for someone to come
out and do a lesson on plating and garnishing?
What about parents? Surely someone is chef who
can spare an hour to do a dem with your Year 10?
Many learners may have a part time job in a local
hospitality business, can that business help? This is
also building links within your wider school
community. Your SMT will love you for that!
