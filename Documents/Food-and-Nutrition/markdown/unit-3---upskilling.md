The mark scheme in the SAM is very clear that top band marks can only be awarded when there is evidence of complex techniques across the three outcomes as well as some medium and basic techniques.

| (d) suitable cooking techniques (see Appendix A) [9 marks |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Band 2                                                    | Award 4-6 marks  Demonstrates the use of at least one complex and at least one other (either basic, medium or complex) cooking technique for two food outcomes.  • mostly accurate use of timing (including contingency plans)  • mostly accurate food hygiene and safety  • mostly accurate use of sequencing. |

This is for the cooking techniques.. You can see that the MS notes the need for a complex cooking technique in each of the three dishes plus at least one other.

Fresh tomato sauce: Slicing \*\* Peeling \* Dicing \*\* Sauteing \*\*

Many candidates choose a pasta dish. Dried or ready-made fresh pasta – Never! It's so simple to make your own. It can be done in seconds in a food processor and then use a pasta rolling machine. Jars of sauces are convenient – yes. But no techniques. Try and add a bread to the menu, especially an enriched dough, shaped. Think accompaniments and garnishes. "What would I get on my plate if I chose this in a restaurant?" It's all about "beefing" up the number of techniques in each complete dish. Especially complex techniques. Mincing meat for a pasta dish is a complex knife technique.

# Upskilling recipes – using chicken

![](_page_8_Picture_2.jpeg)

Chicken is the meat of choice for many candidates. Not every candidate will have the ability to fillet a chicken breast from a whole chicken. There is an excellent skills section on the WJFC website with videos to help.

Boning a chicken is a complexO knife technique \*\*\*

For top band candidates, consider filleting/portioning a chicken

# Always try and include a bread

The candidates have 3 hours to complete the Unit 3 task, more than enough time to make a bread dish as an accompaniment. This adds a number of techniques to the mark sheet.

Making flat breads A bread roll with soup

Three hours is more than enough time to make bread, get it proved and shaped and baked. Cut down recipes that use 400g of flour, make half batches. It will be dovetailed into their time plan, adding techniques, and is an accompaniment for so many dishes. A simple burger is upskilled as soon as a brioche bun is made! Have you ever seen an Italian dish without cheesy garlic bread? Indian food – make flat bread, and when do you see soup without bread?

Presentation is 6 marks

![](_page_10_Picture_14.jpeg)

Presentation is 6 marks. The only thing your moderator will see is the photos you send along with the mark sheets. So, make sure that the dishes or plates look their best. It's back to beg, steal and borrow. Not all candidates will have serving dishes or even a table-cloth in some cases. So, what can school do to help? Put a message on the staff bulletin. Within days you will be inundated with unwanted pasta machines and ice cream makers. Tablecloths and cutlery sets. Can the PTA help? Just look at these pictures. Your candidate wants to do curry and rice, so what about adding samosas and a flat bread with some home-made chutneys. Look at that pie, would two small pies or two cut slices not have looked better? With homemade custard of course.

## Smaller portions and individual dishes. Quicker in preparation and lowering cost.

![](_page_11_Picture_2.jpeg)

This Unit can be expensive, but you need your learners to show as many techniques, dishes and accompaniments as they can. So, what about cutting down on recipe sizes. Avoid full "family" sized dishes. Smaller individual dishes not only look better, but cost less, take less time to prepare and can sometimes add to the complexity level.

## • Local college

- Careers Wales
- Parents
- Local businesses

Get help. Careers Wales has a department that can find professionals to come into schools or you can take your learners out to their workplaces. Is there a local college with a catering department that you can either visit or arrange for someone to come out and do a lesson on plating and garnishing? What about parents? Surely someone is chef who can spare an hour to do a dem with your Year 10? Many learners may have a part time job in a local hospitality business, can that business help? This is also building links within your wider school community. Your SMT will love you for that!
