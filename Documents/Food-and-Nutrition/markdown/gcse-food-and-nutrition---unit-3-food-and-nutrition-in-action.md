- an observation record sheet for use with task 3
- a mark record sheet
- a **candidate pack** which includes:
  - details of the assignment
  - a detailed breakdown of each task
  - information for candidates, which tells candidates about things that they must and must not do when they are completing the assessment
  - the mark scheme which must be used to assess candidate work
  - a Candidate Declaration Form

**You must provide each candidate with a copy of the complete candidate assessment pack.**

# <span id="page-3-1"></span>Managing the assessment

This is a centre-marked (internal) non-examination assessment. The following arrangements must be followed when managing and marking the assessment.

#### **Time**

Candidates must be allowed 12 **hours** to complete this assessment. Candidates should spend approximately:

- 3 hours completing Task 1
- 4 hours completing Task 2
- 3 hours completing Task 3
- 2 hours completing Task 4.

The time suggested for each task takes account of the contribution of the task to the overall assessment requirements. There can be no changes to the total time available for this assessment. Centres can, however, amend the suggested time available for each task.

#### **Resources**

Candidates must have access to the candidate assessment pack and any necessary resources, as specified in the detailed task tables within the candidate pack.

#### **Collaboration**

Group work is **not** allowed. Candidates must complete all tasks individually.

{4}------------------------------------------------

#### **Supervision**

Candidates must be supervised by an assessor whilst completing the activities. Centres must have in place systems to ensure candidates cannot access evidence they have been developing outside of supervised activities.

#### **Authentication**

Supervision must be in place to ensure the authenticity of evidence produced for summative assessment.

You should not provide input or guidance to candidates during the assessment time. This includes providing formative feedback on the evidence being produced. You can provide guidance on the requirements of the task and remind candidates of the mark bands and how they can be interpreted.

Candidates can review and redraft evidence independently within the time controls for the assessment.

Candidates must sign the declaration to confirm that all evidence submitted for moderation is their own work and that any sources used have been acknowledged.

Assessors must sign the declaration to confirm that evidence submitted for moderation was completed under the controlled conditions set out in this assessment.

#### **Candidate evidence**

The acceptable formats for evidence of each of the tasks is summarised in the task tables. Any modified assessment must enable the candidate to generate the evidence required in this table.

#### **Marking the assessment**

The marking scheme for this assessment are included in the candidate pack.

All marking of evidence must be made against the marking scheme provided. Evidence marked must comply with any requirements set out in the assessment pack.

Written evidence must be annotated to show how it relates to the mark band requirements.

Marking should only be undertaken by a designated assessor. An assessor should have appropriate expertise in the subject and level for a specified unit. The assessor is responsible for ensuring that:

- assessment is conducted under the controls specified in the task table
- they are clear about the requirements of the assessment and marking scheme prior to commencing assessment
- evidence presented for assessment is valid, authentic; reliable and credible
- assessment decisions are accurately recorded
- evidence is appropriately annotated
- observation records contain sufficient detail for objective corroboration of decisions
- judgements are only made against the mark band statements.

A mark record sheet must be completed for each candidate.

{5}------------------------------------------------

#### **Further information**

You should refer the JCQ Instructions for conducting non-examination assessment for further information on managing assessment within our GCSE Qualifications.

**This pack is a sample. It must not be used for live assessment.**

# Information for candidates

The following information has been taken from the [JCQ Information for candidates](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) – non[examination assessments](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) and the [JCQ Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) Use in Assessments:](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/)  [Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/) This tells you about things that you **must** and **must not** do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not understand, you **must** ask your teacher.

#### **Preparing your work**

- When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you need to ensure that your final product reflects your own independent work and isn't copied or paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
- If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you **must** tell your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
- If you worked as part of a group on a task, you **must** each write up your own account of the assignment. Even if the data you have is the same, you **must** describe in your own words how that data was obtained, and you **must** independently draw your own conclusions from the data.
- Take care of your work and keep it safe. **Do not** leave it lying around where your classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You **must** always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; **do not** share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
- **Do not** be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI tools and chatbots) – this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort of copying.
- You **must not** write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

#### **Plagiarism**

Plagiarism involves taking someone else's words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them off as your own. **It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously.** Don't think you won't be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:

- Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
- Markers are highly experienced subject specialists they may have read the source you are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!
- Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and style of writing or punctuation.

#### **Penalties for breaking the regulations**

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be applied:

- the piece of work will be awarded zero marks
- you will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question
- you will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series
- you will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

**Remember – it's your qualification so it needs to be your own work.**

{18}------------------------------------------------

# Mark scheme

The following mark scheme will be used to assess your work.

**0 marks will be awarded if there is no evidence or submitted work is not worthy of credit.**

#### **Task 1**

Research and investigate the chosen brief (to include trialing and testing).

Research should link to the chosen brief and include reference to at least **three** of the **factors that influence food and ingredient choice.** This may include one or more of the following:

- cultural influences
- food availability and seasonality
- levels of physical activity
- lifestyles
- nutritional needs across the life stages
- personal preferences
- religious beliefs
- sensory qualities
- shelf life of food
- socio-economic influences
- specific dietary needs or nutritional deficiencies
- current emerging trends related to factors that affect food and ingredient choice
- the benefits of using locally sourced, Welsh food.
