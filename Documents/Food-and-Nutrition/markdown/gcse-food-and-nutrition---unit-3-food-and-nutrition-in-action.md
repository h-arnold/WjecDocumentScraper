About this pack: information for teachers

This pack contains the assessment materials for Unit 3: Food and Nutrition in Action.

information for teachers on how to manage arrangements for assessment

Within this pack, you will find:
•
•  an observation record sheet for use with task 3
•  a mark record sheet
•  a candidate pack which includes:

•  details of the assignment
•  a detailed breakdown of each task
•

•
•  a Candidate Declaration Form
•  a Candidate Time Record sheet.

information for candidates, which tells candidates about things that they must and
must not do when they are completing the assessment
the mark scheme which must be used to assess candidate work

You must provide each candidate with a copy of the complete candidate assessment
pack.

Managing the assessment

This is a centre-marked (internal) non-examination assessment. The following arrangements
must be followed when managing and marking the assessment.

Time

Candidates must be allowed 12 hours to complete this assessment. Candidates should
spend approximately:

•  3 hours completing Task 1
•  4 hours completing Task 2
•  3 hours completing Task 3
•  2 hours completing Task 4.

The time suggested for each task takes account of the contribution of the task to the overall
assessment requirements. There can be no changes to the total time available for this
assessment. Centres can, however, amend the suggested time available for each task.

Resources

Candidates must have access to the candidate assessment pack and any necessary
resources, as specified in the detailed task tables within the candidate pack.

Collaboration

Group work is not allowed. Candidates must complete all tasks individually.

Supervision

Candidates must be supervised by an assessor whilst completing the activities. Centres
must have in place systems to ensure candidates cannot access evidence they have been
developing outside of supervised activities.

Authentication

Supervision must be in place to ensure the authenticity of evidence produced for summative
assessment.

You should not provide input or guidance to candidates during the assessment time. This
includes providing formative feedback on the evidence being produced. You can provide
guidance on the requirements of the task and remind candidates of the mark bands and how
they can be interpreted.

Candidates can review and redraft evidence independently within the time controls for the
assessment.

Candidates must sign the declaration to confirm that all evidence submitted for moderation is
their own work and that any sources used have been acknowledged.

Assessors must sign the declaration to confirm that evidence submitted for moderation was
completed under the controlled conditions set out in this assessment.

Candidate evidence

The acceptable formats for evidence of each of the tasks is summarised in the task tables.
Any modified assessment must enable the candidate to generate the evidence required in
this table.

Marking the assessment

The marking scheme for this assessment are included in the candidate pack.

All marking of evidence must be made against the marking scheme provided. Evidence
marked must comply with any requirements set out in the assessment pack.

Written evidence must be annotated to show how it relates to the mark band requirements.

Marking should only be undertaken by a designated assessor. An assessor should have
appropriate expertise in the subject and level for a specified unit. The assessor is
responsible for ensuring that:
•  assessment is conducted under the controls specified in the task table
•

they are clear about the requirements of the assessment and marking scheme prior to
commencing assessment

•  evidence presented for assessment is valid, authentic; reliable and credible
•  assessment decisions are accurately recorded
•  evidence is appropriately annotated
•  observation records contain sufficient detail for objective corroboration of decisions
•

judgements are only made against the mark band statements.

A mark record sheet must be completed for each candidate.

Information for candidates

The following information has been taken from the JCQ Information for candidates – non-
examination assessments and the JCQ Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use in Assessments:
Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications. This tells you about things that you must and must
not do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not
understand, you must ask your teacher.

Preparing your work

•  When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you need to

•

•

ensure that your final product reflects your own independent work and isn’t copied or
paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you must tell
your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
If you worked as part of a group on a task, you must each write up your own account of
the assignment. Even if the data you have is the same, you must describe in your own
words how that data was obtained, and you must independently draw your own
conclusions from the data.

•  Take care of your work and keep it safe. Do not leave it lying around where your

classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You
must always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; do not
share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your
password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
•  Do not be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI

tools and chatbots) – this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort
of copying.

•  You must not write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

Plagiarism

Plagiarism involves taking someone else’s words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them
off as your own. It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously. Don’t think you
won’t be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:
•  Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
•  Markers are highly experienced subject specialists – they may have read the source you

•

are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!
Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match
phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and
style of writing or punctuation.

Penalties for breaking the regulations

the piece of work will be awarded zero marks

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be
applied:
•
•  you will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question
•  you will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series
•  you will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of

time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

Remember – it’s your qualification so it needs to be your own work.
