# GCSE FOOD AND NUTRITION

# <span id="page-7-0"></span>1 INTRODUCTION

# <span id="page-7-1"></span>1.1 Aims

The GCSE Food and Nutrition qualification must support learners to:

- understand the journey of food from 'field to fork'
- make healthy and informed food choices for themselves and others
- explain the function, nutritional benefits and sensory qualities of ingredients within a recipe
- explain the function and nutritional benefits of food and drinks in the human body
- describe the links between diet, nutrition, health and well-being
- explore the economic, environmental, ethical, and socio-cultural influences on food availability, production processes, diet, and health choices
- effectively and safely prepare, process, store, cook and serve food which contains a variety of food commodities
- explore a range of ingredients, and cooking methods and techniques, from local, national, and international cuisines
- modify existing recipes and develop their own ideas for dishes
- explore the cross-cutting curriculum theme of human rights and diversity including the contributions and cuisines of Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities and individuals
- gain an appreciation of how food connects us to the world around us
- analyse and evaluate a range of food and dishes made by themselves and others.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales' Approval Criteria.

# <span id="page-7-2"></span>1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Food and Nutrition qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/statements-of-what-matters/)  [what matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/statements-of-what-matters/) and those [subject specific skills and concepts](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area) outlined in the ['Designing](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/designing-your-curriculum/)  [your Curriculum'](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/health-and-well-being/designing-your-curriculum/) section of the Health and Well-being Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix B provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted on page 25. The Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery. 

{8}------------------------------------------------

The GCSE Food and Nutrition qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:

- supporting the statements of what matters[1](#page-8-0) by giving learners the opportunity to:
  - understand the factors that affect physical health and well-being that promote healthy bodies and healthy minds. This includes health-promoting behaviours such as following a balanced diet
  - develop the confidence, motivation, physical competence, knowledge and understanding that can help them lead healthy and active lifestyles which promote good physical health and well-being by studying nutrition and good health
  - enable learners to develop the critical-thinking skills necessary to consider their decision-making in terms of possible implications when preparing food, including risks, for themselves and others
  - engage critically with these social influences within their own culture that influence diet and health choices.
- supporting the principles of progression[2](#page-8-1) by encouraging learners to:
  - deepen learning in a wide range of concepts within the statements of what matters across a wide range of topics and aspects of food and nutrition
  - develop their independence and agency in matters relating to nutrition and good health: resulting in a growing responsibility for their own health and wellbeing
  - putting what they have learned about food and nutrition into a practical context, developing conceptual knowledge
  - develop practical skills such as food preparation and cooking that also supports learners in their health and well-being.
- supporting the subject specific considerations for Food and Nutrition[3](#page-8-2) . The qualification will:
  - provide opportunities for learners to understand the journey from 'field to fork', explore the economic, ethical and environmental influences of food availability and consider sustainability, production and processing of food
  - provide opportunities for learners to make healthy and informed food choices for themselves and others, make links between diet, nutrition, health and wellbeing, explore the influences of diet and health choices and explore the function and nutritional benefits of food and drinks on the human body
  - provide opportunities for learners to develop an understanding of the functional properties of food within the body and the ingredients used within a recipe
  - equip learners with the skills to effectively and safely prepare, process, store, cook and serve food, modify existing recipes and develop their own dishes, analyse and evaluate a range of food and dishes made by themselves and others, and explore the sensory qualities of ingredients within a recipe
  - provide opportunities for learners to appreciate how food connects us to the world around us, explore the contributions and cuisines of Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities and individuals, and explore a range of ingredients, cooking methods and techniques from local, national, and international cuisines, and socio-cultural influences on food availability.

{9}------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="page-9-0"></span>1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of Level 3 Certificate in Food Science and Nutrition. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

#### <span id="page-9-1"></span>1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE Food and Nutrition has been designed to be delivered within 120 – 140 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

#### <span id="page-9-2"></span>1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

#### <span id="page-9-3"></span>1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website [\(www.jcq.org.uk\).](http://www.jcq.org.uk/)

{10}------------------------------------------------

### *GCSE FOOD AND NUTRITION 10*

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

{11}------------------------------------------------

# <span id="page-11-0"></span>2 SUBJECT CONTENT

# <span id="page-11-1"></span>How to read the amplification

The amplification provided in the right-hand column uses the following four stems:

- 'Learners should be aware of' is used when learners need a basic knowledge of the specified content, and this does not need to be taught in detail. Teachers should refer to Guidance for Teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and breadth to which this content should be taught.
- 'Learners should know' is used when learners are required to demonstrate basic knowledge and understanding.
- 'Learners should understand' is used when learners are required to demonstrate greater depth of knowledge and understanding, application of knowledge to contexts, and evaluation and analysis of information.
- 'Learners should be able to' is used when learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills techniques.

The use of the word 'including' indicates that the specified content must be taught and could be subject to assessment.

The use of the words 'for example' or 'such as' indicates that the specified content is for guidance only, and alternative examples could be chosen.

{28}------------------------------------------------

# <span id="page-28-0"></span>3.2 Overview of arrangements for non-examination assessment

## Unit 2

For this assessment, learners are required to complete a food investigation where they apply knowledge and understanding of the working characteristics, functions and chemical properties of ingredients in a recipe.

Learners are provided with a pre-released brief that will be available to centres during May of the first year of study (Year 10). Centres choose one of two briefs they would like learners to study.

For Task 1, based on the chosen brief, learners or teachers cook a control food item outcome, using a recipe, in order to develop a baseline. Research is conducted into the working characteristics, functions and chemical properties of ingredients in the recipe and a hypothesis is developed. The remaining tasks are centred around proving or disproving the hypothesis.

This non-examination assessment contributes to 20% of the overall qualification grade and will take 8 hours to complete. The assignment could be completed in several sittings due to the length of the non-examination assessment. The assignment will be marked out of a total of 40 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be marked by the centre and moderated by WJEC.

## Unit 3

For this assessment, learners are required to plan, prepare and cook a food outcome.

Learners are provided with a pre-released brief that will be available to centres during May of the first year of study (Year 10). Learners choose one of two briefs they would like to complete for the non-examination assessment.

For Task 1, learners research and investigate the chosen task, choosing a recipe based on the brief. The rest of the assessment is based around planning, preparing and cooking the food outcome to meet the brief.

This assessment contributes to 40% of the overall qualification grade and will take 12 hours to complete. The assignment could be completed in several sittings due to the length of the non-examination assessment. The assignment will be marked out of a total of 80 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be marked by the centre and moderated by WJEC.

{29}------------------------------------------------

# <span id="page-29-0"></span>4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for GCSE Food and Nutrition.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our [Guide to preventing, reporting and](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)  [investigating malpractice.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC (malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet [Suspected](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)  [Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)

# <span id="page-30-0"></span>5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

# <span id="page-30-1"></span>5.1 Making entries

This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the course. Non-examination assessment units can be completed earlier in the course but must be submitted at the end of the course.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series for the lifetime of this specification. Summer 2027 will be the first assessment opportunity.

A qualification may be taken more than once. Candidates must resit all examination units in the same series.

Marks for non-examination assessment (NEA) may be carried forward for the life of the specification. If a candidate resits an NEA unit (rather than carrying forward the previous NEA mark), it is the new mark that will count towards the overall grade, even if it is lower than a previous attempt (unless the mark is absent).

The entry code appears below.
