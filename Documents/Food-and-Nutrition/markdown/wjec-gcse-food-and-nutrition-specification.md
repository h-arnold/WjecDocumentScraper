INTRODUCTION

1.1  Aims

understand the journey of food – from ‘field to fork’

The GCSE Food and Nutrition qualification must support learners to:
•
• make healthy and informed food choices for themselves and others
•

explain the function, nutritional benefits and sensory qualities of ingredients within
a recipe
explain the function and nutritional benefits of food and drinks in the human body
describe the links between diet, nutrition, health and well-being
explore the economic, environmental, ethical, and socio-cultural influences on
food availability, production processes, diet, and health choices
effectively and safely prepare, process, store, cook and serve food which
contains a variety of food commodities
explore a range of ingredients, and cooking methods and techniques, from local,
national, and international cuisines

•
•
•

•

•

• modify existing recipes and develop their own ideas for dishes
•

explore the cross-cutting curriculum theme of human rights and diversity including
the contributions and cuisines of Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities
and individuals
gain an appreciation of how food connects us to the world around us
analyse and evaluate a range of food and dishes made by themselves and
others.

•
•

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales’ Approval Criteria.

1.2  Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Food and Nutrition qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for
Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to
make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification.
Central to this design are the principles of progression, along with the statements of
what matters and those subject specific skills and concepts outlined in the ‘Designing
your Curriculum’ section of the Health and Well-being Area of Learning and
Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to
embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral
skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix B provides a simple
mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for
Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for
integrating the learning experiences noted on page 25. The Guidance for Teaching
will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

GCSE FOOD AND NUTRITION 8

•

The GCSE Food and Nutrition qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:
•

supporting the statements of what matters1 by giving learners the opportunity to:
understand the factors that affect physical health and well-being that promote
•
healthy bodies and healthy minds. This includes health-promoting behaviours
such as following a balanced diet
develop the confidence, motivation, physical competence, knowledge and
understanding that can help them lead healthy and active lifestyles which
promote good physical health and well-being by studying nutrition and good
health
enable learners to develop the critical-thinking skills necessary to consider
their decision-making in terms of possible implications when preparing food,
including risks, for themselves and others
engage critically with these social influences within their own culture that
influence diet and health choices.

•

•

•

•

supporting the principles of progression2 by encouraging learners to:
•

deepen learning in a wide range of concepts within the statements of what
matters across a wide range of topics and aspects of food and nutrition
develop their independence and agency in matters relating to nutrition and
good health: resulting in a growing responsibility for their own health and well-
being
putting what they have learned about food and nutrition into a practical
context, developing conceptual knowledge
develop practical skills such as food preparation and cooking that also
supports learners in their health and well-being.

•

•

•

supporting the subject specific considerations for Food and Nutrition3. The
qualification will:
•

provide opportunities for learners to understand the journey from ‘field to fork’,
explore the economic, ethical and environmental influences of food availability
and consider sustainability, production and processing of food
provide opportunities for learners to make healthy and informed food choices
for themselves and others, make links between diet, nutrition, health and well-
being, explore the influences of diet and health choices and explore the
function and nutritional benefits of food and drinks on the human body
provide opportunities for learners to develop an understanding of the
functional properties of food within the body and the ingredients used within a
recipe
equip learners with the skills to effectively and safely prepare, process, store,
cook and serve food, modify existing recipes and develop their own dishes,
analyse and evaluate a range of food and dishes made by themselves and
others, and explore the sensory qualities of ingredients within a recipe
provide opportunities for learners to appreciate how food connects us to the
world around us, explore the contributions and cuisines of Black, Asian and
minority ethnic communities and individuals, and explore a range of
ingredients, cooking methods and techniques from local, national, and
international cuisines, and socio-cultural influences on food availability.

1.3

Prior learning and progression

GCSE FOOD AND NUTRITION 9

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is
designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the
conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages
3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills
and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares
learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation
for the study of Level 3 Certificate in Food Science and Nutrition. In addition, the
specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for
learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

1.4

Guided learning hours

GCSE  Food  and  Nutrition  has  been  designed  to  be  delivered  within  120  –  140
guided  learning  hours.  The  qualification  has  been  primarily  designed  as  a  2-year
programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

1.5

Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our
language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters
respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying
informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity.
Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further
amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC
will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the
specification will always be on the website.

1.6

Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic,
religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible,
features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access
and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual
orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to
enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills
without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the
following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access
Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications.
This document is available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk).

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2024

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of
provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete
barrier to any part of the assessment.

3.2  Overview of arrangements for non-examination assessment

GCSE FOOD AND NUTRITION 28

Unit 2

For this assessment, learners are required to complete a food investigation where
they apply knowledge and understanding of the working characteristics, functions
and chemical properties of ingredients in a recipe.

Learners are provided with a pre-released brief that will be available to centres during
May of the first year of study (Year 10). Centres choose one of two briefs they would
like learners to study.

For Task 1, based on the chosen brief, learners or teachers cook a control food item
outcome, using a recipe, in order to develop a baseline. Research is conducted into
the working characteristics, functions and chemical properties of ingredients in the
recipe and a hypothesis is developed. The remaining tasks are centred around
proving or disproving the hypothesis.

This non-examination assessment contributes to 20% of the overall qualification
grade and will take 8 hours to complete. The assignment could be completed in
several sittings due to the length of the non-examination assessment. The
assignment will be marked out of a total of 40 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be marked
by the centre and moderated by WJEC.

Unit 3

For this assessment, learners are required to plan, prepare and cook a food
outcome.

Learners are provided with a pre-released brief that will be available to centres during
May of the first year of study (Year 10). Learners choose one of two briefs they would
like to complete for the non-examination assessment.

For Task 1, learners research and investigate the chosen task, choosing a recipe
based on the brief. The rest of the assessment is based around planning, preparing
and cooking the food outcome to meet the brief.

This assessment contributes to 40% of the overall qualification grade and will take 12
hours to complete. The assignment could be completed in several sittings due to the
length of the non-examination assessment. The assignment will be marked out of a
total of 80 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be marked
by the centre and moderated by WJEC.

regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in
the preparation of work for GCSE Food and Nutrition.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our Guide to preventing, reporting and
investigating malpractice.

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC
(malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or
disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet Suspected
Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

5.1  Making entries

GCSE FOOD AND NUTRITION 30

This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the
course. Non-examination assessment units can be completed earlier in the course
but must be submitted at the end of the course.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series for the lifetime of
this specification. Summer 2027 will be the first assessment opportunity.

A qualification may be taken more than once. Candidates must resit all examination
units in the same series.

Marks for non-examination assessment (NEA) may be carried forward for the life of
the specification. If a candidate resits an NEA unit (rather than carrying forward the
previous NEA mark), it is the new mark that will count towards the overall grade,
even if it is lower than a previous attempt (unless the mark is absent).

The entry code appears below.
