Unit 1 Teacher Guidance

1.1 Food commodity groups

Content Amplification

Teacher Guidance

1.1.1 Food
commodity
groups

Learners should know examples from the
food commodity groups, including:
•  carbohydrate foods, including fibre,

starch and sugar

•  dairy foods and alternatives
•
•
•  protein foods including eggs, fish,

fats and oils
fruits and vegetables

meat and plant-based alternatives.

Learners should understand the:
•  nutritional value of the food

•

commodity groups
functions and characteristics of the
food commodity groups.

Learners should be aware of:
•  storage options relating to the food

•

commodity groups
the origins of the food commodity
groups.

Teachers should ensure that natural links to other areas of the specification are
considered when planning and delivering lessons based on commodities. Practical
activities offer invaluable opportunities to highlight and reinforce information linked to
the ingredients used and how they react during cooking.

Commodities can be studied individually or grouped together.

Key points to consider for each commodity include:
•  classification and characteristics
•  nutritional value and contribution to a healthy diet
•  provenance
•  purchase and storage.

Example Task – Combination
Plant based diets are becoming increasingly popular in the UK. Investigate a range of
commodities included in this type of diet with the focus being their functions and
characteristics, nutritional value and their contribution to a healthy plant-based diet.

Teachers can select the number of commodities to focus on when planning this task. It
naturally gravitates towards fruits, vegetables and plant-based alternatives to protein
foods, but as plant-based diets are not vegan diets, teachers could choose to include
some animal products.

If resources allow, experimental work/tasting and testing could be carried out e.g. milk
alternatives used in sauces. Learners will transfer these skills to Units 2 and 3.

Product websites can be used to gather information and customer reviews offer other
people's opinions.

GCSE Food and Nutrition Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 6

Example Task – Individual
Fats and oils have a wide range of functions in food preparation. Research a range of
fats and oils with the focus being their properties and characteristics, functions in food
preparation, nutritional value and their contribution to a healthy diet.

Resources will dictate the approach to this task. It can be a theory exercise with
reinforcement where appropriate during practical lessons or, if resources allow, a
range of fats and oils can be provided so that learners can read labels and examine
the characteristics to gather information. If possible, learners could carry out some
experimental work e.g. shortening in pastry and/or sensory analysis in preparation for
Units 2 and 3.

Product websites can be used to gather information and customer reviews offer other
people's opinions.

GCSE Food and Nutrition Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 7

1.2 Nutrients for a balanced diet

1.2.1
Macronutrients

Content Amplification

Learners should know the role of
macronutrients, including:
•  carbohydrates
•
fat
•  protein.

Learners should understand, for each
macronutrient:
functions
•
•  sources
•  effects of deficiency or excess.

Teacher Guidance

As nutrition underpins this qualification, it is important that teachers ensure that
learners are confident discussing the function and sources of proteins, fats and
carbohydrates as well as the effects of excess or deficiency of each of these
macronutrients.

Macronutrients provide the body with energy and learners should know the type of
energy they supply together with at least two/three food sources, and both plant and
animal sources in the case of protein and fats.

•  Protein – high biological value and low biological value
•  Fat – saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated
•  Carbohydrates – sugar, starch and dietary fibre.

Application of knowledge is key, and learners should be encouraged to extend their
sentences using ‘Nutrient – Function – Source’ when writing about nutrition
throughout the units. For example, ‘Protein is required for growth and repair and can
be found in eggs and soya beans.’

Progression will see learners qualifying the type of macronutrient e.g. HBV or LBV
protein and commenting on the effects of excess or deficiency.

Using this technique helps when completing higher tariff questions in Unit 1, analysis
of experimental results in Unit 2 and the justification of chosen dishes in Unit 3.

WJEC GCSE textbooks and online resources provide an accurate guide to the level of
nutrition required for this qualification. Blended learning resources and knowledge
organisers have been developed for each section of Unit 1. These can be adapted to
suit your cohort and cynefin. The current GCSE textbooks can continue to be used as
there is very little change to specification content.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

GCSE Food and Nutrition Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 8

Example Task – Designed as a building block for a broader task involving both
macronutrients and micronutrients.

The body requires energy in order to function. Discuss the three macronutrients and
their importance in the diet.

Teachers are looking for information on proteins, fats and carbohydrates written in
extended sentences. Knowledge of the macronutrient could include subcategories,
functions, sources and the effects of excess or deficiency. A structure strip could be
produced to guide learners, maintain focus and improve the overall quality of written
work. Remind learners to apply existing literacy skills when completing the task.

1.2.2
Micronutrients

Learners should know the role of
micronutrients, including:
•  minerals: calcium, iron, potassium

A similar approach can be taken when teaching the micronutrients as the
macronutrients and questioning during practical sessions will allow recall linked to
individual ingredients and their nutritional value.

and magnesium

•  vitamins: fat soluble vitamins A, D, E
and K. Water soluble vitamins B1,
B2, B3, B12, B9 and C.

Learners should understand, for each
micronutrient:
•
functions
•  sources
•  effects of deficiency or excess.

Food commodities and nutrition have clear links and should always be discussed
together. As with macro-nutrients, ‘Nutrient – Function – Source’ and structure
strips are excellent tools to use in order to develop knowledge and understanding,
providing learners with easy-to-use resources which they can use across all units.
Effects of excess and deficiencies can be included using a similar approach.

WJEC GCSE textbooks and online resources can be used to identify the level of
knowledge required. Blended learning resources and knowledge organisers have
been developed for each section of Unit 1. These can be adapted to suit your cohort
and cynefin. The current GCSE textbooks can continue to be used as there is very
little change to specification content.

•  Learners must concentrate on good sources of each of the listed vitamins and
minerals and be able to recall at least two/three good sources, and where
appropriate, include both plant and animal sources.

•  The main functions of each of the micronutrients listed should be clearly

identified.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

GCSE Food and Nutrition Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 9

•  Teachers should emphasise the differences between fat and water soluble
vitamins and learners need to know that vitamins can also be categorised as
antioxidants.

•  The complementary action between micronutrients e.g. iron and vitamin C

should be highlighted.

Example Task – Designed as a building block for a broader task involving both
the macronutrients and micronutrients.
Individually or in pairs, produce an interactive learning resource to help the delivery of
the topic ‘Vitamins and minerals’.

Learners can produce any form of resource to help the delivery of the topic. This
allows all types of learners to play to their strengths and gain confidence from peers if
they choose to work in a pair. The opportunity to use each other’s resources will help
learners to retain the information.

Teachers could use the definition of a ‘balanced’ diet as a starting point for this area
and initiate a discussion linked to a ‘healthy’ balanced diet. If learners understand that
both these elements are important then it provides more scope for application of their
knowledge of macronutrients and micronutrients, their complementary action, energy
intake and the importance of physical activity.

Learners should understand:
•

the importance of fibre and water in a
balanced diet
the complementary actions of
nutrients.

•

Learners should know how to calculate
energy and nutritional values in food.

•

It is the teacher’s responsibility to keep up to date with current recommended
guidelines for a healthy diet and strategies in place for Wales.

Learners should be aware of:
•  The Eatwell Guide and its

•

recommendations to achieve a
balanced diet
the importance of determining energy
requirements based on levels of
physical activity.

•  Using ‘The Eatwell Guide’ and its recommendations will help demonstrate how to
achieve a balanced diet at the same time as providing opportunities to discuss the
importance of water and dietary fibre.

•  Quick tasks such as measuring glasses of water and watching a wholegrain
breakfast cereal absorb liquid helps to cement abstract concepts and learner
understanding.
Interpretation of food labelling and the traffic light system on packaging should be
referred to. A collection of food labels is an invaluable resource to have in the
classroom.

•

1.2.3 A
balanced diet

GCSE Food and Nutrition Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 10

•  There are various nutritional analysis programs available to schools e.g. Food a
fact of life. Teachers are free to use the one they feel most comfortable with and
have the resources in their centre available to run them.
If skill based practical sessions are delivered alongside this topic, there will be
natural opportunities to discuss the recipes made as part of healthy, balanced
diets. Learners should be able to suggest adaptions that could be made to existing
recipes based on knowledge gained.

•

Example Task – Dietary Nutritional Analysis
a)  Keep a food diary for one day. Remember to record all your meals, snacks and

drinks in as much detail as possible e.g. 2 Weetabix with semi-skimmed milk and a
teaspoon of sugar, 1 piece of wholemeal toast with butter and strawberry jam and
a glass of sugar free orange squash.

b)  Use a nutritional analysis program to calculate the energy and nutritional value of

your diet.

c)  Comment on the data produced identifying changes that might be made in order to

improve your diet.

d)  Justify the changes you have suggested to your diet.

Teachers can adapt this task to suit their class. It can be extended by recording
additional days or comparing a school day with a weekend day. It can be condensed
by providing the learners with an example of a diet and missing out part ‘a)’, or by
selecting the number of nutrients you wish the learners to comment on. Part ‘d)’ could
be included or removed depending on learner ability or time available. Nutritional
analysis will also be required when completing Unit 3 and ‘Nutrient – Function –
Source’ is a good way to access higher mark bands when assessing the quality of
work.

Example Task – Recipe Nutritional Analysis
a)  Select a recipe that you have used in one of your practical sessions.
b)  Use a nutritional analysis program to calculate the energy and nutritional value of
your recipe. Remember to analyse one portion of the recipe if it serves more than
one person.

c)  Comment on the data produced, identifying changes that might be made in order

to improve the nutritional content of the recipe.

d)  Justify the changes you have suggested.

Teachers can adapt this task to suit their class. It can be extended by adding the
accompaniments you would serve as part of a meal. It can be condensed by providing
the learners with a recipe and missing out part ‘a)’, or by selecting the number of
nutrients you wish the learners to comment on. Part ‘d)’ could be included or removed
depending on learner ability or time available. Nutritional analysis will also be required
when completing Unit 3 and ‘Nutrient – Function – Source’ is a good way to access
higher mark bands when assessing the quality of work.

1.3 Diet and health

1.3.1 How
nutritional
needs change
over the life
stages

Content Amplification

Learners should understand how
nutritional needs change over the life
stages, including:
•
infancy
•  childhood
•  adolescence
•  adulthood
•

later adulthood.

Learners should be aware of the daily
recommended intake of nutrients over
the life stages.

Teacher Guidance

This module builds on the knowledge and understanding gained from previous
lessons focusing on nutrients for a balanced diet, and recommended guidelines for a
healthy diet. Learners require an understanding of the nutritional needs of the listed
groups and should be able to suggest improvements to diets with clear justification for
changes made. Case studies provide the opportunity for learners to demonstrate and
apply their knowledge and understanding as well as analysing and evaluating different
aspects of food and nutrition.

Example Task
Morgan is a Year 13 student who has just obtained a sport scholarship with Triathlon
Cymru. They train at least 9 sessions a week to include swimming, cycling, running,
strength and conditioning. Morgan has limited spare time and their diet varies. An
example of a day’s meals can be seen below:

4.  Suggest improvements Morgan could make to their diet and give reasons for the

changes.

Example Task
David is 85 years old and until recently he has lived at home. Arthritic knee joints
meant that walking became very painful which limited his mobility and his ability to
prepare and cook meals for himself. After a series of hospital admissions, as a result
of falls, it was decided that he should move into a nursing home. The menu changes
monthly and an example of one day in October can be seen below

4.  Suggest improvements the nursing home could make to their menu and give

reasons for the changes.

5.  Plan, prepare and cook one of your suggested recipes included in the adapted

menu.

Teachers could adapt scenarios to fit any life stage, differentiate the tasks to suit the
ability of the learners, build in progression and where appropriate, plan and carry out
practical work. These skills will be transferred when completing the Unit 3 NEA.

GCSE Food and Nutrition Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 15

This module can be delivered in isolation; however, there are opportunities to include
all the conditions listed when planning tasks linked to nutrition, healthy and balanced
diets and feeding different target groups. Case studies similar to the example task in
1.3.1 can be easily written to include any of the specific dietary needs. Practical and
experimental work could also be designed to include adaptations to existing recipes in
order to meet the necessary requirements. It is important to focus on the nutritional
needs of the condition and how to plan healthy and balanced diets to meet these
specific needs.

Example Task
Many people are diagnosed with conditions which require adaptions to their diet.
These include:
•  anaemia
•  cardiovascular disease
•  coeliac disease
•
•
•

food intolerances
food allergies
type 2 diabetes.

Produce an interesting PowerPoint presentation that could be used at a drop-in
session in your local health centre. Include basic information linked to each condition
(it could be one or more) highlighting any specific nutritional needs. Include suitable
suggestions for adapting and planning diets to meet the identified requirements.

Teachers could reduce the time required to complete tasks such as these by
designing them as group tasks with one condition allocated to each group. The
information is then shared during the presentation of the work. ‘Learners leading
learning’ requires careful planning and differentiation so learners of all abilities have
the information they require at the correct level for them.

Example Task
Investigate one medical condition which dictates adaptions to the diet.

1.3.2 Dietary
needs and
nutritional
deficiencies

Learners should understand the
nutritional needs of individuals with
specific dietary needs or nutritional
deficiencies, such as:
•  anaemia
•
•
•
•

cardiovascular disease
coeliac disease
food intolerances and allergies
type 2 diabetes.

Learners should be aware of current
trends relating to dietary issues in
Wales.

GCSE Food and Nutrition Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 16

Produce a three-day menu suitable for your chosen condition and select one of the
dishes to make in your next practical session.

The task above allows learners to apply their knowledge to a specific group they have
selected. However, teachers must ensure that all other listed conditions are also
covered, and knowledge is not restricted to the chosen one as the final assessment
could examine any of the conditions in the specification. Practical work should be
focusing on higher level skills in conjunction with Unit 3. Sensory analysis of adapted
recipes uses skills also used for the completion of Units 2 and 3.

GCSE Food and Nutrition Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 17

1.3.3 Other
factors
affecting food
choices

Learners should know factors that affect
food choices, including:
•  cultural influences
food availability
•
levels of physical activity
•
•
lifestyle
•  personal preferences
•
religious beliefs
•  socio-economic influences.

Learners will often already have a basic knowledge and understanding of several of
the aspects covered in this section due to their own family situation, their religion, the
area they live in, travel experiences, social media etc. Food choice can be used as a
common thread across many sections of the specification and all three units.
Environmental issues and sustainability are areas often covered in other subjects and
as a result learners are comfortable applying them to food choice. However, learners
might present biased arguments, and care must be taken to ensure information is
balanced and factual. Teacher led discussions and cold calling when questioning can
encourage varied, in-depth conversations and an appreciation of a wide range of
aspects that influence what people choose to eat.

Example Tasks – Short, focused activities
•  Carry out a restaurant survey in a given area to identify cultural influences.
•  Shopping basket comparison to discover how/where to shop economically.
•  Analysis of the information on food labels and why it is important.
•  Visiting speaker from the local foodbank to discuss food poverty.
•

Investigate locally produced commodities and compare their carbon footprint with
those produced nationally and internationally.
Identify seasonal ingredients and prepare dishes using them.

•

The opportunities are extensive when looking at factors affecting food choice, but time
is a limiting factor. Teachers need to make the natural links when delivering the
specification and highlight relevant factors during food preparation sessions.

Learners should understand the impact
of food choices on:
•  animal welfare
•  energy balance
•  environmental sustainability
•  health and wellbeing
•  society.

Learners should be aware of:
•

the contributions cultural influences
have had on the food we eat in
Wales, including from Black, Asian
and minority ethnic communities and
individuals

•  emerging trends in relation to

lifestyle choices

•  unequal distribution of food locally,
nationally and internationally.

1.4 Cooking food

1.4.1 Why we
cook food

Content Amplification

Learners should know the reasons why
we cook food, including:
to improve safety
•
to increase shelf life of food
•
to improve digestibility and
•
palatability.

GCSE Food and Nutrition Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 18

Teacher Guidance

Class discussions are a good way to focus the subject content of this module.
Teaching and learning techniques such as ‘Think-Pair-Share’ and ‘Everybody
Writes’ can be used as starting points for this module by using prompts similar to
those below:
•  Discuss the benefits of cooking food.
•  Describe ways we can improve the flavour, texture and appearance of food.
•  Explain ways that we can improve the shelf-life of food.
•  Discuss the ways we can ensure food is safe to eat.
•  What are some ways to make food easier to digest, and why is this important?

Information gained can be reinforced and applied during any practical tasks carried
out.

1.4.2 Methods
of heat
transfer

Learners should understand how heat is
transferred when cooking food,
including:
•  conduction
•  convection
radiation.
•

Teachers can make cross-curricular links with science for simple explanations of
conduction, convection and radiation as learners will have studied heat transfer in
Science and Technology. Teachers need to ensure that learners are able to provide
specific food examples in order to demonstrate their ability to apply knowledge to
given situations. Simple practical tasks can be undertaken to demonstrate heat
transfer.

Learners should be aware that some
dishes rely on more than one method of
heat transfer.

Example Task – Breakfast
•  Conduction – fry an egg (dry fry and discuss the coagulation of protein)
•  Convection – pot of tea (use a glass jug and tea leaves to observe the convection

currents)

•  Radiation – toast (use the grill and observe the changes).

Serve the egg on toast together with a cup of tea and link discussions to 1.4.1 – Why
do we cook food?

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

GCSE Food and Nutrition Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 19

Example Task
Many recipes rely on a combination of heat transfer methods in order to cook
successfully.

Select a recipe you have made which illustrates this e.g. Victoria sandwich.

This element is designed to be delivered in conjunction with the investigational and
practical work assessed in Units 2 and 3. Focused questioning during these sessions
will allow teachers to track and monitor progression of learner understanding of heat
transfer. Use of equipment is relevant here too, e.g. wooden spoons versus metal
spoons for stirring hot liquids, ceramic quiche dishes versus metal quiche tins when
baking pastry cases.

Teachers should try to plan and deliver this section in conjunction with the Unit 2
investigational work and Unit 3 practical tasks. There is plenty of scope to map
practical skills with different cooking methods used locally, nationally and
internationally. Correct technical terms should be reinforced in preparation for any
recall or application of knowledge for the Unit 1 assessment. Resources will dictate
equipment available for the learners to use, but an awareness of trends and
developments in cooking methods and equipment e.g. air fryers, is important. This can
be researched online where information and tutorials etc. are readily available.

Example Task – TV Review
Select a cookery programme of your choice e.g. Nadiya’s Cook Once Eat Twice.
Watch the programme carefully and write a review based on:
•  cooking methods used to produce the dishes
•  cultural influences on recipes made
•  origin of ingredients used in the recipes
•

the environmental impact of cooking the selected food.

This task is suitable for a homework exercise and can be tailored to suit learner ability
and the focus of the lessons before or after it. There are natural links with module
1.3.3. Teachers might prefer to select the programme for the class and watch this in
school in order to consolidate learning and highlight discussion points linked to other
modules. Extension work might include the preparation of dishes influenced by other
cultures.

1.4.3 Cooking
methods

Learners should understand the effects
of a selection of cooking methods,
including:
•  dry methods
fat based
•
•  water based.

Learners should be aware of:
•  cooking methods introduced from

other cultures, including from Black,
Asian and minority ethnic
communities and cultures
the environmental impact of cooking.

•

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

GCSE Food and Nutrition Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 20

Example Task
Examine the list of recipes that you have completed during your GCSE course.
Identify the methods of cooking used to make each dish and comment on how the
cooking affects the finished outcome. This could include:
•  nutritional value
•  appearance
texture
•
flavour.
•

Learners could complete this task in the form of a table and write a conclusion. The
task could be easily extended to identify the methods of heat transfer, different
cultures studied and/or equipment used. All practical tasks should be planned with a
clear focus and every opportunity taken to reinforce as many areas of the specification
as possible that naturally occur.

1.5 Food spoilage

Content Amplification

Teacher Guidance

1.5.1 Storage
and
temperature
control

Learners should know how to store
foods correctly, including:
•  dry and cold storage
•  packaging and covering
•

refrigeration and freezing.

The focal point for this module will be the main conditions required for the
multiplication of micro-organisms: food, warmth, moisture and time. This will underpin
the topic. A sound understanding of these conditions will help learners to respond well
to questions based on all elements of this module. Progression will be evident when
conditions for multiplication are applied theoretically to given situations and used
correctly when undertaking practical tasks.

Learners should understand the risks of
not storing food correctly for themselves
and others.

Learners should be aware of Food
Standards Agency (FSA) guidelines for
storing and cooking food, including:
•  cooking and reheating
•
temperature control
•  use by and best before dates.

Teachers should take advantage of the opportunity for learners to navigate the Food
Standards Agency website.

Example Task – Starter
1.  Watch the ‘Multiplication song (Jeff Simmonds)’ found on YouTube.
2.  Watch again and identify three important points.

Learners could identify the names of pathogenic bacteria, conditions required for
reproduction, binary division and symptoms of food poisoning. There is an opportunity
for application of numeracy skills here.

Example Task
Carry out a storage survey in your kitchen at home. Make a note of where different
foods are stored and comment on the suitability of the location.

This task can be adapted and carried out in the classroom if necessary and
differentiated to include an in-depth analysis linking to key temperatures (1.5.2), types
of food spoilage agents (1.5.4) and preservation (1.5.3). Learners should consider
what the result would be of unsuitable storage of foods.

1.5.2 Hygiene
and safety

Learners should understand
microbiological principles when
preparing, cooking and serving food,
including:
•  personal hygiene practices and

procedures
food safety practices and procedures

•
•  key temperatures for food safety,

storage and cooking

•  physical, biological and chemical

contamination.

It is likely that teachers will deliver some of this information at the beginning of the
course in order to ensure safe and hygienic practices when learners are preparing
food e.g. personal hygiene. However, it is important that learners are prepared for the
Unit 1 assessment and therefore detailed information including different types of
contamination, accurate temperatures, important points to consider when buying,
storing, preparing and cooking food are all needed.

Example Task
Resource – Teacher compiles a selection of photographs linked with real life food
hygiene and safety situations, both good and bad. These could include evidence
collected during practical lessons of personal hygiene as well as storage, preparation
and cooking of food. Try to include evidence of food temperature probes being used,
fridge/freezer thermometers etc.

1.  Carefully examine the photographic evidence presented to you.
2.  Write a critical review of the food preparation area and people working in it.
3.  Suggest any improvements you think are necessary, giving clear reasons why.

Example Task
Case studies – these could include scenarios linked to:
•  street food and festivals
•  buffets for any occasions
•  care settings
•  schools and nurseries
restaurants and cafes.
•

Teachers can write case studies linked to areas of interest and build in the level of
demand required to differentiate for learner ability and time available. Careful planning
can allow all sections of this module to be covered as there is clear cross over.
Practical work can be easily included.

1.5.3
Preservation

Learners should know preservation
techniques that help keep food for
longer, including:
•  bottling
•  canning
•
•
•  pickling
•  vacuum packing.

freeze-drying
jam making

Learners should be aware of industrial
methods of preservation used in food
production.

As with 1.5.1, the focal point for this module will be the main conditions required for
the multiplication of micro-organisms: food, warmth, moisture and time. Learners will
understand that one or more of these conditions will need to be removed in order to
preserve foods. Cross-curricular links to science can be utilised when explaining
concepts such as osmosis and the surface area of ice crystals during fast and slow
freezing.

Example Task – Short, focused activities
•  Mind map – why do we preserve food?
•  How can we preserve food to reduce food waste?
•  What is irradiation and how is it used to preserve food?
•  Use YouTube clips to explain techniques such as freeze drying, MAP etc.
•  Completion of a preservation table:

Method of preservation  How this method works

Food examples

Teachers should reinforce the presence of internal and external food spoilage agents
and the most successful ways of preventing deterioration of specific foods at home
and in industry. Terms such as blanching, available moisture, enzymic activity etc. are
important and demonstrate a good level of understanding when applied correctly by
learners.

Learners should know:
•

the types of food poisoning
bacteria, including campylobacter,
salmonella, e-coli, Staphylococcus
Norovirus, listeria
the  symptoms  commonly  associated
with food poisoning.

•

Learners should be aware of the risks
and consequences of inadequate or
unacceptable food hygiene practices.

GCSE Food and Nutrition Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 24

Teachers can introduce and discuss food poisoning in isolation, with learners
investigating the named micro-organisms, food sources, incubation period and
symptoms. This could be presented in a table and used where appropriate e.g. Unit 3,
as well as being an ideal revision resource for learners at the end of the course. ‘Food
poisoning’ can be integrated in 1.5.2, when discussing biological contamination, and
by extending tasks to include specific foods which might become contaminated or
cause food poisoning due to incorrect handling and cooking procedures.

Carefully designed case studies can cover all aspects of 1.5. Food Spoilage and
practical tasks will reinforce the information.

Links made to 1.5.1 – Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Environmental Health
Officers (EHOs) will ensure that learners are aware of the risks and consequences of
inadequate or unacceptable food hygiene practices.

Teacher Guidance

Teachers might consider conducting an audit across the curriculum and/or a learner
voice exercise in order to establish any prior knowledge of this topic. Natural links can
be made with 1.1: Food Commodity Groups, Unit 2 investigational work and Unit 3
practical tasks and all areas could be covered when planning these lessons. The
focus for this element is the methods used to source food and should include:
•  caught: trawling, purse seining, dredging, line fishing, farmed and pots
•  grown: arable – cereals, fruit, vegetables, pulses and nuts
•

reared: factory, organic, free range, extensive and intensive.

Learners need an awareness of how the foods they eat are sourced and where in the
world commodities are caught, grown and reared. They should appreciate the
importance of Welsh produce such as dairy products, and the benefits that buying
locally bring to the community.

Example Task – Short, focused activity
Where does it come from?
Teachers could produce a range of flash cards with pictures of foods caught, grown
and reared locally, nationally or internationally. This will focus the learners and provide
opportunity for questioning, discussion and checking learner progress and subject

be extended to include the methods of transport on a local, national and international
scale. Learners should make the link between food safety and refrigerated transport
and be aware of the importance of the links in the cold chain when getting high risk
food from farm to field.

Learners should understand the
environmental issues associated with
food, including:
food miles
•
•
intensive farming
•  extensive farming.

Example Task
A wide range of fruit and vegetables are available in our supermarkets all year round.
1.  Identify fruits and vegetables produced locally, nationally and internationally and

investigate the food miles linked to these products.

2.  Comment on the environmental impact these fruits and vegetables have,

suggesting ways to reduce food miles.

Learners should be aware of the
availability of seasonal foods and issues
relating to food security.

Learners should understand the
advantages and disadvantages of buying
food locally.

Example Task
Farmers markets, farm shops, pick your own and veg box schemes are outlets for
locally produced foods. They often supply seasonal products which are loose and not
pre-packaged.

Prepare a presentation pitching a new pop-up farmers market to your local council.
Your pitch needs to highlight the benefits that the scheme would bring to the food
producers, the consumer, the local community and the environment.

Teachers should reinforce terminology such as carbon footprint, food security,
seasonal produce, intensive farming and extensive farming for both tasks.
Progression will show the justification of points made, as well as consistent use of
subject specific terminology. Learners should be encouraged to apply their cross-
curricular knowledge.

•
•  packaging.

All practical sessions demonstrate how primary food products are changed into
secondary food products. Questioning and discussions during these practical tasks
deepen thinking and develop a holistic understanding of the subject matter. Nutritional
value, sensory qualities and shelf life should be considered at each stage. Continued
use of subject terminology helps learners to connect the different modules and make
their own cross-curricular links when applying knowledge and understanding to higher
tariff questions during the Unit 1 online assessment.

•  processing methods to change

primary food products into secondary
food products, including:
flour to bread
•
fruit to jams, jellies, juices
•
•  milk to cheese and yoghurt.

Learners should be aware of:
•

the effects of processing foods on:
•  nutritional value
•  sensory qualities
•  shelf life of food.

Example Task - Primary Processing
Where does flour come from?

Investigate the primary processing of wheat.

•
•  Comment on how the processing affects the nutritional value, sensory qualities

and shelf life.

Teachers can extend the task by including a range of different flours and, if resources
allow, learners could sieve wholemeal flour and work out the percentage of bran per
100g. Links could be made to Unit 2 when investigating the gelatinisation of starch
and the suitability of different flours and ratios to produce a sauce. YouTube offers
numerous clips of primary processing of ingredients e.g. wheat into flour - ’Where
does flour come from?’

Example Task – Secondary Processing
•  Use your knowledge and understanding of the physical properties of ingredients to

discuss secondary processing of foods.

•  Select one of your ingredients and prepare a dish to illustrate the secondary

processing of food.

Teachers can guide learners to select dishes using high level skills and extend the
task by setting evaluation exercises in preparation for Units 2 and 3. YouTube offers
numerous clips of secondary processing e.g. how to make cheese and yoghurt,
turning fruit into jam, how to make breakfast cereals etc.
