Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:
•  A specification: this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to

know by the end of their course.

•  An assessment pack: this contains the Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) i.e.

sample exam papers and sample NEA tasks, relevant controls for the NEA and mark
schemes.

This guide builds upon the information in the specification and assessment pack to help
further your understanding.

Understanding the specification amplification

Learners should be made aware of:
•
•  what the specification stems mean.

the specification stems

Specification Stems

When you look through the specification you will notice that in the amplification column we
use a variety of wording before the list of content learners need to know; we call this a stem.

Amplification

Specification Stem

Learners should:

•  understand the nutritional value of the food commodity

groups

•  be aware of the contributions cultural influences have had
on the food we eat in Wales, including from Black, Asian
and minority ethnic communities and individuals.

Each stem is used for a slightly different reason:

understanding.

Learners should be made aware of:
•  what command words are
•  what each command word means
•  what each command word assesses.

Command words are the words and phrases used in assessments that tell learners how they
should answer the question or complete the task. Command words direct the learner through
the question or task and indicate the nature of the response required.
