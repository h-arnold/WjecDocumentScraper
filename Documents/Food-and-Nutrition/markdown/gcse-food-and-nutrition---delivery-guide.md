## Aims of the Delivery Guide

The aim of the Delivery Guide is to give an overview of the qualification and to help teachers understand how we assess the GCSE. It will offer an introduction to the specification, an assessment overview, and will support teachers in better understanding how to prepare their learners for the assessment of the different units. More information on each unit can be found in the separate unit guides.

<span id="page-4-1"></span>

## Qualification Structure

## Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:

- A specification: this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to know by the end of their course.
- An assessment pack: this contains the Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) i.e. sample exam papers and sample NEA tasks, relevant controls for the NEA and mark schemes.

This guide builds upon the information in the specification and assessment pack to help further your understanding.

<span id="page-7-1"></span>

## Understanding the specification amplification

Learners should be made aware of:

- the specification stems
- what the specification stems mean.

<span id="page-7-2"></span>

## Specification Stems

When you look through the specification you will notice that in the amplification column we use a variety of wording before the list of content learners need to know; we call this a stem.

![](_page_7_Figure_12.jpeg)

Each stem is used for a slightly different reason:

| Specification Stem             | When it is used                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Learners should<br>know        | When learners are required to demonstrate basic knowledge and<br>understanding.                                                                                                    |
| Learners should be<br>aware of | When learners need a basic knowledge of the specified content<br>and this does not need to be taught in detail.                                                                    |
| Learners should<br>understand  | When learners are required to demonstrate greater depth<br>of<br>knowledge and understanding, application of knowledge to<br>contexts, and evaluation and analysis of information. |
| Learners should be<br>able to  | When learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding<br>to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills<br>and techniques.                        |

## Command words

Learners should be made aware of:

- what command words are
- what each command word means
- what each command word assesses.

Command words are the words and phrases used in assessments that tell learners how they should answer the question or complete the task. Command words direct the learner through the question or task and indicate the nature of the response required.

![](_page_8_Picture_7.jpeg)

The following tables are not exhaustive, but will give you a good idea of the command words we typically use:

| Command words for direct recall |                                                                                                                                                                                                           |  |  |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|

## Mark Schemes

Mark schemes and/or assessment criteria test the intended learning outcomes for a unit. They describe the knowledge and skills (and possibly attitude) that a candidate is expected to demonstrate in their responses, and are then used in marking the work.

## **Objective based mark scheme**

For very short answer questions requiring one correct response.

|   | Question |     | Answer                                                         | AO1 | AO2 | AO3 | Total<br>Mark |

|   |          |     | Award 1 mark<br>for the correct answer:<br>•<br>Carbohydrates. | 1   |     |     | 1             |

## **Points based mark scheme**

For short answer questions with a range of possible responses.
