# <span id="page-3-0"></span>About this pack: information for teachers

This pack contains the assessment materials for Unit 2: Food Investigation.

Within this pack, you will find:

- information for teachers on how to manage arrangements for assessment
- a mark record sheet
- a **candidate pack** which includes:
  - details of the assignment
  - a detailed breakdown of each task
  - information for candidates, which tells candidates about things that they must and must not do when they are completing the assessment
  - the mark scheme which must be used to assess candidate work
  - a Candidate Declaration Form
  - a Candidate Time Record sheet.

**You must provide each candidate with a copy of the complete candidate assessment pack.**

#### **Managing the assessment**

This is a centre-marked (internal) non-examination assessment. The following arrangements must be followed when managing and marking the assessment.

#### **Time**

Candidates must be allowed **8 hours** to complete this assessment. Candidates should spend approximately:

- 2 hours completing Task 1
- 4 hours completing Task 2
- 2 hours completing Task 3.

The time suggested for each task takes account of the contribution of the task to the overall assessment requirements. There can be no changes to the total time available for this assessment. Centres can, however, amend the suggested time available for each task.

#### **Resources**

Candidates must have access to the candidate assessment pack and any necessary resources, as specified in the detailed task tables within the candidate pack.

#### **Collaboration**

Group work is allowed. Candidates can collaborate for task/s 1 and 2.

#### **Supervision**

Candidates must be supervised by an assessor whilst completing the activities. Centres must have in place systems to ensure candidates cannot access evidence they have been developing outside of supervised activities.

{4}------------------------------------------------

#### **Authentication**

Supervision must be in place to ensure the authenticity of evidence produced for summative assessment.

You should not provide input or guidance to candidates during the assessment time. This includes providing formative feedback on the evidence being produced. You can provide guidance on the requirements of the task and remind candidates of the mark bands and how they can be interpreted.

Candidates can review and redraft evidence independently within the time controls for the assessment.

Candidates must sign the declaration to confirm that all evidence submitted for moderation is their own work and that any sources used have been acknowledged.

Assessors must sign the declaration to confirm that evidence submitted for moderation was completed under the controlled conditions set out in this assessment.

#### **Candidate evidence**

The acceptable formats for evidence of each of the tasks is summarised in the task tables. Any modified assessment must enable the candidate to generate the evidence required in this table.

#### **Marking the assessment**

The marking scheme for this assessment are included in the candidate pack.

All marking of evidence must be made against the marking scheme provided. Evidence marked must comply with any requirements set out in the assessment pack.

Written evidence must be annotated to show how it relates to the mark band requirements.

Marking should only be undertaken by a designated assessor. An assessor should have appropriate expertise in the subject and level for a specified unit. The assessor is responsible for ensuring that:

- assessment is conducted under the controls specified in the task table
- they are clear about the requirements of the assessment and marking scheme prior to commencing assessment
- evidence presented for assessment is valid, authentic; reliable and credible
- assessment decisions are accurately recorded
- evidence is appropriately annotated
- judgements are only made against the mark band statements

A mark record sheet must be completed for each candidate.

#### **Further information**

You should refer the JCQ Instructions for conducting non-examination assessment for further information on managing assessment within our GCSE Qualifications.

**This pack is a sample. It must not be used for live assessment.**

# About this pack: information and instructions for candidates

This candidate assessment pack is for candidates completing Unit 2: Food Investigation.

Within this pack, you will find:

- your assignment
- a detailed breakdown of each task, the evidence requirements, and the conditions (controls) under which the task is to be completed
- information for candidates, which tells you about things that you must and must not do when you are completing the assessment
- the mark scheme which will be used to assess your work
- a Declaration Form
- a Time Record sheet.

#### **You will have 8 hours in total to complete this assessment.** You should spend approximately:

- 2 hours completing Task 1
- 4 hours completing Task 2
- 2 hours completing Task 3.

You will be supervised throughout the assessment.

Your teacher is allowed to help you to understand the assessment requirements briefs and the tasks, but there are rules about the kind of help and how much they can give you. You should speak to your teacher if you have any questions about what you are and are not allowed to do as you are completing the tasks, as they will know how much help they are allowed to give you.

It is important that you work independently from other candidates and the work produced should be your own unaided work. You and your teacher will be required to sign a declaration that all work presented is your own work.

You are advised to check your work carefully to make sure that it is accurate and correct.

# Assignment

Produce written evidence on the working characteristics, functional and chemical properties of ingredients in a recipe through conducting a food investigation which includes collecting, analysing and presenting results to test a hypothesis.

The **recommended** written evidence is 2000 - 2500 words for the written evidence for all **three** tasks.

You have a total of **8** hours to complete this assignment.

#### Brief A

"Fruit is often preserved and added to a recipe to enhance the characteristics of the dish." Investigate the working characteristics, function and chemical properties of using different types of preserved fruit when making a batch of cupcakes.

This assignment must be supported by investigational work – refer to guidance given below.

#### Brief B

"Meat can be tenderised before cooking." Investigate the working characteristics, function and chemical properties of using different methods to tenderise meat.

This assignment must be supported by investigational work – refer to guidance given below.

You are required to conduct a food investigation.

You **may** work collaboratively as a group, as instructed by your teacher, to complete some elements of some tasks, as described below:

- Task 1
  - (a) (\*) Develop a hypothesis (please note the research element of Task 1 is an individual task).
  - (b) Produce a plan a discussion to develop a shared plan.
- Task 2
  - (a) Collecting results.

You may develop a shared hypothesis, discuss a shared food investigation plan and collect the same results as a member of a group, but you **must** have your own individual interpretations and evidence of these tasks. All written evidence submitted for the assessment **must** be your own work.

Please note this **i**s **not** a group assignment. You do **not** have to work as a group and your teacher will support you in making that decision. Your teacher will monitor this group work carefully to ensure that each of your contribution can be separately assessed.

The production of the control food item outcome may be undertaken by the teacher in the form of a demonstration. Whether you, or the teacher produces the control food item outcome, no marks are awarded for this task.

# Information for candidates

The following information has been taken from the [JCQ Information for candidates](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) – non[examination assessments](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) and the [JCQ Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) Use in Assessments:](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/)  [Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/) This tells you about things that you **must** and **must not** do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not understand, you **must** ask your teacher.

#### **Preparing your work**

- When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you need to ensure that your final product reflects your own independent work and isn't copied or paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
- If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you **must** tell your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
- If you worked as part of a group on a task, you **must** each write up your own account of the assignment. Even if the data you have is the same, you **must** describe in your own words how that data was obtained, and you **must** independently draw your own conclusions from the data.
- Take care of your work and keep it safe. **Do not** leave it lying around where your classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You **must** always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; **do not** share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
- **Do not** be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI tools and chatbots) – this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort of copying.
- You **must not** write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

#### **Plagiarism**

Plagiarism involves taking someone else's words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them off as your own. **It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously.** Don't think you won't be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:

- Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
- Markers are highly experienced subject specialists they may have read the source you are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!
- Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and style of writing or punctuation.

#### **Penalties for breaking the regulations**

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be applied:

- the piece of work will be awarded zero marks
- you will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question
- you will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series
- you will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

**Remember – it's your qualification so it needs to be your own work.**

{14}------------------------------------------------

#### **MARK SCHEME**

#### **Guidance for assessors**

#### **Generic marking principles**

#### **Assessment grids for non-examination assessment**

#### **Banded mark schemes**

Banded mark schemes are divided so that each band within a section has a relevant descriptor. The descriptor for the band provides a description of the performance level for that band. Each band contains marks. Before marking, the teacher should first read and annotate a candidate's project to pick out the evidence that is being assessed. Once the annotation is complete, the mark scheme can be applied.

This is done as a two-stage process.

#### **Stage 1 – Deciding on the band**

Beginning at the lowest band, the teacher should look at the appropriate section of the candidate's work and check whether it matches the descriptor for that section's mark band. The teacher should look at the descriptor for that band and see if it matches the qualities shown in the candidate's work for that section. If the descriptor at the lowest band is satisfied, the teacher should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the descriptor matches the work. If a candidate's work covers different aspects of different bands within the mark scheme, a 'best fit' approach should be adopted to decide on the band and then the candidate's work should be used to decide on the mark within the band. For instance, if work is mainly in band 2 but with a limited amount of band 3 content, the work would be placed in band 2, but the mark awarded would be close to the top of band 2 as a result of the band 3 content. Teachers should not seek to mark candidates down as a result of small omissions in minor areas of their work.

#### **Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark**

Once the band has been decided, the teachers can then assign a mark. The teachers are reminded of the need to revisit the work as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the work submitted. Where work is not credit worthy, that is, contains nothing of any significance to the project, or has been omitted, no marks should be awarded. Internal standardisation is essential, that where there is more than one teacher in a centre, work from all teaching groups is standardised internally. This is designed to ensure that the final assessment reflects a single agreed standard for all teaching groups involved.

{15}------------------------------------------------

## Mark scheme

The following mark scheme will be used to assess your work.

**0 marks will be awarded if there is no evidence or submitted work is not worthy of credit.**

#### **Task 1**

#### **Planning the food investigation**

- (a) The candidate has researched the working characteristics, function and chemical properties of the food specified in your chosen brief
