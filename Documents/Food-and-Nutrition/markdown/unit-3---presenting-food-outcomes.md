3.3.4

{4}------------------------------------------------



The Specification does not specify how many portions have to be prepared or presented. As this task can be expensive it makes sense to cut down on portions, and serve individual dishes as opposed to larger 'family sized' items.

<!-- image -->

It DOES however specify a photograph in colour of each dish plus a photo of the completed three dishes and any accompaniments together

{5}------------------------------------------------



## TGAU GCSE

Good practice could be for learners to include images of any complex techniques they have performed in their dishes to aid the justification of the marks awarded by the teacher to the moderator.

Meatballs and pasta with garlic dough balls. Scotch eggs with mayonnaise Lemon tart, meringue kisses and coulis

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Remember - the only evidence the moderator has is the photos and the mark sheet. If this was the only photograph included in the work. It would be very difficult for the moderator to agree the practical marks. There should be an individual photograph of each dish with its accompaniments as well as a photo of all dishes together. This candidate has demonstrated a number of high-level techniques, but the photograph does not do the work justice.

## Not sure where to start on food styling?...

## Get professional help....

- Local college
- Careers Wales
- Parents
- Local businesses

Get help. Careers Wales has a department that can find professionals to come into schools or you can take your learners out to their workplaces. Is there a local college with a catering department that you can either visit or arrange for someone to come out and do a lesson on plating and garnishing? What about parents? Surely someone is chef who can spare an hour to do a dem with your Year 10? Many learners may have a part time job in a local hospitality business, can that business help? This is also building links within your wider school community. Your SMT will love you for that!

{7}------------------------------------------------



<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

We always work with the learners to get them the best mark that they can achieve. Many struggle with the written element, but excel at the practical, so you need to ensure that they get the best mark they can for this element.



{8}------------------------------------------------



Think garnishes and accompaniments. These not only look good but also add skills &amp; techniques to the dishes which can also help increase marks.

- Coulis
- Fruit &amp; vegetables
- Herbs
- Chocolate work
- Sugar work

As lovely as this pie is, think of the cost and time to prepare, would an individual small pie have been a better choice, or cut a slice from this pie to show the filling?



{9}------------------------------------------------



TGAU GCSE

Choices are vital; these dishes do not allow for high marks to be awarded, but you also cannot ignore presentation.

No garnish

<!-- image -->

Scrambled eggs and salad Margherita Pizza Cinnamon whirl



{10}------------------------------------------------



## Couscous, Zaalouk and Mahalabia

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Think colour and texture as well as techniques. This learner has selected 2 dishes with couscous, an aubergine and tomato bake and a custardbased dish. All soft textures and of a similar colour.



{11}------------------------------------------------



TGAU GCSE

Carbonara with focaccia Quiche with side salad Meringue with fruit and a coulis

<!-- image -->

Think about…

<!-- image -->

Negatives: Would you serve a hard-boiled egg as a part of a side salad with a quiche? Not the best way to serve a side salad.

Are 5 pieces of focaccia too much with the carbonara? Would they be better served separately? The bowl is overfull.  Is Rosemary an appropriate garnish for carbonara?

Positives: The dessert is well presented with thought to portion size and appropriate garnishing. Piped cream and the fruit coulis also adding techniques.

The individual quiche looks good.



{12}------------------------------------------------



TGAU GCSE

<!-- image -->

Think about…

<!-- image -->

Could these dishes have been improved with a better garnish and accompaniments?

Candidate has tried with icing sugar and spoon technique good but would a plain background have been better for the photographs? Remember - it doesn't need to be a table-cloth, you can use cardboard or sugar paper.

Presentation

<!-- image -->

Increasing fibre task - chickpea burger in a wholemeal bun Passion fruit Millionaire's shortbread Pea pasta &amp; sausage Lasagne with garlic bread

Lasagne - to cut down on cost and time, one individual dish would perhaps have been better ?  and served with a side salad no accompaniments with the burger, small salad garnish or wedges perhaps?

Shortbread is all uneven and not equal portions. Could the candidate have done some feathering with white chocolate ?

Remember: The Specification does not say how many portions to produce.

TGAU GCSE

Things to consider

What about a lesson in food photography?

Are you teaching garnishing techniques?

Not all learners will have access to serving dishes/plates - Put a message on your staff bulletin asking for help with serving dishes/cutlery/tablecloths. You will be inundated with donations. Can the PTA help?

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Have a food styling lesson and challenge. Get the class to make a cheesecake and award prizes for the best presentation and garnishes.



{15}------------------------------------------------



<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Good Practice: A few well chosen photos of the complex techniques used.



{16}------------------------------------------------



TGAU GCSE

Consider smaller portions and individual dishes, this cuts down on the preparation time and the cost.
