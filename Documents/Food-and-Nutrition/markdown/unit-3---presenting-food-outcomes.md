UNIT 3 Food and Nutrition in Action

PRESENTING FOOD OUTCOMES.

Unit 3

The amplification clearly notes:
Learners should be able to present food in a
suitable manner, reflecting the audience and
purpose.

3.2.2

The new specification has
much more emphasis on
the presenting of food.

The amplification clearly notes:
Learners should be able to demonstrate suitable
techniques to present dishes.

3.3.2

Learners should be able to evaluate the success of
food outcomes using the following factors:
• presenting and serving

3.3.4

The Specification does
not specify how many
portions have to be
prepared or
presented. As this task
can be expensive it
makes sense to cut
down on portions, and
serve individual dishes
as opposed to larger
“family sized” items.

It DOES however specify
a photograph in colour
of each dish plus a
photo of the completed
three dishes and any
accompaniments
together

Meatballs and pasta with
garlic dough balls.
Scotch eggs with
mayonnaise
Lemon tart, meringue
kisses and coulis

Good practice could be for learners to
include images of any complex
techniques they have performed in their
dishes to aid the justification of the marks
awarded by the teacher to the moderator.

Remember – the only evidence the
moderator has is the photos and the mark
sheet. If this was the only photograph
included in the work. It would be very
difficult for the moderator to agree the
practical marks. There should be an
individual photograph of each dish with
its accompaniments as well as a photo of
all dishes together. This candidate has
demonstrated a number of high-level
techniques, but the photograph does not
do the work justice.

Not sure where to start on
food styling?...

Get help. Careers Wales has a department that can find
professionals to come into schools or you can take your
learners out to their workplaces. Is there a local college
with a catering department that you can either visit or
arrange for someone to come out and do a lesson on
plating and garnishing? What about parents? Surely
someone is chef who can spare an hour to do a dem
with your Year 10? Many learners may have a part time
job in a local hospitality business, can that business
help? This is also building links within your wider school
community. Your SMT will love you for that!

We always work with the
learners to get them the
best mark that they can
achieve. Many struggle
with the written element,
but excel at the
practical, so you need to
ensure that they get the
best mark they can for
this element.

Think garnishes and accompaniments. These not only look
good but also add skills & techniques to the dishes which can
also help increase marks.

• Coulis
• Fruit & vegetables
• Herbs
• Chocolate work
• Sugar work

As lovely as this pie is, think
of the cost and time to
prepare, would an individual
small pie have been a better
choice, or cut a slice from this
pie to show the filling?

Choices are vital; these dishes do not allow
for high marks to be awarded, but you also
cannot ignore presentation.

No garnish

Scrambled eggs
and salad
Margherita Pizza
Cinnamon whirl

Think colour and texture as
well as techniques. This learner
has selected 2 dishes with
couscous, an aubergine and
tomato bake and a custard-
based dish. All soft textures
and of a similar colour.

Think about…

Negatives: Would you serve a hard-boiled egg as a
part of a side salad with a quiche? Not the best
way to serve a side salad.
Are 5 pieces of focaccia too much with the
carbonara? Would they be better served
separately? The bowl is overfull.  Is Rosemary an
appropriate garnish for carbonara?

Positives: The dessert is well presented with
thought to portion size and appropriate
garnishing. Piped cream and the fruit coulis also
adding techniques.
The individual quiche looks good.

Think about…

Could these dishes have been
improved with a better garnish
and accompaniments?

Candidate has tried with icing
sugar and spoon technique –
good but would a plain
background have been better for
the photographs? Remember – it
doesn’t need to be a table-cloth,
you can use cardboard or sugar
paper.

Presentation

Increasing fibre task – chickpea burger in a
wholemeal bun
Passion fruit Millionaire’s shortbread
Pea pasta & sausage Lasagne with garlic
bread
Lasagne – to cut down on cost and time,
one individual dish would perhaps have
been better ?  and served with a side salad -
no accompaniments with the burger, small
salad garnish or wedges perhaps?
Shortbread is all uneven and not equal
portions. Could the candidate have done
some feathering with white chocolate ?

Remember: The Specification does not say
how many portions to produce.

Things to
consider

Not all learners will have access
to serving dishes/plates - Put a
message on your staff bulletin
asking for help with serving
dishes/cutlery/tablecloths. You
will be inundated with donations.
Can the PTA help?

White background,
simple serving dishes.

What about a lesson in
food photography?

Are you teaching
garnishing techniques?

Have a food styling lesson
and challenge. Get the
class to make a
cheesecake and award
prizes for the best
presentation and
garnishes.

Good Practice:
A few well -
chosen photos
of the complex
techniques
used.

Consider smaller portions and
individual dishes, this cuts down
on the preparation time and the
cost.
