| 3.1.1<br>The factors<br>that influence<br>food and<br>ingredient<br>choices | Learners should understand the factors that affect<br>food and ingredient choices, when planning and<br>preparing meals and menus, including:<br>• cultural influences<br>• food availability and seasonality<br>• levels of physical activity<br>• lifestyles<br>• nutritional needs across life stages<br>• personal preferences<br>• religious beliefs<br>• sensory qualities<br>• shelf life of food<br>• socio-economic influences<br>• specific dietary needs or nutritional deficiencies<br>• emerging trends related to factors that affect food<br>and ingredient choices<br>• benefits of using locally sourced, Welsh food. | Learners need to understand the different reasons that influence people's<br>food and ingredient choices. These include:<br>• Cultural influences:<br>• Culture refers to the ideas, customs, and social behaviour of a<br>particular people or society. Cultural influences could be taught<br>alongside religious beliefs.<br>• Food availability and seasonality:<br>• Not everyone has the same access to food. This could be due to<br>environmental factors such as the climate, terrain, whether the<br>food can be grown locally or not and what shops are available to<br>buy from. Teachers should also highlight how global events (e.g.<br>wars or pandemics) affect food availability.<br>• Certain fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, seafood and game are<br>grown, reared or harvested at certain times of the year. Teachers<br>need to make learners aware of the benefits of eating foods in<br>season (they can be cheaper, have more flavour, are fresher,<br>better for the environment, supports local economies and are<br>more nutritious) and how these factors will impact on food and<br>ingredient choices. Seasonality will build on learning in Sections<br>1.1.1, 1.6.1 and 1.6.2.<br>• Levels of physical activity:<br>• An individual's physical activity level (PAL) will impact their food<br>choice. For example, athletes would require a higher intake of<br>complex carbohydrate foods, such as rice and pasta, than an<br>average person to ensure they meet their energy needs.<br>• Weightlifters would require more protein rich foods in their diet<br>such as eggs and chicken to aid growth and repair of muscle cells.<br>• Conversely, people who lead a sedentary lifestyle would need to<br>consume less carbohydrate-based foods than an average person<br>as they are using less energy and so would risk putting on weight<br>due to more calories being consumed than are required. |

{8}------------------------------------------------

An older person would require more Vitamin D and Calcium rich foods such as milk, spinach and oily fish to prevent decalcification from bones and teeth.

### Lifestyle s :

• An individual's lifestyle can affect their food choice. F or example, people who lead busy lives may rely more on convenience foods and ready meals, whereas someone who is health conscious may buy more healthy ingredients and prepare and cook their own meals.

:

- Nutritional needs across life stages
  - There are different nutritional needs and requirements across infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and later adulthood. Learners should know what foods these different life stages may require more or less of. This can be linked with the teaching and learning of Section 1.3.1 .
- Personal preferences:
  - This will be dependent on an individual's likes and dislikes and how that may impact their food choice.
- Religious beliefs :
  - Some religions have dietary food laws that may limit food choices or forbid the eating of certain foods. Teachers should ensure that learners are aware of the diets of different religions. They should know the following religious dietary requirements :
    - Orthodox Jews must eat food that is 'kosher'. Kosher means 'fit' or 'proper'. Kosher rules mean that meat and poultry must be slaughtered and prepared according to strict Jewish laws, while pork and shellfish are forbidden , and meat and dairy products must not be prepared or eaten together.
    - Muslims are forbidden from eating meat from a pig and must not consume alcohol. Meat and poultry must be 'halal ', meaning that the animals have been slaughtered according to Islamic law as stated in the Qur 'an. Muslims will also fast between sunrise and sunset during the period of Ramadan.
    - Hindus will avoid eating beef due to their belief that the cow is sacred . Many Hindus will follow a vegetarian diet .

{9}------------------------------------------------

- Orthodox Sikhs may choose to follow a vegetarian or vegan diet. They are forbidden from eating 'halal' or 'kosher' food and must not consume alcohol.
- Buddhists will mainly follow a vegetarian or vegan diet.
- Sensory qualities :
  - The taste, texture, appearance and aroma of ingredients and meals can impact on an individual's food choice.
- Shelf life of food:
  - Use by dates and best before dates can affect an individual's food choice. Teachers can make learners aware of supermarkets Buy One Get One Free (BOGOF ) offers and reduced cost food items on 'bargain shelves' and how these need to be considered carefully when planning and preparing menus. People on low incomes may also feel that foods with a longer shelf life are more cost effective due to them being able to be stored for longer and being cheaper to buy in bulk. This could link into methods of keeping food for longer such as refrigeration, freezing or other methods of preservation listed in Section 1.5.3.
- Socio -economic influences:
  - A person's income can affect their diet. People on lower incomes will be more likely to make less healthy food choices and eat less fruit and vegetables. People with higher incomes will have more opportunities and resources to be able to make healthier food choices.
- Specific dietary needs or nutritional deficiencies:
  - Different types of specific dietary needs or nutritional deficiencies will impact on a person's food and ingredient choice. This section will link with teaching and learning for Section 1.3.2. The list of dietary needs should include :
    - Coeliac disease
    - Type 2 diabetes
    - Anaemia
    - Cardiovascular disease
    - Food intolerances and allergies (e.g. gluten intolerance, lactose intolerance, peanut allergy etc.) .

{10}------------------------------------------------

- Emerging trends related to factors that affect food and ingredient choices :
  - Teachers should make learners aware of any new trends that may influence people's food and ingredients choices. For example, 2023 saw smart kitchen gadgets such as air fryers become an extremely popular piece of kitchen equipment. In 2024, Artificial Intelligence gained popularity through helping people find recipe s and create dishes to make at home.
- Benefits of using locally sourced, Welsh food
  - There are benefits of using Welsh produce, such as the benefit to the environment of fewer air miles, the possibility of local produce being cheaper, the impact of supporting the local economy and food provenance .

:

### Example activities :

Learners could be given the opportunity to plan, prepare and cook dishes that cater for a selection of groups from the list above. For example:

- Food availability and seasonality: when learning about the fruit and vegetable commodity group in Section 1.1.1, learners could then plan, prepare and cook a dish/dishes that only use fruit or vegetables that are in season at that time of year .
- Specific dietary needs or nutritional deficiencies: a practical task that require s learners to plan, prepare and cook a dish/dishes for someone that need s to increase their iron intake due to having anaemia.
- Specific dietary needs or nutritional deficiencies: a class practical session or teacher demonstration, whereby a white sauce is made using a milk alternative to suit someone with a lactose intolerance. Should this be done as a teacher demonstration, then it could provide an opportunity for learners to try the sauce and practice some of the evaluation skills listed in Section [3.3.4](#page-20-0) .

{11}------------------------------------------------

### 3.1.2 Making choices about food and ingredients

Learners should be able to consider the factors that affect food and ingredient choices to:

- make informed decisions for themselves and others about food and drink
- justify the choices for themselves and others about food and drink
- <span id="page-10-0"></span>• plan and prepare food outcomes.

Learners need to be able to make food and ingredient choices and consider a range of factors that may affect those choices, as listed in Section [3.1.1.](#page-6-2) Once learners have been able to fully consider those factors, they must be able to justify and explain the food and drink choices that they have made. The ability to make informed choices and justify them will enable learners to plan and prepare dishes suitable for themselves and others. When justifying their choice of dishes for the nonexamination assessment of this unit, consideration should be given to some of the factors listed in Section [3.1.1.](#page-6-2)

### Example activity:

Teachers can provide learners with the opportunity to choose dishes suited to a particular group of people, throughout the delivery of the course. Learners can provide reasons explaining and justifying why the dishes they have chosen are suitable. This could involve learners being asked to suggest dishes for a specific dietary need, justifying and explaining the reasons why they have chosen the dishes, in depth.

### 3.2.2 Techniques for preparing, cutting and cooking food outcomes

Learners should understand:

- the purpose of each of the techniques used to prepare, cut and cook food outcomes, as listed in Appendix A within the Specification
- the desired result of each technique on the food outcome.

Learners should be able to present food in a suitable manner, reflecting the audience and purpose.

Learners should be aware of:

- locally sourced, Welsh ingredients
- <span id="page-12-0"></span>• foods, ingredients and cooking methods that reflect the diverse cultural contributions, including from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities and individuals, on the food we eat in Wales.

Learners should be given opportunities to not only demonstrate each of the techniques listed in Appendix A within the Specification, but also understand why different techniques are used and what the desired results are. For example, when kneading dough, learners should understand that the kneading will develop the gluten to make the dough stretchy and elastic. If the dough is under kneaded then the dough will lack elasticity and structure, which may make the dough dense and lead to a poor rise.

Another example could be blind baking pastry. Learners should understand that some pastry products need to be blind baked before adding a filling to ensure the pastry is crisp and there is no soggy bottom to the pastry product.

Learners should be given opportunities throughout the course to present food in a manner which reflects the audience and purpose. This could include using different garnishing techniques, decorations or accompaniments.

Opportunities should also be provided for learners to make dishes that use locally sourced Welsh ingredients. This could be produce from the local area or dishes that use Welsh ingredients. Teachers should also provide opportunities for learners to use foods, ingredients and cooking methods from a diverse range of cultures. This could be done through practical sessions where learners prepare and make multicultural dishes.

{14}------------------------------------------------

### Example activity

Task 1 – Learners could be tasked with providing definitions for each of the skills listed in Appendix A within the Specification and examples of foods or dishes that would use that technique. If the task was completed as an online activity, then learners could also search for images of each technique to add to their work to further enhance their learning. There could be a further opportunity to extend this task by requiring learners to state the implications of performing the technique incorrectly or poorly. E.g:

| Skill               | Definition                                                                                   | Examples                                                           | Image                                                   | Possible issues                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

{15}------------------------------------------------

Task 2 – Provide learners with images of dishes that have been presented in different ways and ask them to identify the audience or purpose and explain why the food has been presented that way.

For example, you may provide a similar image to the one below.

![](_page_14_Picture_3.jpeg)

Learners would be expected to identify that it is a packed lunch for a child. A range of colourful fruit and vegetables have been included to interest the child but to also contribute to the required five fruit and vegetables a day. The sandwiches have been cut into shapes to make them more fun for the child eating them. A range of textures have been provided and the lunchbox meets the requirements of the Eatwell Guide.

Extension – learners could explore other ways the food choices could be presented e.g. Party in a leisure centre.

{16}------------------------------------------------

### 3.2.3 Hygiene practices and procedures

Learners should understand food hygiene and safety practices and procedures when preparing, cooking, presenting and storing food.

Learners should be able to prepare, cook and present food outcomes, using:

- correct personal hygiene
- safe working practices
- correct food safety practices and procedures
- correct storage and temperature control.

Learners should be aware of guidelines for:

- cooking and reheating food
- temperature control of food
- use by and best before dates.

Learners need to understand the importance of food hygiene and safety practices when preparing, cooking, presenting and storing food, and should be able to demonstrate this in a practical setting. Learners should be able to:

- understand and demonstrate correct personal hygiene practices when handling, preparing, cooking and serving food
- demonstrate safe use of all kitchen equipment
- work safely and hygienically, keeping work areas clear and clean
- understand and demonstrate how to prevent cross-contamination
- store food correctly whilst being able to understand and demonstrate the correct temperatures for the storage, cooking, hot-holding, serving and reheating of food
- understand the conditions required for bacteria to multiply and be able to minimise the risk of food poisoning
- check use by and best before dates on foods and ingredients to be used.

### Example activity:

Teachers should provide opportunities during practical lessons for learners to be able to put in to practice the theoretical knowledge gained in this area. During practical lessons, constant reference should be made to the theory that learners have been taught in Sections 1.5.1, 1.5.2 & 1.5.4 of the specification.

Although this type of activity has been suggested in<br>Section 3.2.1, the more practice learners get at adapting recipes, the<br>better. |

{18}------------------------------------------------

### 3.3.2 Selecting and using suitable preparation, cooking and serving techniques

Learners should be able to demonstrate:

- a range of suitable techniques, as listed in Appendix A within the Specification:
  - to prepare food outcomes
  - to cook food outcomes
  - to serve and present food outcomes: examples of suitable preparation, knife and cooking techniques from each level of complexity (categorised as basic, medium and complex, as listed in Appendix A within the Specification) as suitable for the food outcome produced
  - how to present and serve food items; food styling, garnishing, portion control.

Learners should be aware of:

<span id="page-17-0"></span>• developments in preparation and cooking techniques.

Task 2: Learners can then cut out each stage of the recipe and sequence/dovetail the recipes to ensure they are all served at the same time. Learners can stick the sequenced method onto a large sheet of paper, ensuring that they have 3 clear sections (mise en place, cooking and presenting and serving), have accurate timings and have included hygiene and safety points throughout.

Learners should be taught a range of preparation, knife and cooking techniques from the list in Appendix A within the Specification. They will need to understand the three categories of skill level; Basic, Medium and Complex, and be given opportunities to prepare, cook and present a range of dishes that include skills from within each category.

Learners should be able to identify the skills used within each dish they make and keep a record of what skills they have used throughout the course of the qualification. Teachers should ensure that learners are given opportunities to complete all the skills listed in Appendix A within the Specification enabling them to make informed choices when planning dishes.

Learners should be encouraged to increase the skill level of a dish where possible. For example, if learners make a pasta dish using dried pasta, then there could be an opportunity to upskill the dish by making fresh pasta.

Learners should be taught how to present food attractively whilst considering the audience and purpose of the dishes they are presenting.

Learners should be given opportunities to prepare, cook, present and serve a range of dishes that cover multiple preparation, knife and cooking techniques listed in Appendix A within the Specification. Learners should be encouraged to keep a checklist of the skills they have completed once they have made each dish, ensuring that they have completed a range of Basic, Medium and Complex skills.

### 3.3.3 Exploring the nutritional values of food outcomes

### Learners should be able to:

- explore the nutritional value of food
- suggest changes to ingredients and quantities to meet the needs of the audience in relation to the nutritional value of a food outcome.

### Learners should be aware of:

- how to calculate the nutritional value in a food outcome methods for adapting the nutritional value of food outcomes
- <span id="page-19-0"></span>• how to present and serve food items; food styling, garnishing, portion control.

Learners should be able to identify the nutrients included in the ingredients of a dish and understand their nutritional value to an individual. This is an opportunity to link with the theory knowledge gained in Unit 1. This could involve listing the main ingredients in a dish and then stating what nutrients are in each ingredient and what the function of the nutrient is in the body.

Learners must also be able to suggest changes to ingredients and quantities to suit the specific nutritive requirements of individuals or groups of people. For example, if learners have made a Quiche Lorraine, they must be able to suggest changes to the dish if it needed to be lower in fat content to suit a dietary need.

Opportunities should be given to learners to make a range of accompaniments that would be suitable for a number of different dishes.

{21}------------------------------------------------

<span id="page-20-0"></span>

### Example activities: • Learners could analyse the nutrition of dishes that they have made in lessons. This could be analysing the nutrients of the ingredients in the dishes and stating their function, or they could use a nutritional analysis program to analyse the nutritive content of the dish. This could be completed as a classroombased exercise or be set as a homework task. • Learners could research garnishes suitable for different dishes they make throughout the duration of the course. The research could include watching videos of garnishing techniques available on the internet or compiling a PowerPoint presentation of images of different techniques. They could then choose some different garnishes to practice in practical lessons. Learners could use pre-bought food items (e.g. a teacake or cherry bakewell) and spend the lesson using garnishing techniques to present the item as a finished dish. 3.3.4 Evaluating the success of food outcomes Learners should be able to evaluate the success of food outcomes using the following factors: • recipe selection • use of ingredients and quantities • preparation and cooking techniques used • time management • health, safety and hygiene • nutritional benefits • success of adaptations • presenting and serving • tasting (using sensory descriptors) • suitability for audience and purpose. Opportunities should be given to evaluate a range of different factors, as listed, and know the difference between providing an analytical evaluation as opposed to a descriptive one. This will enable learners to develop the necessary evaluation skills that can be transferred to the completion of non-examination assessments. Example activity: Classroom-based or homework tasks could be set so that learners could evaluate different amplification criteria for dishes that they have made throughout the duration of the course. This could start with learners providing verbal feedback, but as they develop their skills, progress to providing written feedback. Learners should become more confident with their evaluation skills as the course progresses, which will enable them to successfully complete the evaluation section of the non-examination assessment

**There are many opportunities to include Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in GCSE Food and Nutrition. These opportunities are important to Learners because they allow them to gain an understanding of their bodies, relationships, and overall well-being. By addressing both the physical and emotional aspects of health, these subjects can enable learners to make informed choices that contribute to a healthier, more balanced life. The interaction between food, nutrition, emotional wellbeing, and relationship health highlights the importance of fostering self-respect, consent, emotional intelligence, and resilience in students, helping them navigate their personal and social lives with confidence and responsibility.**

**Below are some examples of how RSE can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

**There are many opportunities to include Career and Work-Related Experiences (CWRE) in GCSE Food and Nutrition. These opportunities are important to Learners because it enables them to bridge the gap between academic learning and the practical world and will enable them to see the connection between what they study in the classroom and how it applies to real-world careers in food and nutrition. This could include roles in food science, nutrition, food production, catering, hospitality, public health, and sustainability. These experiences not only make the subject more engaging but also provide students with the skills, knowledge, and confidence needed for future careers and further study. By experiencing food and nutrition-related work firsthand, learners are better prepared to contribute to and succeed in a diverse and evolving industry.** 

**Below are some examples of how CWRE can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

## *Amplification Example*

*Specification Reference*

> **3.2.3 3.3.2 3.3.3**

Developing learners' knowledge and understanding about food hygiene practices and procedures will enable them to see the direct link between industry standards, workplace and customer expectations and public health requirements. By developing their practical skills to enable them to know how to handle, store, prepare, cook and serve food safely, learners will be knowledgeable, job-ready and aware of the high standards expected in the food industry.

Learners will gain theoretical knowledge about food hygiene and safety and will then be able to apply this knowledge in a practical setting. Teachers can also link the teaching of this topic to real world situations and examples as most learners will be able to make connections between this topic to food places they have visited. There could also be an opportunity for guest speakers to be invited in from industry to talk to learners (e.g. the Environmental Health Officer from the local council).

Learners will also learn how to prepare, cook, present and serve a range of dishes which are skills that would be transferrable to a food workplace setting, for example a restaurant. Learners will also be able to explore the nutritional values of the food that they make enabling them to further link what they learn in the classroom to a career in food (e.g. a food nutritionist).

### Integral Skills Creativity and Innovation There are many opportunities to include Creativity and Innovation in GCSE Food and Nutrition. These opportunities are important to Learners because they enable students to think beyond conventional methods, develop unique recipes, solve food-related problems creatively, and respond to evolving dietary and sustainability needs. These skills not only enhance students' learning and enjoyment of the subject but also prepare them with adaptable, solution-oriented approaches that are highly valuable in real-world food and nutrition contexts. Below are some examples of how Creativity and Innovation can be embedded into teaching and learning: Specification Reference Amplification Example 3.2.1 3.3.1 3.3.2 Being creative and innovative is a key skill that is required in food and nutrition to enable learners to adapt and develop recipes, create food production plans, plan meals, cook dishes and explore emerging food trends. Learners will need to be creative when adapting recipes to meet specific dietary needs, such as glutenfree, vegan, or low-sugar diets. By thinking creatively, learners can substitute ingredients or alter cooking techniques. Learners will also be creative and innovative when completing practical work. Although standard recipes and cooking methods can and will be used, learners should be allowed the flexibility, where practical and suitable to do so, to be able to adapt traditional recipes, and experiment with ingredients, flavours, and textures.
