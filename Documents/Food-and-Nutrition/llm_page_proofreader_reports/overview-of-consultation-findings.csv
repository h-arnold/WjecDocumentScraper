1,4,around the concerns,The subject-specific section of the report goes into further detail **around the concerns** raised.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The use of 'around' is informal; 'regarding' or 'about' would be more appropriate for a formal report.

23,12,during the number,Some respondents expressed concern about the potential amount of content to be covered **during the number** of teaching hours available.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'during the number of' is awkward; 'within the available' or 'given the number of' would be more natural.

28,14,pupils,Some respondents felt that the food investigation was not popular with learners and lower ability **pupils** would find this difficult.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,85,The document consistently uses 'learners' to refer to students; 'pupils' introduces an unnecessary inconsistency in terminology.
