1,3,the presenting of food,The new specification has much more emphasis on **the presenting of food**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing 'the presenting of food' is less concise and idiomatic than 'the presentation of food' or 'presenting food'.
2,4,expensive it makes sense,"The Specification does not specify how many portions have to be prepared or presented. As this task can be **expensive it makes sense** to cut down on portions, and serve individual dishes as opposed to larger ""family sized"" items.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma is required after an introductory dependent clause ('As this task can be expensive') when it precedes an independent clause.
3,4,family sized,"As this task can be expensive it makes sense to cut down on portions, and serve individual dishes as opposed to larger ""**family sized**"" items.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,The compound adjective 'family-sized' should be hyphenated when used before a noun in British English.
4,4,together,It DOES however specify a photograph in colour of each dish plus a photo of the completed three dishes and any accompaniments **together**,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The word 'together' is redundant as the phrase 'a photo of the completed three dishes and any accompaniments' already implies they are presented as a group.

It** would be very difficult for the moderator to agree the practical marks.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The phrase 'If this was the only photograph included in the work' is a dependent clause and should not be separated from the independent clause by a full stop. A comma should be used instead.
6,6,is chef,What about parents? Surely someone **is chef** who can spare an hour to do a dem with your Year 10?,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The indefinite article 'a' is missing before the noun 'chef'. It should be 'is a chef'.
7,7,that they can achieve,"We always work with the learners to get them the best mark **that they can achieve**. Many struggle with the written element, but excel at the practical, so you need to ensure that they get the best mark they can for this element.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrase 'that they can achieve' is redundant; 'they can achieve' is sufficient for conciseness.
8,8,also,Think garnishes and accompaniments. These not only look good but also add skills & techniques to the dishes which can **also** help increase marks.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The word 'also' is redundant given the preceding 'not only... but also' construction.

10,11,as a part of,Negatives: Would you serve a hard-boiled egg **as a part of** a side salad with a quiche? Not the best way to serve a side salad.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The more concise and commonly preferred phrasing in British English is 'as part of'.
11,11,also adding techniques,Positives: The dessert is well presented with thought to portion size and appropriate garnishing. Piped cream and the fruit coulis **also adding techniques**.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,This clause is a sentence fragment and lacks a main verb; it should be 'also add techniques' or 'are also adding techniques'.
12,12,table-cloth,"Remember – it doesn't need to be a **table-cloth**, you can use cardboard or sugar paper.",ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"In British English, 'tablecloth' is typically written as a single word (OED, Collins Dictionary)."
13,14,- Put,Not all learners will have access to serving dishes/plates **- Put** a message on your staff bulletin asking for help with serving dishes/cutlery/tablecloths.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"A hyphen/dash is incorrectly used to join two independent clauses; a full stop, semicolon, or conjunction with a comma is required."
