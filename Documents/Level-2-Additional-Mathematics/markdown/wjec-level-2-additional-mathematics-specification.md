INTRODUCTION

1.1  Aims

Level 2 Additional Mathematics supports learners to:
•  develop deeper thinking, reasoning, communication, application and

metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving
formulate and reinforce key mathematical skills

•
•  develop an understanding of new concepts and mathematical approaches and

the ability to apply them

•  be creative in applying mathematics to challenging problems and to novel and

•

abstract situations
reason mathematically, make deductions and inferences, draw conclusions and
engage with formal mathematical proof

•  develop an awareness of the holistic nature of mathematics
•  connect ideas within mathematics and between mathematics and other subjects.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales’ Approval Criteria.

1.2  Curriculum for Wales

This Level 2 Additional Mathematics qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum
for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to
make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification.
Central to this design are the principles of progression, along with the statements of
what matters and those subject specific skills and concepts outlined in the ‘Designing
your Curriculum’ section of the Mathematics and Numeracy Area of Learning and
Experience.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to
embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral
skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple
mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for
Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for
integrating the learning experiences noted on page 25; the Guidance for Teaching
will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

The Level 2 Additional Mathematics qualification builds on the conceptual
understanding learners have developed through their learning from 3-14, as well as
that from GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy. It supports the five interdependent
proficiencies that make up the Curriculum for Wales’ principles of progression for the
Mathematics and Numeracy Area, which are:
•
•
•
•
•

conceptual understanding
communication using symbols
fluency
logical reasoning
strategic competence.

LEVEL 2 ADDITIONAL MATHEMATICS 7

1.3  Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is
designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the
conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages
3–14 and by studying GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills
and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares
learners for life, learning and work.  The qualification provides a suitable foundation
for the study of Mathematics and other related subjects at either AS or A level. In
addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of
study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

1.4  Guided learning hours

Level 2 Additional Mathematics has been designed to be delivered within 60-90
guided learning hours. Each unit has been designed to delivered within 20-30 guided
learning hours.

1.5  Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our
language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect
and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and
adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising
that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to
ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres
of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always
be on the website.

1.6  Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic,
religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible,
features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access
and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual
orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to
enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills
without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the
following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access
Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This
document is available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of
provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete
barrier to any part of the assessment.

•

‘Learners should be aware of’ is used when learners need a general understanding of a
topic in order to access the unit. Learners will not be directly assessed on this content.
‘Learners should know’ is used when learners are required to demonstrate factual
knowledge.
‘Learners should understand’ is used when learners are required to demonstrate greater
depth of knowledge and understanding.
‘Learners should be able to’ is used when learners need to apply their knowledge and
understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills and
techniques.

The use of the word ‘including’ indicates that the specified content must be taught and could
be subject to assessment.

The use of the words ‘for example’ or ‘such as’ indicates that the specified content is for

variables, for a given context. This could include identifying the
appropriate objective function and stating whether it is to be
maximised or minimised, and formulating appropriate
inequalities for a given constraint.

All decision variables will be subject to non-negativity
constraints. Therefore, the feasibility region will be restricted to
the first quadrant.

Learners should be aware of the modelling cycle and how this
applies to linear programming problems in terms of moving from
the ‘real life problem’ to the associated ‘mathematical problem’
and the implication this has on the validity of the solutions.

Learners should be able to represent constraints and an
objective line graphically.

Learners should be able to use shading (to eliminate) and
identify the feasibility region for a set of given or derived
constraints.

Learners should be able to solve linear programming problems
involving two decision variables. Learners should use either the
objective line method or the vertex testing method, to find a
unique solution, including cases where integer solutions are
required. In such cases, the optimal solution will be found at a
point with integer coordinates.

Learners are not expected to have any knowledge of the simplex
algorithm for solving linear programming problems.

Algorithm List – Unit 6 Discrete and Decision Mathematics

Bubble sort

Start at the beginning of the working list and move from left to right comparing adjacent
items. If they are in order, leave them, if they are not, swap them.

When you get to the end of the working list, the last item will be in its final position. This item
is no longer in the working list.

If you made some swaps on the last pass, repeat the first instruction.

When a pass is completed without any swaps, every item is in its final position and the list is
in order, stop.

Quick sort

Choose the item at the midpoint of the list to be the first pivot. If the list has an even number
of items, the pivot should be to the right of the middle.

Write down all the items that are less than the pivot, keeping their order, in a sub list.
Write down the pivot.

Write down the remaining items (greater that the pivot, keeping their order) in a sub list.
Repeat for each sub list of size greater than one.

When all items have been chosen as pivots or any subgroups only contain one item, stop.

Dijkstra’s algorithm

Label the start vertex with a final label, 0.

Record a working value at each vertex that is connected to the vertex that has just received
its final label.

•  Working value is final label plus the weight of the edge.
If there is already a working value, it is only replaced if the new value is smaller.
•
•  Once a vertex has a final value, it is no longer revisited, and its working values are no

longer considered.

Look at the working values at all vertices without final labels. Select the smallest working
value. This now becomes the final label at that vertex. If two vertices have the same working
value, choose either of them first.

Repeat the second and third steps until the destination vertex receives its final label.

To find the shortest path, trace back from the destination to the start.

LEVEL 2 ADDITIONAL MATHEMATICS 33

Kruskal’s algorithm

Sort all the edges into ascending order of weight.

Select the edge of least weight to start the tree.

Consider the next edge of least weight. If it would form a cycle with those edges already
selected, reject it. If it does not form a cycle, add it to the tree. If there is a choice of equal
edges, choose one of them at random and consider each in turn.

Repeat the third step until all vertices are connected.

Prim’s algorithm

Choose any vertex to start the tree.

Select an edge of least weight that joins a vertex already in the tree to a vertex not yet in the
tree. If there is a choice of edges of equal weight, choose any of them.

Repeat the second step until all the vertices are connected.

4  MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's
regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in
the preparation of work for Level 2 Additional Mathematics.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our Guide to preventing, reporting and
investigating malpractice.

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC
(malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or
disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet Suspected
Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

5.1  Entries and Awards

This is a unitised qualification. Learners are entered for each unit separately.

Unit 1: Algebra will be available for the first time in January 2027. All other units will
be available for the first time in summer 2027. After the first January window, Unit 1:
Algebra, and Unit 2: Calculus will be available in every January and summer series.
The remaining four optional units will be available in every summer series. The
qualification will be awarded for the first time in summer 2027 and every January and
summer series thereafter.

Pre-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or under on 31st August in the
academic year in which they were entered)

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score
from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the
third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s).
This is referred to as a 'fresh start'. When retaking a qualification (fresh start), a
candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from
examination units taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating the new
grade(s).

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not
count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in
the final resit series.

Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1st September in the
academic year in which they are entered)

There is no limit on the number of times a candidate can resit an individual unit;
however, the better uniform mark score from the most two recent attempts will be
used in calculating the final overall grade.

The ‘fresh start’ rule does not apply to post-16 candidates.

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not
count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in
the final resit series.
