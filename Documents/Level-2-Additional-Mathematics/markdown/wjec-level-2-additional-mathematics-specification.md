This is a unitised qualification.

It is not tiered.

To be awarded the qualification, learners must complete three units:

- two mandatory units
- one optional unit.

Learners who complete fewer than three units will receive unit certification for the successful completion of each unit.

There is no hierarchy implied by the order in which the units are presented. Therefore, the order does not imply a prescribed teaching order.

The assessment for Unit 1: Algebra will be made available for the first time in January 2027, with the assessments for the remaining five units being available in the 2027 summer series.

After the first January window, Unit 1: Algebra, and Unit 2: Calculus will be available in every January and summer series. The remaining four optional units will be available in every summer series.

The qualification will be awarded for the first time in summer 2027.

## Level 2 Additional Mathematics

## 1 INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Aims

Level 2 Additional Mathematics supports learners to:

- develop deeper thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving
- formulate and reinforce key mathematical skills
- develop an understanding of new concepts and mathematical approaches and the ability to apply them
- be creative in applying mathematics to challenging problems and to novel and abstract situations
- reason mathematically, make deductions and inferences, draw conclusions and engage with formal mathematical proof
- develop an awareness of the holistic nature of mathematics
- connect ideas within mathematics and between mathematics and other subjects.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales' Approval Criteria.

## 1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This Level 2 Additional Mathematics qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the principles of progression, along with the statements of what matters and those subject specific skills and concepts outlined in the ' Designing your Curriculum ' section of the Mathematics and Numeracy Area of Learning and Experience.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted on page 25; the Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

The Level 2 Additional Mathematics qualification builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from 3-14, as well as that from GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy. It supports the five interdependent proficiencies that make up the Curriculum for Wales' principles of progression for the Mathematics and Numeracy Area, which are:

- conceptual understanding
- communication using symbols
- fluency
- logical reasoning
- strategic competence.



{8}------------------------------------------------



## 1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 -14 and by studying GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work.  The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of Mathematics and other related subjects at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

## 1.4 Guided learning hours

Level 2 Additional Mathematics has been designed to be delivered within 60-90 guided learning hours. Each unit has been designed to delivered within 20-30 guided learning hours.

## 1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

## 1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

## 2 SUBJECT CONTENT

## How to read the amplification

The amplification provided in the right-hand column uses the following four stems:

- 'Learners should be aware of' is used when learners need a general understanding of a topic in order to access the unit. Learners will not be directly assessed on this content.
- 'Learners should know' is used when learners are required to demonstrate factual knowledge.
- 'Learners should understand' is used when learners are required to demonstrate greater depth of knowledge and understanding.
- 'Learners should be able to' is used when learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques.

The use of the word ' including ' indicates that the specified content must be taught and could be subject to assessment.

The use of the words 'for example' or 'such as' indicates that the specified content is for guidance only, and alternative examples could be chosen.

| 6.3.1 Activity on arc networks, precedence tables and dummies | Learners should be able to form a precedence table for a given list of precedence statements. Learners should be able to model a project by constructing an activity on arc network from a precedence table. The use of a dummy activity is not included. Learners should know that dummy activities are placeholders and do not represent actual tasks, and, as such, do not take up time or resources. Learners should know that a dummy activity may be used for a given activity on arc network to: • ensure unique start and end nodes • show a required precedence. Learners are not expected to justify the use of a dummy, but they are expected to be able to solve problems on networks that make use of dummies. |
| 6.3.2 Critical paths                                          | Learners should be able to calculate: • early event times • late event times for a given activity on arc network, by performing a forward/backward pass. Dummies may be used to ensure unique start and end nodes, and/or to show precedencies. Learners should be able to calculate the total float for activities and identify critical activities and critical paths from an activity on arc network, by considering the early and late event times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 6.3.3 Gantt (cascade) charts                                  | Learners should be able to interpret Gantt (cascade) charts.

## Opportunities for integration of learning experiences

Level 2 Additional Mathematics generates opportunities for the following learning experiences to be developed (experiences will not be directly assessed):

- work both independently and collaboratively
- gain experience and appreciation of the role mathematics plays in other subjects and areas of the curriculum
- gain awareness and appreciation of some of the different careers and work-related areas that draw upon mathematics
- access rich tasks that invoke curiosity, build resilience and require Learners to be resourceful
- undertake practical work that allows Learners to apply their mathematical skills inside and outside of the classroom setting
- encounter familiar, unfamiliar and complex problems.

The Guidance for Teaching will include further information on the opportunities provided by the qualification for teachers/centres to integrate these learning experiences and skills into delivery.

For opportunities to develop cross-cutting themes, cross-curricular skills and integral skills please see Appendix A.

## 3.2 Organising, communicating and writing accurately

Two marks will be awarded on each examination paper for units 3, 4, 5 and 6 for the assessment of 'communicating, organising and writing accurately'. These marks will be in addition to the marks allocated to the mathematics. One mark will be awarded for communicating and organising. The other mark will be awarded for writing accurately. These questions will be clearly indicated on each examination paper.

For marks relating to organisation and communication, candidates will be expected to:

- present their response in a structured way
- explain to the reader what they are doing at each step of their response
- lay out their explanations and working in a clear and logical way
- write a conclusion that draws together their results and explains what their answer means.

For marks relating to writing accurately candidates will be expected to:

- show all their working
- use correct mathematical form in their working
- use appropriate terminology, units, etc.

## 3.3 Use of calculators

Calculators must meet the regulations set out below.

| Calculators must be: • of a size suitable for use on the desk • either battery or solar powered • free of lids, cases and covers which have printed instructions or formulas.   | During an examination, calculators must not • be able to offer any of these facilities: • language translators • symbolic algebra manipulation • symbolic differentiation or integration • communication with other machines or the internet. • give access to pre-stored information - this includes: • databanks • dictionaries • mathematical formulae • text. Calculators must not be borrowed from another candidate during an examination for any reason.*   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The candidate is responsible for the following: • the calculator's power supply • the calculator's working condition • clearing anything stored in the calculator.              | During an examination, calculators must not • be able to offer any of these facilities: • language translators • symbolic algebra manipulation • symbolic differentiation or integration • communication with other machines or the internet. • give access to pre-stored information - this includes: • databanks • dictionaries • mathematical formulae • text. Calculators must not be borrowed from another candidate during an examination for any reason.*   |

* An invigilator may give a candidate a replacement calculator.

## 3.4 Formula and algorithm lists

Units 1, 3, 4 and 5 will have a formula list at the beginning of the examination paper, and Unit 6 will have an algorithm list. The lists provided are as follows.

## Bubble sort

Start at the beginning of the working list and move from left to right comparing adjacent items. If they are in order, leave them, if they are not, swap them.

When you get to the end of the working list, the last item will be in its final position. This item is no longer in the working list.

If you made some swaps on the last pass, repeat the first instruction.

When a pass is completed without any swaps, every item is in its final position and the list is in order, stop.

## Quick sort

Choose the item at the midpoint of the list to be the first pivot. If the list has an even number of items, the pivot should be to the right of the middle.

Write down all the items that are less than the pivot, keeping their order, in a sub list. Write down the pivot.

Write down the remaining items (greater that the pivot, keeping their order) in a sub list. Repeat for each sub list of size greater than one.

When all items have been chosen as pivots or any subgroups only contain one item, stop.

## Dijkstra's algorithm

Label the start vertex with a final label, 0.

Record a working value at each vertex that is connected to the vertex that has just received its final label.

- Working value is final label plus the weight of the edge.
- If there is already a working value, it is only replaced if the new value is smaller.
- Once a vertex has a final value, it is no longer revisited, and its working values are no longer considered.

Look at the working values at all vertices without final labels. Select the smallest working value. This now becomes the final label at that vertex. If two vertices have the same working value, choose either of them first.

Repeat the second and third steps until the destination vertex receives its final label.

To find the shortest path, trace back from the destination to the start.

## Algorithm List -Unit 6 Discrete and Decision Mathematics



{34}------------------------------------------------



## Kruskal's algorithm

Sort all the edges into ascending order of weight.

Select the edge of least weight to start the tree.

Consider the next edge of least weight. If it would form a cycle with those edges already selected, reject it. If it does not form a cycle, add it to the tree. If there is a choice of equal edges, choose one of them at random and consider each in turn.

Repeat the third step until all vertices are connected.

## Prim's algorithm

Choose any vertex to start the tree.

Select an edge of least weight that joins a vertex already in the tree to a vertex not yet in the tree. If there is a choice of edges of equal weight, choose any of them.

Repeat the second step until all the vertices are connected.



{35}------------------------------------------------



## 4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for Level 2 Additional Mathematics.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our Guide to preventing, reporting and investigating malpractice.

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC (malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet Suspected Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.

## 5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

## 5.1 Entries and Awards

This is a unitised qualification. Learners are entered for each unit separately.

Unit 1: Algebra will be available for the first time in January 2027. All other units will be available for the first time in summer 2027. After the first January window, Unit 1: Algebra, and Unit 2: Calculus will be available in every January and summer series. The remaining four optional units will be available in every summer series. The qualification will be awarded for the first time in summer 2027 and every January and summer series thereafter.

## Pre-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or under on 31 st  August in the academic year in which they were entered)

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s). This is referred to as a 'fresh start'. When retaking a qualification (fresh start), a candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from examination units taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating the new grade(s).

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

## Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1 st  September in the academic year in which they are entered)

There is no limit on the number of times a candidate can resit an individual unit; however, the better uniform mark score from the most two recent attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade.

The 'fresh start' rule does not apply to post -16 candidates.

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.
