GCSE MATHEMATICS AND GCSE
MATHEMATICS-NUMERACY

PROFESSIONAL LEARNING (PL) TRAINING COURSES

Please note that, with our focus now on the new GCSE, there will be no online feedback event this
year. However, resources from previous years, which include valuable feedback on topic areas that
continue to present challenges for candidates, remain available on Portal.

PRINCIPAL EXAMINERS’ REPORTS

Principal Examiners’ reports are now available for the Summer 2025 series for GCSE Mathematics
and GCSE Mathematics-Numeracy. They can be found under the Key Documents tab on the legacy
GCSE Mathematics webpage.

FREE ACCESS TO SCRIPTS

WJEC teachers also benefit from access to free marked exam scripts from the Summer 2025 assess-
ment series.

Candidates’ scripts will be available to download from Portal from results day onwards.

BLENDED LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE ORGANISERS

We currently have two blended learning webpages running in parallel, one for the legacy qualifica-
tion and one for the new qualification. While some topics overlap, it is important to ensure that stu-
dents are directed to the correct resources page for the qualification they are following.

FINAL LEGACY EXAMINATIONS

In 2025–26, only candidates in Year 11 or above will be eligible to sit the legacy papers.

In 2026–27, resit opportunities will be available for post-16 learners who have previously cashed in on
the legacy qualification. These will be offered in November 2026 (GCSE Mathematics), January 2027
(GCSE Mathematics-Numeracy) and Summer 2027 (both GCSE Mathematics and GCSE Mathemat-
ics-Numeracy), subject to demand.

NEW GCSE MATHEMATICS AND NUMERACY
(DOUBLE AWARD)

PROFESSIONAL LEARNING (PL) TRAINING COURSES

We are pleased to announce that all professional learning activities within the WJEC support pack-
age for the new GCSE are now complete. During the spring term, we delivered 12 successful face-to-
face training days. Materials from these sessions are now available on Portal.

You will also find on Portal a set of student-facing examination walkthroughs, designed to help can-
didates prepare for assessments. These will not be publicly available initially, so teachers will need to
download and share them directly with their students.

Additionally, our new qualification webpage hosts further resources. Under Training  On Demand
Courses, you can access the Specification Walk-Through and a video recording of the Specification
Briefing held in November 2024.

Appendix 1

Following a consultation under the guidance of Canolfan Bedwyr, which is Bangor University's Cen-
tre for Welsh Language Services, Research and Technology (who are responsible for Y Termiadur
Addysg), a decision was made to change the Welsh language terminology currently in use for
'speed' and 'velocity'. An important point to make here is that Canolfan Bedwyr consulted with
WJEC, mathematics and physics subject specialists, the national literacy tests specialist panel and
teachers who currently teach these subjects in secondary schools.

The problem
The central issue with the current terminology is the inconsistency which exists between:

•  Language in common, everyday use:

The word 'cyflymder' is used for 'speed' outside school including in professional situations
(such as any discussion relating to speed limits etc). 'Buanedd' is an old historical term
which doesn't form part of everyday language.

•  Primary education:

Pupils learn the term 'cyflymder' for 'speed' in primary school.

•  Secondary education:

When they reach secondary school, pupils need to change to using 'buanedd' for 'speed'
without understanding why that is. Years later, the use of 'cyflymder' for 'velocity' is intro-
duced.

•  Educational subjects:

'Cyflymder' is used for 'speed' in subjects like Physical Education and Information Technol-
ogy but then 'cyflymder' is also used for 'velocity' in the subjects of Physics and Mathemat-
ics.

This inconsistency confuses pupils, especially as they move from primary to secondary education or
in resources or activities which encompass both periods. The recent national numeracy tests are
such an example, where a decision has to be made as to which term to use, with these tests being
given to primary and secondary pupils. This problem will continue despite the fact that changes will
be coming to these tests over the next few years.

The change

•  To use 'cyflymder' for 'speed' across all levels of education (reconciling with common speech)
•  Coin the new term 'felosedd' for 'velocity'
•  Dispose of the term 'buanedd' as a technical term

Arguments for change

•
•
•

It would reconcile terminology across primary and secondary education
It would reconcile school terminology with common speech
It would follow modern terminology principles (that is keeping familiar words for familiar con-
cepts)

Implementing the change

New GCSE/Level 2 specifications (teaching from 2025/2026)

Based on the recommendations of Canolfan Bedwyr therefore, 'cyflymder' (speed) and 'felosedd'
(velocity) will be used in the following new qualifications:

Level 2 Additional Mathematics specification - teaching from 2026

-  GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy (double award) specification - teaching from 2025
-
-  GCSE The Sciences (double award) - teaching from 2026
-  GCSE Integrated Science - teaching from 2026

In order to mitigate for any confusion which may be caused by this change, the English terms will be
put in brackets the first time the terms appear in an examination paper.

Current GCSE/Level 2 specifications

Please note: these changes relate to the new specifications only, there will be NO change to the
terms used in the current specifications.

'Buanedd' (speed) and 'cyflymder' (velocity) will continue to be used in the following specifications:

-  GCSE Mathematics/Numeracy specification (current)
-
-  GCSE Science specifications (Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Science Double Award, Applied

Level 2 Additional Mathematics specification (current)

Science Single Award/Double Award) (current)

From 2026 onwards, the terms in English will also be placed in brackets in the examination papers of
the above specifications. This is to avoid any confusion for the candidates sitting one of the current
GCSE Science specifications and the new GCSE Mathematics and Numeracy specification (teaching
from 2025).

Current GCE specifications

GCE Mathematics / Further Mathematics specifications

For now, 'buanedd' (speed) and 'cyflymder' (velocity) will continue to be used in these specifica-
tions.

However, the AS units of these specifications will be changed to align with the GCSE specification
from September 2027 onwards. Then from September 2028 onwards, the A Level units of these
specifications will also be changed. In fairness to all candidates sitting/resitting GCE Mathemat-
ics/Further Mathematics over the next few years, the English terms wil be placed in brackets in the
examination papers from 2026 onwards.

GCE Biology / Chemistry / Physics specifications

For now, 'buanedd' (speed) and 'cyflymder' (velocity) will continue to be used in these specifica-
tions.

However, the AS units of these specifications will be changed to align with the GCSE specification
from September 2028 onwards. Then from September 2029 onwards, the A Level units of these
specifications will also be changed. In fairness to all candidates sitting/resitting GCE Biology/Chem-
istry/Physics examination papers over the next few years, the English terms will be placed in brack-
ets in the examination papers from 2026 onwards.

Implementing these changes will cause an additional burden initially in the short term, but we do
feel that pupils will benefit from making this change in the long term in order to ensure con-
sistency of terminology across their entire educational journey.
