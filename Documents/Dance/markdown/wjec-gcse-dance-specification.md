**Unit 1: Choreography Non-examination assessment 40% of qualification Marked by centre and moderated by WJEC**

**96 marks**

### Summary of assessment

Response to a stimuli set by WJEC, assessed by the centre and moderated by WJEC. The stimuli will be available on the WJEC Portal during the September of the first year of study. The stimuli will be changed annually.

Learners will create, develop and refine a piece of choreography. Learners will also produce a Reflective Log of the process in a non-prescribed format. Learners can choose whether they perform in their own choreographed piece. Learners can choreograph a piece for a solo or a group of dancers (2-5 dancers).

**Unit 2: Performance Non-examination assessment 30% of qualification Marked by centre and moderated by WJEC**

**72 marks**

###### Summary of assessment

Learners will perform **two** pieces of repertoire. These pieces must be from different styles/genres. Learners will have choice and flexibility in the selection of their performance pieces for this unit, however learners must not perform an extract from the set works chosen by the centre for Unit 3. One performance must be a solo and the second performance can be solo or group (2-5 dancers).

**Unit 3: Dance Appreciation 30% of qualification Digital only examination 1 hour 45 minutes**

**72 marks**

###### Summary of assessment

Questions requiring objective responses, short and extended answers, in response to set works and unseen works.

{6}------------------------------------------------

This is a linear qualification.

The qualification is not tiered.

There is no hierarchy in the order in which the units are presented. The order does not imply the teaching order of the units.

Unit 1 and Unit 2 could be completed any time during the two years and submitted to WJEC in the final year of study. However, centres must ensure that assessment of both Unit 1 and Unit 2 is completed only when learners have undertaken the necessary teaching and learning and developed the required skills and knowledge. Unit 3 must be completed in the final year of study.

The first award of the qualification will be 2028.

Qualification Approval Number: C00/5167/3

# GCSE DANCE

<span id="page-6-0"></span>

## 1 INTRODUCTION

<span id="page-6-1"></span>

### 1.1 Aims

GCSE Dance supports learners to:

- explore dance created and performed by other people and develop their own talents in dance
- gain understanding of a range of forms, genres, styles, techniques, contexts and means of presenting dance, as well as the elements of dance
- develop knowledge, understanding and appreciation of how meaning is communicated through dance
- respond to and reflect on others' dance works, applying knowledge of context to evaluate the effectiveness of ideas and techniques used to communicate meaning
- develop physical, technical, and expressive skills to communicate choreographic intention and demonstrate control
- develop creative skills through experimenting and investigating choreography, in response to a broad range of stimuli, and purposefully communicate meaning
- reflect on, refine, and evaluate their own work
- explore the cross-cutting themes of human rights and diversity, including Black, Asian, and minority ethnic perspectives, identity, culture, and contributions.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales' Approval Criteria.

<span id="page-6-2"></span>

### 1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Dance qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of what](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/statements-of-what-matters/)  [matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/statements-of-what-matters/) and those [subject specific skills and concepts](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/designing-your-curriculum/#discipline-specific-considerations) outlined in the '[Designing your](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/designing-your-curriculum/)  [Curriculum'](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/designing-your-curriculum/) section of the Expressive Arts Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted on page 19; the Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery. 

{8}------------------------------------------------

The GCSE Dance qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:

- Supporting the statements of what matter[s](#page-7-2)<sup>1</sup> by giving learners the opportunity to:
  - explore their own creative work and other people's, to engage them with genres, techniques, tools, materials and practices and enable them to become curious and creative individuals.
  - explore their own cultural heritage and that of other people, places and times, and through this discover how dance can be used to shape and express personal, social and cultural identities
  - learn how the important skills of refinement and analysis can contribute to their creative development.
- Supporting the principles of progression[2](#page-7-3) by encouraging learners to:
  - explore, experience, interpret, create and respond through dance within a safe environment
  - evaluate their own and others' work
  - learn and refine different types of knowledge and skills including the techniques, processes and skills required to create and interpret
  - demonstrate more sophisticated use of relevant skills and the ability to transfer existing skills and knowledge into new contexts.
- Supporting the subject specific considerations for this area[3](#page-7-4) by giving learners the opportunity to:
  - explore, respond to stimuli and create and reflect on their own work while engaging in rich, authentic experiences
  - build understanding of performing, choreography and appreciation across a range of styles.

<span id="page-7-0"></span>

### 1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the further study of Dance. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

<span id="page-7-1"></span>

### 1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE Dance has been designed to be delivered within 120 – 140 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

{9}------------------------------------------------

<span id="page-8-0"></span>

### 1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

<span id="page-8-1"></span>

### 1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website [\(www.jcq.org.uk\)](http://www.jcq.org.uk/).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

# 2 SUBJECT CONTENT

<span id="page-9-1"></span>

## How to read the amplification

The amplification provided in the right-hand column uses the following four stems:

- 'Learners should know' is used when learners are required to demonstrate basic knowledge and understanding.
- 'Learners should understand' is used when learners are required to demonstrate greater depth of knowledge and understanding, application of knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and analysis and evaluation of information for a given purpose.
- 'Learners should be able to' is used when learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques.
- 'Learners are required to' is used to show the requirements of individual units.

The use of the word 'including' indicates that the specified content must be taught and could be subject to assessment.

The use of the words 'for example' indicates that the specified content is for guidance only, and alternative examples could be chosen.

<span id="page-9-2"></span>

### Unit 1

#### Choreography

Non-examination assessment 40% of qualification Marked by centre and moderated by WJEC 96 marks

###### Overview of unit

The purpose of this unit is to:

- develop an awareness of the choreographic process of creating dance
- develop learners' skills in self-evaluation, refinement and development of their own work
- develop a sense of choreographing for a specific purpose
- inspire learners to explore choreography from various styles/genres, periods/contexts and linked to different cultures in Wales and the world.

###### This unit will focus on:

- **exploring** learners will have the opportunity to explore choreographic processes, movement material, styles and techniques used by others to develop their own choreography skills in dance. Learners should have the opportunity to explore diversity, including different perspectives, identity, culture, and contributions that span Wales and the world.
- **creating** learners will create their own original dance in a style of their choosing. Learners will have the opportunity to develop creative skills through experimenting and investigating choreography. Learners will develop and refine their choreography using choreographic devices and structures to realise their artistic intentions.
- **responding and reflecting** learners will respond to a stimulus specified by WJEC and refine their work through reflection to create a finished product.

{11}------------------------------------------------

Learners will have choice in the selection of the stimulus set by WJEC and can choose whether they perform in their own choreographed piece. Learners will work independently to choreograph a piece for a solo dancer or a group of dancers (2-5 dancers). The performance time is as follows:

• Solo: 1 minute 30 seconds – 2 minutes • Group of 2-5 dancers: 2-4 minutes

###### Areas of content

#### 1.1 Choreography

In this unit learners will gain knowledge, skills and understanding of:

- 1.1.1 Creating and developing ideas to realise artistic intentions
- 1.1.2 Developing and refining movement material
- 1.1.3 Realising their choreography in a live performance
- 1.1.4 Reflecting on their own work

### Unit 2

###### Performance

Non-examination assessment 30% of qualification Marked by centre and moderated by WJEC 72 marks

###### Overview of unit

The purpose of this unit is to:

- inspire learners to explore a range of dance repertoire and provide opportunities to select pieces they wish to perform from various styles/genres, periods/contexts and linked to different cultures, perspectives and contributions in Wales and the world
- allow learners to develop their technical and performance skills by reflecting on their work in an ongoing cycle of practice and improvement
- provide opportunities for learners to perform individually and as part of a group, and develop the skills required to become proficient
- provide an opportunity for learners to develop personal skills of self-evaluation, resilience, determination and confidence.

###### This unit will focus on:

- **exploring** learners will have the opportunity to explore dance created and performed by other people and develop their own skills in dance.
- **creating**  learners will develop physical, technical, and expressive skills to interpret and communicate choreographic intention and demonstrate control.

Learners will perform **two** pieces of repertoire. The pieces must be choreographed by a professional practitioner. A professional practitioner can be a professional dancer, dance teacher or choreographer. These pieces must be from different styles/genres. Learners will have choice and flexibility in the selection of their performance pieces for this unit, however learners must not perform an extract from the set works for Unit 3. One performance **must** be a solo and the second performance can be solo **or** group. The performance time is as follows:

- Solo: 1 minute 30 seconds 2 minutes (the learner must actively perform in front of a live audience for a minimum of 1 minute 30 seconds).
- Group of 2-5 dancers: 2-4 minutes (when performing in a group, each dancer must actively perform for a minimum of 1 minute 30 seconds).

Please note, *actively performing* is being directly involved and contributing to the performance.

## 3.2 Overview of arrangements for non-examination assessment

###### Unit 1: Overview

For this assessment learners are required to: 

- create, develop and refine an original piece of choreography in response to a stimulus set by WJEC.
- produce a reflective log.

Learners will have choice in the selection of the stimulus set by WJEC and can choose whether they perform in their own choreographed piece. Learners can choreograph a piece for a solo or a group of dancers (2-5 dancers). The performance time is as follows:

- Solo: 1 minute 30 seconds 2 minutes
- Group of 2-5 dancers: 2-4 minutes

Learners may complete the assessment anytime during the course. However, centres **must** ensure that assessment is completed only when learners have undertaken the necessary teaching and learning and developed the required skills and knowledge.

The assessment contributes to 40% of the overall qualification. The unit will be marked out of total of 96 marks.

The stimuli will be released on the WJEC Portal during the September of the first year of study.

This unit will be assessed by the centre and externally moderated by WJEC.

###### Unit 2: Overview

For this assessment learners are required to: 

• perform **two** pieces of repertoire. These pieces **must** be from different styles/genres.

Learners will perform **two** pieces of repertoire. The pieces must be choreographed by a professional practitioner. A professional practitioner can be a professional dancer, dance teacher or choreographer. Learners will have choice and flexibility in the selection of their performance pieces for this unit, however learners must not perform an extract from the set works chosen by the centre for Unit 3. One performance must be a solo and the second performance can be solo or group. The performance time is as follows:

- Solo: 1 minute 30 seconds 2 minutes (the learner must actively perform in front of a live audience for a minimum of 1 minute 30 seconds.)
- Group of 2-5 dancers: 2-4 minutes (when performing in a group, each dancer must actively perform for a minimum of 1 minute 30 seconds).

{23}------------------------------------------------

Please note, *actively performing* is being directly involved and contributing to the performance.

Learners may complete the assessment anytime during the course. However, centres **must** ensure that assessment is completed only when learners have undertaken the necessary teaching and learning and developed the required skills and knowledge.

The assessment contributes to 30% of the overall qualification. The unit will be marked out of total of 72 marks.

This unit will be assessed by the centre and externally moderated by WJEC.

# 4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for GCSE Dance.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our [Guide to preventing, reporting and](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)  [investigating malpractice.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC (malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet [Suspected](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)  [Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)

# 5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

<span id="page-24-1"></span>

## 5.1 Making entries

This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the course. Non-examination assessed units can be completed earlier in the course but must be submitted at the end of the course.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series until the end of the life of this specification. Summer 2028 will be the first assessment opportunity.

A qualification may be taken more than once.

Marks for non-examination assessment (NEA) may be carried forward for the life of the specification. If a candidate resits an NEA unit (rather than carrying forward the previous NEA mark), it is the new mark that will count towards the overall grade, even if it is lower than a previous attempt (unless the mark is absent).

The entry codes appear below:

|                 | Entry code   |        |
|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| English medium  | Welsh medium |        |
| WJEC GCSE Dance | 3640QS       | 3640CS |

The current edition of our Entry Procedures and Coding Information gives up-to-date entry procedures.

# Appendix A: Choreographic devices, structural devices and choreographic structures

Please find below examples of choreographic structures, structural devices and choreographic structures. This is not an exhaustive list:

## Choreographic Devices

These are ways to manipulate movement material in developing motifs. A motif is a distinctive and recurring gesture or series of movements used to provide a theme or unifying idea. The following list includes examples of Choreographic Devices:

- change of **Background** to design a new way that the body presents a movement.
- change of **Facing** where a dancer faces when performing each action. e.g., Downstage, out to the audience, towards another dancer or a body part.
- change of **Force** the strength used to perform the action.
- change of **Intention** the meaning behind the movement.
- change of **Levels** where an action is performed low, middle, or high.
- change of **Planes** imaginary lines forming flat surfaces that intersect through the body; horizontal, vertical, and sagittal.
- change of **Quality** the description of movements e.g., sustained, percussive, suspended, swinging, quivery, fluid, jagged, collapsing.
- change of **Rhythm** a structure of movement patterns in time; a movement with a regular succession of strong and weak elements; the pattern produced by emphasis and duration of notes in music.
- change of the **Size** of the actions to condense or expand movements.
- change of **Staging**  where a dancer is on stage. e.g., up stage, down stage, stage left, stage right.
- change of **Time/Speed/Tempo** involves rhythm, phrasing, tempo, accent, and duration. Time can be metered as in music, or based on body rhythms such as breath, emotions, and heartbeat.
- use of **Accumulation** or combination, building movements by adding them together. E.g. performing movement 1 then 1 and 2 then 1, 2 and 3.
- use of **Amalgamation**  using 2 or more choreographic devices at once. Can also be a sequence of dance movements that use different styles, body actions and timings.
- use of **Fragmentation** using only part of a motif, isolating movements, or break down actions into a canon.
- use of **Incorporative** adding new or incorporating different or new movements into a motif or phrase.
- use of **Instrumentation** to perform a movement with a different body part. So, a circle with the arm could become a ronde de jambe or circle with the leg.
- use of **Inversion** movement performed laterally or upside down.
- use of **Ornamentation** adding embellishment to movements e.g., wiggle fingers, add loops or zigzags to pathways.
- use of **Repetition** duplication of a movement or movement's phrases within dance choreography.
- use of **Retrograde** to reverse the order of a sequence of dance choreography.

{27}------------------------------------------------

### Structural Devices

Structural Devices are how movements are shaped. The following list includes examples of Structural Devices:

- use of **Accumulation** adding movements and/or dancers into the action.
- use of **Canon** a passage, movement sequence or piece of music in which the parts are done in succession, overlapping one another. There are many types of 'canon' e.g. sequential canon, simultaneous canon, overlapping canon, accumulative canon.
- use of **Complementing**  to emphasize similarities; in dance, movements that have similar energy, or use of space (size, direction, level), or use of design (symmetrical and asymmetrical, open, and closed), or timing (fast and slow, even, and uneven), themes or patterns.
- use of **Contact work, giving weight and lifts**  counterbalances, manipulation of other dancers, giving, taking and supporting whole body weight.
- use of **Contrast** to emphasize differences; in dance, two movements that differ in energy, space (size, direction, level), design (symmetrical and asymmetrical, open, and closed), timing (fast and slow, even, and uneven), themes or patterns.
- use of **Counterpoint** where contrasting movements or themes are performed simultaneously by different dancers.
- use of **Formations**  where dancers are placed on stage in relation to each other. These can form patterns such as lines, curves, scattered and circles.
- use or **Mirroring** like unison but dancers use the opposite side of the body.
- use of **Pathways** a line along which a person or part of the person, such as an arm or head, moves e.g., her arm took a circular path, or he travelled along a zigzag pathway.
- use of **Phrasing** the way in which movements are grouped together, including the use of breath, pauses, and emphasis.
- use of **Transitions** how one movement, phrase, or section of a dance progresses into the next; a linking movement or idea.
- use of **Unison** identical dance movement that takes place at the same time in a group.

{28}------------------------------------------------

### Choreographic Structures

Choreographic structure is the way a dance piece is constructed or organised; a supporting framework or the essential parts of a dance also called compositional structure, dance structures or compositional form.

- **Binary** a dance composition consisting of two parts: AB.
- **Climax**  the climax is the highest point of a whole dance composition.
- **Collage** a compositional structure consisting of bits and pieces of assorted materials brought together to make a whole most daring moment, a key moment of unison, the moment of joy.
- **Cyclical Structure** where the choreography repeats in a cycle, often used in ritualistic or traditional dance forms.
- **Fugue** where phrases and sequences return overlayed, fragmented, and developed.
- **Narrative/Episodic**  where the dance tells a narrative or aspects unfold in episodes.
- **Suite** a series of linked but distinct dance sections, each with its own theme, style, or tempo, similar to musical suites.
- **Rondo** a dance piece in which a section is repeated throughout the dance; this is like a chorus in a song. e.g., ABACADA
- **Ternary**  a composition made of three parts e.g., ABA.
- **Theme and variation** a compositional structure characterised by a theme of clear movement sequences that are used as a basic structure for different variations. A1, A2, A3, A4.
