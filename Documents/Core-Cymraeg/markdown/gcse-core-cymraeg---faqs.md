GCSE Core Cymraeg & Level 2 Award in Additional Core Cymraeg Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How many hours are needed to teach the new course?
A: Guided Learning Hours (page 8 in specifications).

GCSE Core Cymraeg

Level 2 Award in Additional Core Cymraeg

120-140 guided learning hours

40-60 guided learning hours
20-30 guided learning hours per unit

Between 120-140 guided learning hours set out in the specification for the introduction and
teaching of the Core Welsh qualification. This number of hours is common to other
qualifications. 120 hours is set out in the current specification for GCSE Welsh Second
Language.

Then, between 40-60 guided learning hours specified in the Additional Core Cymraeg
specification and between 20 – 30 guided learning hours per unit.

Q: What is the difference between the tasks with Award Level 2 in Additional Core
Cymraeg and AS Welsh Second Language?

A:

This question refers to Unit 2 in the Level 2 Award in Additional Core Cymraeg and asks for
clarification how it differs from Unit 2 in the GCE qualification as Welsh Second Language.
The Additional Core Cymraeg has two tasks where three tasks are required in the AS. The
number of words is of course different. Both tasks in Additional Core Cymraeg have a low
level of control while one of the tasks in AS needs to be completed under special conditions.
With the Additional Core Cymraeg task 1 must be a critical response to research and
analysis and task 2 must be a creative and imaginative response written in the form of two
out of the nine writing forms listed in the specification. The response is not specified for the
AS tasks so three creative and imaginative tasks could be presented, three tasks critical and
factual in tone or a combination of both. The Additional Core Cymraeg title is a fully open
one – 'Cymraeg a fi’ (Welsh and I’) while the AS has listed specific titles to choose from for
putting together a package of work.

GCSE Core Cymraeg & Level 2 Award in Additional Core Cymraeg Frequently Asked Questions

Q: With the short stories/poems, do learners need to be able to mention characters,
poetry techniques etc?
A: Yes. At the bottom of page 20 of the specification for Core Cymraeg, the following is
stated:

‘Learners should understand different styles that enrich literature within the set texts,
including comparisons, idioms, use of adjectives, use of the senses, dialogue and verb
tenses.’

'Learners should understand different styles that enrich literature within the set texts' means
learners need to demonstrate their knowledge rather than apply it. 'Including' is indicated
here which means that the content must be learned and may be subject to assessment.
'Literature' in the paragraph refers to poems and short stories. All styles listed here should be
taught and presented in lessons, in the context of the four set pieces.

Q: What is the difference between the three themes? Can you advise how we should
approach this in a multicultural environment?
A: Page 6 of both specifications list how both qualifications support the Curriculum for
Wales:

1.2 Curriculum for Wales

The Curriculum for Wales framework underpins the GCSE Core
Welsh + Level 2 qualifications in Additional Core Cymraeg. It was
designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress
towards all four purposes whilst studying for these qualifications.
Central to this are the principles of progress, as well as the
statements of what is important, and those subject-specific skills
and concepts outlined in the 'Designing your Curriculum' part of
the Languages, Literacy and Communication Learning and
Experience Area.

Designing your curriculum

When selecting ‘Cross-cutting themes’ (in the red box as shown above) the information
about the cross-curricular themes will appear which actively explains the intention of
introducing these themes.

The three broad themes can be interpreted into our context as follows:

Being part of an area and a community is ‘habitat’.

‘Identity’ is what differentiates a person from everyone else and makes them different or
unique.

We celebrate the unique culture of our country in the theme, 'culture'
The three themes are intertwined.

The following sentence appears in the purpose of each unit in our two qualifications: ‘to
consider the diverse nature of Welsh citizenship and its cultures, including the perspectives,
identities, culture and contributions of Black, Asian and ethnic minority communities.’

Q: Can you advise how centres should timetable Award Level 2 in Additional Core
Cymraeg?
A: WJEC specifies in both specifications the number of guided learning hours. It will be the
centre's decision to select how many hours will be devoted to Welsh. Award Level 2 in
Additional Core Cymraeg is a further, optional qualification.

Q: Will candidates in schools in England be able to sit this qualification?
A: Yes.

Q: Why are Units 1 and 2 in GCSE Core Cymraeg (speaking and listening units) split
into two different school terms?
A: It was decided to split Unit 1 and Unit 2 into two different school terms to reduce the
administrative burden on centres.
