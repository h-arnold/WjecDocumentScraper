GCSE Core Cymraeg

1.

INTRODUCTION

1.1  Aims

GCSE Core Cymraeg must support learners to:
•  develop an understanding of the language
•  communicate clearly, accurately and creatively in Cymraeg
•  develop their knowledge and understanding of the vocabulary, grammar and

structure of Cymraeg

•  express themselves in a range of contexts and for different audiences and

purposes

•  contribute spontaneously to conversation/discussion

The qualification must be designed to promote a positive and relevant experience of
Cymraeg and Welsh cultures.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales’ Approval Criteria.

The construct of GCSE Core Cymraeg is based on the Welsh Government1 subject
specific considerations and statements of what matters for Languages, Literacy and
Communication2:
•  understanding the world around us
•  enjoyment of Cymraeg and seeing value for Cymraeg outside the classroom
•  using language associated with interests
•  developing the use of Cymraeg for socialising and the workplace
•  a wide variety of opportunities for learners to hear, view and read material which

is rich and diverse in Cymraeg

•  develop linguistic skills in order to use Cymraeg in a confident manner.

These aims are set out in the Qualification Wales Approval Criteria.

1.2  Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Core Cymraeg qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales
framework.  It was designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress
towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification.  Central to this design
are the principles of progression, along with the statements of what matters and
those subject specific skills and concepts outlined in the ‘Designing your Curriculum’
section of the Languages, Literacy and Communication Area of Learning and
Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to
embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral and
cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix B provides a simple mapping, and
information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

1  Languages, Literacy and Communication; Introduction – Hwb (gov.wales)
2 Languages, Literacy and Communication; Statements of what matters – Hwb (gov.wales)
© WJEC CBAC Ltd.2024

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for
integrating the learning experiences noted on page 21; the Guidance for Teaching
will include further information on integrating these learning experiences.

GCSE CORE CYMRAEG 8

The GCSE Core Cymraeg qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:
•

supporting the statements of what matters3, by giving learners the opportunity to:
develop their understanding, empathy and their ability to respond and to
•
mediate effectively
interact, explore ideas, express viewpoints, knowledge and understanding
and build relationships
experience and respond to a variety of diverse literature that gives them
insight into the culture, people and history of Wales as well as the wider world
spark their imagination and creativity.

•

•

•

•

•

supporting the principles of progression4 by giving learners the opportunity to:
•
•

build on their linguistic skills
grow holistically in their understanding and purposeful use of languages,
literacy and communication
develop their linguistic repertoire through understanding how Cymraeg works
adapt and manipulate language to communicate effectively to a range of
different audiences
develop interpretive and expressive language skills
transfer existing knowledge and skills into new contexts including the social
and cultural aspects of language.

•
•

•
•

supporting the key considerations for language development5 by giving learners
the opportunity to:
•
•

develop phonological awareness and phonemic awareness
build on learners’ previous knowledge of language(s) to support the learning
of Cymraeg
hear, view and read rich and varied Cymraeg
provide suitable and sufficient opportunities for learners to use their Cymraeg
purposefully in an authentic context.

•
•

1.3  Prior learning and progression

Although prior learning is not one of the specific requirements, the qualification is
primarily designed for learners aged between 14 and 16 in category 1 English
medium schools and learners who receive their education through the medium of
English in category 2 bilingual schools. Learners who have undertaken a Cymraeg
(first language) programme of study up to the end of year 9 should not be entered for
the qualification.  It therefore builds on the conceptual understanding developed by
learners through their learning from ages 3-14.

GCSE CORE CYMRAEG 9

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills
and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares
learners for life, learning and work.  The qualification provides a suitable foundation
for the study of Level 2 Award in Additional Core Cymraeg and at either AS or A
level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile
course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

1.4

Guided Learning Hours

GCSE Core Cymraeg has been designed to be delivered within 120 – 140 guided
learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year
programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

1.5

Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our
language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters
respect and accuracy. Language used should be as specific as possible. Staying
informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and
equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to
further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals.
WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the
specification will always be on the website.

1.6

Equality and fair access

This specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic,
religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible,
features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access
and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual
orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to
enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills
without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the
following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access
Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications.
This document is available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence
of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete
barrier to any part of the assessment.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

5.1   Making entries

GCSE CORE CYMRAEG 26

This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the
course. Non-examination assessed units can be completed earlier in the course but
must be submitted at the end of the course.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series until the end of the
life of this specification. Summer 2027 will be the first assessment opportunity.

A qualification may be taken more than once. Candidates must resit all examination
units in the same series.

Candidates who resit examination units can carry forward the marks they received for
non-examination assessed units from the first time they attempted the qualification.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be carried forward for the life of the
specification. If a candidate resits an NEA unit (rather than carrying forward the
previous NEA mark), it is the new mark that will count towards the overall grade,
even if it is lower than a previous attempt (unless the mark is absent).

The entry code appears below.
