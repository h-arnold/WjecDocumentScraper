200,75,algorithms does not,"Developers must ensure that software, especially **algorithms does not** have built -in biases that discriminate against certain groups based on race, gender, or other factors.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"Subject-verb agreement error: 'algorithms' is plural, so the verb should be 'do not'."
201,76,such as or IF,"They include a set of predefined keywords, **such as or IF**.",ErrorCategory.AMBIGUOUS_PHRASING,90,"The phrasing 'such as or IF' is unclear; it should specify if 'or' and 'IF' are distinct examples or if 'or IF' is a single example, e.g., 'such as 'OR' or 'IF''."
202,76,PRINT language specific,They follow specific grammar rules (syntax) that are **PRINT language specific**.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"This phrase is grammatically incomplete and unclear; it should likely be rephrased as 'language-specific, such as PRINT' or similar."
203,77,machine executable code,A compiler converts high -level languages into **machine executable code** in one go.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"As a compound adjective preceding a noun, 'machine-executable' should be hyphenated for clarity in British English."
204,77,outputted,"If there are mistakes, it will point them out, and an error message will be **outputted**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"In formal British English, 'output' is generally preferred as both the verb and noun; 'outputted' is considered informal or non-standard."
205,77,using optimisation,Some compilers can improve the code to make it run faster or use less memory **using optimisation**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"While not strictly incorrect, 'through optimisation' or 'by optimising it' would be more concise and flow better in formal writing."
206,78,", line by line","An interpreter is a type of tool used in computer programming that translates code written in a programming language into machine code **, line by line**. This means that instead of building a program all at once, the interpreter reads and executes the code one instruction at a time.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The comma before 'line by line' is grammatically incorrect as 'line by line' functions as an adverbial phrase modifying 'translates' and does not introduce an independent clause or a non-restrictive clause.
207,78,machine dependent,code is more portable as it is not **machine dependent** as it has not been translated to machine code.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,90,"When used as a compound adjective before a noun (or predicatively as here, describing a characteristic), 'machine-dependent' should be hyphenated in British English."
208,78,"line by line, running","- an interpreter translates code **line by line, running** interpreted code can be slower than running compiled code",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"This is a comma splice, joining two independent clauses ('an interpreter translates code line by line' and 'running interpreted code can be slower than running compiled code') with only a comma."
209,79,Principle stages,#### **Principle stages** of compilation process :,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,The word 'Principle' (a fundamental truth or belief) is incorrectly used; it should be 'Principal' (main or most important) in this context.
210,79,parsing which is analysing,- Syntax involves **parsing which is analysing** the sequence of tokens to identify the program's syntactic structure.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"The phrasing 'parsing which is analysing' is grammatically awkward and incorrect; it should be 'parsing, which involves analysing' or simply 'parsing, analysing' for better flow and grammatical structure."
211,79,definite assignment confirming,"- This phase conducts semantic checks, such as verifying data types and ensuring **definite assignment confirming** that all local variables are initialised before use.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"A comma is needed before the participle phrase 'confirming' to separate it from the preceding clause, clarifying that 'confirming' describes the action of 'ensuring definite assignment'."
212,79,resource intense,- Code optimisation may be employed to make it more efficient/faster/less **resource intense** .,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"The correct term for something that uses a lot of resources is 'resource-intensive', not 'resource intense'."
213,80,"development, these","There are various errors that can occur during the programming **development, these** are usually identified during testing or the compilation process.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"This is a comma splice, joining two independent clauses ('There are various errors that can occur during the programming development' and 'these are usually identified during testing or the compilation process') with only a comma."
214,80,to whole number,"Example: 34.9 truncated **to whole number** is 34, an error of –0.9.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,The indefinite article 'a' is missing before 'whole number'; it should be 'to a whole number' for grammatical correctness and consistency with the preceding sentence.
215,81,in truth table: AND,Learners should recognise the following logical operators **in truth table: AND**,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The singular 'truth table' is incorrect as multiple truth tables are presented; the 'AND' likely functions as a heading and should not be part of the sentence.
216,82,Boolean,- **Boolean** can be used for basic decision-making functions in early computers.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"For formal writing, 'Boolean logic' or 'Boolean algebra' is more precise than 'Boolean' when referring to the system or concept."
217,83,It,Operating systems (OS) are essential in making all computer systems work. **It** helps manage the hardware and software on devices.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The pronoun 'It' should be 'They' to agree with the plural subject 'Operating systems (OS)'.
218,83,it,It helps manage the hardware and software on devices. **it** provides a way for users to communicate with the computer.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The pronoun 'it' should be 'they' to agree with the plural subject 'Operating systems (OS)'.
219,83,It,"Resource Management makes sure that all components, like memory and processing power, are used efficiently. **It** also helps to protect your computer from unauthorised access.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The pronoun 'It' should be 'They' to agree with the plural subject 'Operating systems (OS)'.
220,83,like,"The OS handles this by time-slicing, switching between tasks making tasks seem to **like** they are running seamlessly.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The use of 'like' in this context is informal; 'as if' or 'to be' would be more appropriate for formal writing.
221,83,signal interrupts,"Interrupts: External devices, such as keyboard or mouse **signal interrupts** to the CPU.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'signal interrupts' is less common; 'send interrupts' or 'generate interrupts' would be more standard.
222,83,OS,"External devices, such as keyboard or mouse signal interrupts to the CPU. **OS** identifies the interrupt type and calls the corresponding interrupt handler.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The text inconsistently refers to the operating system as 'OS' without 'The' in this bullet point, whereas 'The OS' is used elsewhere."
223,83,CPU,OS identifies the interrupt type and calls the corresponding interrupt handler. **CPU** switches from the current task to the interrupt handler.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The text inconsistently refers to the CPU as 'CPU' without 'The' in this bullet point, whereas 'The CPU' is used elsewhere."
224,83,Handler,CPU switches from the current task to the interrupt handler. **Handler** executes required actions.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,The text inconsistently refers to the handler as 'Handler' without 'The' and with inconsistent capitalization; 'The handler' (lowercase 'h') would be consistent and grammatically correct.
225,83,CPU,Handler executes required actions. **CPU** restores saved task state and resumes previous execution.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The text inconsistently refers to the CPU as 'CPU' without 'The' in this bullet point, whereas 'The CPU' is used elsewhere."
226,83,the Memory: RAM,The OS manages the RAM by allocating space within **the Memory: RAM** to different applications and processes.,ErrorCategory.AMBIGUOUS_PHRASING,90,The phrasing 'the Memory: RAM' is redundant and awkward; it should be simplified to 'memory (RAM)' or 'RAM'.
227,83,"loading, saving and the organisation","Backing store: The OS manages the backing store by **loading, saving and the organisation** of data.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"The list lacks parallel structure; it should be 'loading, saving, and organising' for consistency with gerunds."
