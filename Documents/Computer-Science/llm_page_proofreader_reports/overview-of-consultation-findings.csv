19,10,around,Some concerns were raised **around** the number of non-examination assessments. We are unable to address this as it reflects a decision made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria state that there must be two non-examination assessments that account for 40% of the qualification.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'Around' is less formal than 'regarding' or 'about' in this context and could be replaced for a more professional tone.
20,10,As the Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC,"The Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC. Consequently, we have now decided that the fieldwork will be set and marked by WJEC. **As the Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC**, the Decision Making Exercise will now be marked by centres and moderated by WJEC; this non-examination assessment is 15% of the qualification and is therefore smaller than the fieldwork non-examination assessment at 25%.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,90,"This clause is repeated unnecessarily within the same sentence, making the phrasing redundant and clunky."
21,10,due to the time it takes,"However, following discussions with our Geography Qualification Development Advisory Group, we have not increased the weighting as we would consequently have to lower the fieldwork weighting; the Group did not favour this **due to the time it takes** learners to complete the fieldwork non-examination assessment.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing 'due to the time it takes' is slightly awkward; 'because of the time required for learners to complete' or similar would be more concise and formal.

26,12,was manageable,Respondents generally agreed or partially agreed that the proposed qualification structure and assessment approach is appropriate and that the proposed qualification **was manageable** for learners.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The verb tense should be consistent with 'is appropriate' as it refers to the current proposed qualification.

28,12,and on non-religious,This was not the intention – the qualification will place equal value on religious **and on non-religious** beliefs and philosophical convictions.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The preposition 'on' is redundant before 'non-religious beliefs' as it is already covered by 'place equal value on religious'.

37,15,states,We are unable to address these points as they reflect decisions made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria **states** that 50% of the qualification will be assessed through nonexamination assessment and marked by the centre.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"'Criteria' is a plural noun, so the verb should be 'state', as correctly used later in the document, indicating an inconsistency."

41,16,Single and Double award,"Some respondents were not in agreement with the combined Language and Literature approach, the organisation into **Single and Double award**, or the reduction to two assessment objectives.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,'Award' should be capitalised for consistency with 'Single Award' and 'Double Award' used elsewhere in the document.
42,17,not one unit,"As a direct result of this feedback, we have redesigned some of the units so that **not one unit** focuses solely on oracy.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,'No unit' or 'no single unit' would be more natural and concise phrasing in British English.
43,17,students,"We have therefore decided to move poetry to an examined unit in the Single Award, where **students** will respond in writing.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,"The document consistently uses 'learners' to refer to those undertaking the qualification, making 'students' an inconsistency."
44,17,double award unit,Assessments based on poetry feature once in the common units and once in a discrete **double award unit**.,ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,'Double Award' should be capitalised for consistency with other instances of 'Single Award' and 'Double Award' in the document.
