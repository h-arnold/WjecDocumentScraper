BRIEF:

PRE-RELEASE MATERIAL

Pentre Bach Pre-School (PBPS)

Original Requirements

Pentre Bach Pre-School (PBPS) serves the village of Parkwood Vale in South Wales and
has the capacity to care for up to 150 pupils.

PBPS currently stores details about staff and pupils using a paper-based system. Its office
manager would like to begin storing data on a computerised system. Whilst the pre-school
could buy an off-the-shelf package, he has decided to develop a bespoke solution and has
requested your expertise in planning and developing this system.

Main Menu and Navigation

Most of PBPS’s staff are non-specialist computer users. They have requested that the
system be user friendly and therefore, require you to develop a Graphical User Interface
(GUI) for intuitive navigation.

PBPS has stated that they require a main menu containing options that allow users to carry
out tasks in separate windows. It must also provide access to a window for adding new
usernames and passwords.

Authentication

Data security is an essential legal requirement. The system must have a login screen that
requires a username and a password for authentication of multiple users to access its
system. The system must display a message stating whether login was successful or
unsuccessful and only allow access to the main menu if the login is successful.

Adding Staff

PBPS requires the following staff details to be stored:

•  Staff ID
•  First name
•  Surname
•  Address 1
•  Address 2
•  Postcode.

The GUI window should also include buttons that:

•  save the staff details to a file called StaffDetails.txt
•

return to the main menu.

Below, PBPS has provided an initial design of the GUI window they would like developed:

Payroll

PBPS pays staff for the hours worked and requires accurate calculations of the amount of
pay for each staff member.

Users will enter the monthly salary (gross pay) and the system will calculate and display
deductions, and the correct amount of take-home pay (net pay).

The following calculations should be used for the prototype software:

Tax

19% of gross pay

National insurance

8.5% of gross pay

Pension contribution  10% of gross pay

Deductions

tax + national insurance + pension contribution

Net pay

gross pay – deductions

An initial design for the GUI window has been provided:

PBPS would like the system developed using the Python programming language.
