## BRIEF:

## Original Requirements

Pentre Bach Pre-School (PBPS) serves the village of Parkwood Vale in South Wales and has the capacity to care for up to 150 pupils.

PBPS currently stores details about staff and pupils using a paper-based system. Its office manager would like to begin storing data on a computerised system. Whilst the pre-school could buy an off-the-shelf package, he has decided to develop a bespoke solution and has requested your expertise in planning and developing this system.

## Main Menu and Navigation

Most of PBPS's staff are non-specialist computer users. They have requested that the system be user friendly and therefore, require you to develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for intuitive navigation.

PBPS has stated that they require a main menu containing options that allow users to carry out tasks in separate windows. It must also provide access to a window for adding new usernames and passwords.

## Authentication

Data security is an essential legal requirement. The system must have a login screen that requires a username and a password for authentication of multiple users to access its system. The system must display a message stating whether login was successful or unsuccessful and only allow access to the main menu if the login is successful.

## Adding Staff

PBPS requires the following staff details to be stored:

- Staff ID
- First name
- Surname
- Address 1
- Address 2
- Postcode.

The GUI window should also include buttons that:

- save the staff details to a file called StaffDetails.txt
- return to the main menu.

Below, PBPS has provided an initial design of the GUI window they would like developed:

## Payroll

PBPS pays staff for the hours worked and requires accurate calculations of the amount of pay for each staff member.

Users will enter the monthly salary (gross pay) and the system will calculate and display deductions, and the correct amount of take-home pay (net pay).

The following calculations should be used for the prototype software:

| Tax                  | 19% of gross pay                                |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| National insurance   | 8.5% of gross pay                               |
| Pension contribution | 10% of gross pay                                |
| Deductions           | tax + national insurance + pension contribution |
| Net pay              | gross pay - deductions                          |

An initial design for the GUI window has been provided:

PBPS would like the system developed using the Python programming language.
