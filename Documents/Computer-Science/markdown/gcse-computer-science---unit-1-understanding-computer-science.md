MARK SCHEME

Guidance for examiners

Generic marking principles

•  Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).

•  Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar

when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark
scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.

•  Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for
the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the
quality of the candidate responses seen).

•  Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme.
Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

Positive marking

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit
should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of
penalising him/her for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to
achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be
deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied
precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates’ answers. The list is not
exhaustive. The inclusion of ‘Credit any other valid response.’ (or similar instruction) within
mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates’ responses. Credit should be
given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates’ answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However,
unless there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks
where the answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

how an operating system manages interrupts.

A developed description could include one of the
following:

•  External devices, like keyboards or printers,
signal interrupts to the CPU to indicate they
need attention.

•  The OS identifies the type of interrupt and calls
the corresponding interrupt handler, a special
routine designed to handle that specific
interrupt.

•  The CPU switches from the current task to the
interrupt handler, pausing its current work.
•  The current task state, including its registers

and program counter, is saved so the task can
resume later without losing progress.

uses priority scheduling to make sure important
tasks get more CPU time or are executed
before lower-priority tasks.

•  The OS manages system resources, to support
the concurrent execution of tasks. This involves
allocating memory to tasks, handling input and
output operations so tasks do not interfere with
each other.
