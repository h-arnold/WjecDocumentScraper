# Aims of the Delivery Guide

The aim of the Delivery Guide is to give an overview of the qualification and to help teachers understand how we assess the GCSE. It will offer an introduction to the specification, an assessment overview, and will support teachers in better understanding how to prepare their learners for the assessment of the different units. More information on each unit can be found in the separate unit guides.

<span id="page-3-1"></span>

# Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE Computer Science consists of two units:

| Unit title | Type of Assessment             | Weighting                                              |     |
|------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| Unit 1     | Understanding Computer Science | Digital examination                                    | 50% |
| Unit 2     | Computer Programming           | On-screen examination<br>based on a pre-released brief | 50% |

All units are compulsory.

{5}------------------------------------------------

<span id="page-4-0"></span>

## Unit 1

The purpose of this unit is to:

- introduce learners to the key concepts and computational processes to be explored throughout the course
- consider the broad legal, social, ethical, environmental and professional consequences relevant to the use of technology
- consider the evolution of technologies that are relevant to the topics.

## The unit will be based on the following:

- computer architecture:
  - components
  - peripheral devices
  - storage
- structure of systems and functions:
  - data types, including representation, storage and compression
  - data and file structures
  - automated systems
- how systems communicate:
  - networks and infrastructure
  - cybersecurity and personal privacy
- algorithms
- software:
  - principles of programming
  - software development, including the software development lifecycle (SDLC)
  - program construction
- logical operations
- operating systems
- systems development lifecycle.

Legal, social, ethical, environmental and professional dimensions and reference to the evolution of technologies will be integrated where appropriate into the above topics.

{6}------------------------------------------------

<span id="page-5-0"></span>

## Unit 2

The purpose of this unit is to:

- explore the concept of programming
- develop programming skills using Python as the specified language
- encourage iterative problem solving and design
- develop the use of data modelling skills
- give learners the opportunity to build appropriate user interfaces.

The unit will be based on the following:

- investigation
  - decomposition
  - abstraction
  - pattern recognition
- design
  - algorithms
  - data modelling
- implementation
  - programming
  - user interfaces
- testing
- refinement, including evaluation.

Learners will require access to Python 3. The version of Python 3 required will be specified on the scenario issued to candidates and on the examination instructions.

The materials will be released, written using the standard Python IDLE IDE and will use TKINTER library for graphical user elements.

Centres may use an IDE of their choice for teaching programming knowledge and skills. However, learners are required to use the Python IDLE IDE version specified in the prerelease for the Unit 2 examination.

# Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:

- Specification this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to know by the end of their course.
- Assessment Pack this contains the Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) i.e.: sample exam papers and sample NEA tasks, relevant controls for the NEA and, mark schemes This guide builds upon the information in the specification and assessment pack to help further your understanding of said documents.

<span id="page-7-1"></span>

# Understanding the specification amplification

Learners should be made aware of:

- the specification stems
- what the specification stems mean.

<span id="page-7-2"></span>

# Specification Stems

When you look through the specification you will notice in the amplification column, we use a variety of wording before the list of content learners need to know; we call this a stem:

![](_page_7_Figure_11.jpeg)

Each stem is used for a slightly different reason:

| Specification Stem          | When it is used                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Learners should know        | When learners are required to use direct recall.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Learners should be aware of | When learners do not need to understand all aspects of the specified content in detail. Teachers should refer to Guidance for Teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and breadth to which this content should be taught.    |
| Learners should understand  | When learners are required to demonstrate greater depth than straight identification or recall. For example, they can apply knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and can synthesise and evaluate information for a given purpose. |
| Learners should be able to  | When learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques.                                                                                     |

## Command words

Learners should be made aware of:

- what command words are
- what each command word means
- what each command word assesses.

Command words are the words and phrases used in assessments that tell learners how they should answer the question or complete the task. Command words direct the learner through the question or task and indicate the nature of the response required.

![](_page_8_Picture_7.jpeg)

The following tables are not exhaustive but will give you a good idea of the command words we typically use:

| Command words for direct recall                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

# Mark Schemes

Mark schemes and/or assessment criteria test the intended learning outcomes for a component. They describe the knowledge and skills (and possibly attitude) that a candidate is expected to demonstrate in their responses, and they are then used in marking the work.

## Objective based mark scheme:

For very short answer questions requiring one correct response.

| Question | Answer | AO1                                                   | AO2 | AO3 | Total Mark |

|          |        | Award one mark for the following:                     | 1   |     | 1          |
