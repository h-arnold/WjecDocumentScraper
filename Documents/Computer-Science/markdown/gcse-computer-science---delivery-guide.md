Aims of the Delivery Guide

The aim of the Delivery Guide is to give an overview of the qualification and to help teachers
understand how we assess the GCSE. It will offer an introduction to the specification, an
assessment overview, and will support teachers in better understanding how to prepare their
learners for the assessment of the different units. More information on each unit can be
found in the separate unit guides.

Unit 1

The purpose of this unit is to:
•

introduce learners to the key concepts and computational processes to be explored
throughout the course

•  consider the broad legal, social, ethical, environmental and professional consequences

relevant to the use of technology

•  consider the evolution of technologies that are relevant to the topics.

The unit will be based on the following:
•  computer architecture:

•  components
•  peripheral devices
•  storage

•  structure of systems and functions:

•  data types, including representation, storage and compression
•  data and file structures
•  automated systems
•  how systems communicate:

•  networks and infrastructure
•  cybersecurity and personal privacy

•  algorithms
•  software:

•  principles of programming
•  software development, including the software development lifecycle (SDLC)
•  program construction
•
logical operations
•  operating systems
•  systems development lifecycle.

Legal, social, ethical, environmental and professional dimensions and reference to the
evolution of technologies will be integrated where appropriate into the above topics.

Delivery Guide GCSE Computer Science 3

Unit 2

The purpose of this unit is to:
•  explore the concept of programming
•  develop programming skills using Python as the specified language
•  encourage iterative problem solving and design
•  develop the use of data modelling skills
•  give learners the opportunity to build appropriate user interfaces.

The unit will be based on the following:
•

investigation
•  decomposition
•  abstraction
•  pattern recognition

•  design

•  algorithms
•  data modelling
implementation
•  programming
•  user interfaces
testing
refinement, including evaluation.

•

•
•

Learners will require access to Python 3. The version of Python 3 required will be specified
on the scenario issued to candidates and on the examination instructions.

The materials will be released, written using the standard Python IDLE IDE and will use
TKINTER library for graphical user elements.

Centres may use an IDE of their choice for teaching programming knowledge and skills.
However, learners are required to use the Python IDLE IDE version specified in the pre-
release for the Unit 2 examination.

Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:
•  Specification – this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to

know by the end of their course.

•  Assessment Pack – this contains the Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) i.e.: sample
exam papers and sample NEA tasks, relevant controls for the NEA and, mark schemes

This guide builds upon the information in the specification and assessment pack to help
further your understanding of said documents.

Understanding the specification amplification

Learners should be made aware of:
•
•  what the specification stems mean.

the specification stems

Specification Stems

When you look through the specification you will notice in the amplification column, we use a
variety of wording before the list of content learners need to know; we call this a stem:

Specification Stem

Learners should:

Amplification

•  understand the broader perspective of the

development of entire systems, which may include
software, hardware, people, processes and data

•  be aware of professional considerations related to

industry standards for software development

Each stem is used for a slightly different reason:

When it is used

Learners should
know

Learners should be
aware of

Learners should

When learners are required to use direct recall.

When learners do not need to understand all aspects of the
specified content in detail. Teachers should refer to Guidance
for Teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and
breadth to which this content should be taught.

When learners are required to demonstrate greater depth than
straight identification or recall. For example, they can apply
knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and can synthesise
and evaluate information for a given purpose.

Learners should be
able to

When learners need to apply their knowledge and
understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application
of practical skills and techniques.

Command words

Learners should be made aware of:
•  what command words are
•  what each command word means
•  what each command word assesses.

Command words are the words and phrases used in assessments that tell learners how they
should answer the question or complete the task. Command words direct the learner through
the question or task and indicate the nature of the response required.

3. (c)

Identify how many unique values can be represented by 4 bits in
binary.

we typically use:

5-6 marks

The candidate has:
•  shown strong understanding of the requirements of the question and a clear

3

knowledge of the indicative content. Clear knowledge is defined as a response
that provides five to six relevant detailed points from the indicative content
•  shown a sustained line of reasoning which is coherent, relevant, substantiated

and logically structured

•  used appropriate computer science terminology.

3-4 marks

The candidate has:
•  shown some understanding of the requirements of the question and sound

2

knowledge of the indicative content. Sound knowledge is defined as a response
that provides three to four relevant detailed points from the indicative content
•  shown a line of reasoning which is partially coherent, largely relevant, supported

by some evidence and with some structure

•  used mainly appropriate computer science terminology.

1-2 marks

The candidate has:
•  shown limited understanding of the requirements of the question and superficial
knowledge of the indicative content. Superficial knowledge is defined as a
response that provides one to two relevant points from the indicative content
•  shown a basic line of reasoning which is not coherent, largely irrelevant with very

little structure

•  used limited computer science terminology.

No attempt made or no response worthy of credit.
