Addition of the online Sample Assessment Administration
Materials link.

The online Sample Assessment Materials link updated.

Appendix A - Removal of reference to duration bar on the on-
screen assessment in response to recommendation 22 in the
RF, where we provided our rationale for removing the timer.
Therefore, this information was not relevant.

Appendix B - The current On-Screen Assessment –
Information to Centres document, on which we based
Appendix B of the Unit 2 SAMs, did not account for some
differences introduced in the new GCSE Computer Science
regarding administration for learners and centres. This was an
oversight that, we identified when Qualifications Wales
flagged contradictory wording on page 19 of the Unit 2 SAMs.

MARK SCHEME

Guidance for examiners

Generic marking principles

•  Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).

•  Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar

when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark
scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.

•  Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for
the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the
quality of the candidate responses seen).

•  Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme.
Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

Positive marking

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit
should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of
penalising candidates for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to
achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be
deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied
precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates’ answers. The list is not
exhaustive. The inclusion of ‘Credit any other valid response.’ (or similar instruction) within
mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates’ responses. Credit should be
given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates’ answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However,
unless there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks
where the answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

Banded mark schemes

For band marked questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the
assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in
candidates’ answers. It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate’s response. As
noted above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive, and candidates do not have
to include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the
requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it
contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been
provided, no marks should be awarded.

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each
candidate’s response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills,
knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors
or omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate’s answer to pick out the evidence
that is being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied. This is done
as a two-stage process.

Stage 1 – Deciding on the band

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate’s answer and check
whether it matches the descriptors for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are
satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band
until the descriptors most closely matches the work.

Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark

Having determined the appropriate band, deciding on the mark within a band will be made
on the basis of a ‘best fit’ procedure, weaknesses in some areas being compensated for by
strengths in others.

Examiners should use the full range of marks available to them. Marking should be positive,
rewarding achievement rather that penalising failure or omissions. The awarding of marks
must be directly related to the marking criteria, and all responses must be marked according
to the banded levels provided for each question.

Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be provided during
standardising and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work.
Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the standardising material as they apply the
mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the
work submitted.

This mark scheme instructs examiners to look for and reward valid alternatives where
indicative content is suggested for an answer. This is not a checklist for expected content in
an answer, or set out as a 'model answer', as responses must be marked in the banded
levels of response provided for each question. Where a candidate provides a response that
contains aspects or approaches not included in the indicative content, examiners should use
their professional judgement to determine the validity of the response in light of the task and
reward as directed by the bands. Candidates are free to choose any approach that is
relevant to the set task. Candidates can (and will most likely) incorporate ideas other than
those mentioned in the mark scheme.

When starting the development, PBPS set requirements for the initial system. An example of
some of the requirements are below:

•  GUI windows must have a title set to identify the purpose of the window.
•  All windows must have a button to allow for navigation.
•  Some text needs to be returned as 50 characters, left justified text strings.
•  When required, error messages are to be displayed.

The original programmer did not annotate the code. As a result, the code is not well
documented.

Find the relevant sections of code in the PBPS.py file. Save the file once answers have been
completed.

Annotate one example found in the PBPS.py file of each of the following:

A maximum of two marks for a developed description of
an outcome.

A developed description could include one of the
following:

Typical test data
The data has passed the test because the data entered is
in lowercase and meets the expected format for typical
data. The system is designed to accept the username and
password in the correct case.

Extreme test data
For the extreme data test, the username was made
excessively long. The system should have a maximum
limit for the username length, and as expected, the login
failed. This confirms that the system correctly enforces
length restrictions for usernames.

Erroneous test data
An incorrect password was entered. The system identified
the incorrect password and denied access. This shows
that the system properly validates the password before
granting access.

Credit any other valid response.

(c)  Award one mark for the each of the following:
•  Code added to the correct location
•  use of string manipulation e.g. upper/lower
•  annotation of code.

Appendix A - WJEC Computer Science Digital Assessment -
Information for centres

For use with SAM only – will be removed from live Candidate Packs.

The following information relates to Unit 1: Understanding Computer Science and Unit 2:
Computer Programming

1.  Arrangements and access of the digital examination:

Digital examinations will be delivered to centres through Surpass software. An
application named WJEC SecureClient will need to be installed on candidate’s PC within
centres so that candidates can complete the exams. The Surpass software will be
available throughout the academic year and centres will be encouraged to complete
practice exams (e.g. Digital Specimen Assessment Materials and past papers as they
become available) using the on-screen assessment software so that candidates can
familiarise themselves with the software in readiness for the live exams.

2.  Controls within digital examination:

Centre staff will need to:
•  ensure invigilators can log into Surpass to be able to pause and resume exams

during the delivery of on-screen exams. Used for candidates who have supervised
rest breaks (access arrangements) and for individual or cohort issues that may occur
during live exams e.g. disruption.

Candidates will have the ability to:
•  change the colour preferences of the on-screen exam
•  zoom in/out functionality.

3.  Candidate instructions for digital examinations:

Centres will be provided with a Candidate User Guide for candidates completing on-
screen assessments. The Surpass software will be available throughout the academic
year and centres will be encouraged to complete practice exams (e.g. Digital Specimen
Assessment Materials and past papers as they become available) using the on-screen
assessment software so that candidates can familiarise themselves with the software in
readiness for the live exams.

4.  Digital examination arrangements – clarity over support:

Live exams will be scheduled by WJEC at least 7 days before the date of the exam. The
‘Home’ screen of Surpass will contain information to assist with the installation and
testing of the software as well as a user guide detailing the administration process of
delivering on-screen exams within a centre.

Appendix B - WJEC Computer Science On-Screen
Assessments - Information for centres

The following information relates to Unit 2: Computer Programming

Each Candidate will need:

•  7-Zip pre-installed and accessible

•  This is free to download from https://www.7-zip.org
•  Alternatives for Apple users are available here: 7-Zip Alternatives for Mac
•  WJEC is unable to support centres that do not use the 7-zip program.

Centres using a solution for Apple computers are strongly advised to test their
systems comprehensively prior to the examination.
•  The encrypted media files pre-downloaded  and available  .
•  A restricted digital assessment environment which only permits access to the required
encrypted media files, necessaryapplications or designated storage device (if required)
for saving work.

NB: Without compromising the functioning of the workstation, candidates must not have
access to the Internet, any shared drives, Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) or email
during the examination.

•  A pre-installed functional copy of Python version 3 matching the version specified on

the pre-released brief.

Network Managers/Technicians

Encrypted media files
•  Encrypted media files will be available on the Surpass system 2 weeks prior to the

examination.
•  An administrative keycode will also be available on the Surpass system. This will

enable centres to download the encrypted media files and distribute them for each
candidate undertaking the examination.

•  The files will need to be downloaded and distributed before the examination.

•  Further details are available in the  ‘Guidance on Surpass for Examinations Officers’

document on the public website under the ‘Key documents’ and ‘On Screen
Assessment’ Sub-heading:
•  WJEC GCSE: LINK Welsh version: LINK

•  As the examination is reliant upon candidates accessing and using the media files WJEC
will be contacting those centres who have not downloaded the encrypted media files.
•  Candidate keycodes, which will need to be used to upload each candidate ’s examination
work after the examination has ended, will be available for  Examinations Officers to
download via Surpass.

The following additional documentation will be available on the home tab of the Surpass
system, available to centre staff:
•  e-Assessment Live Exams Guide
•  e-Assessment Candidate User Guide

In addition to the invigilator(s), a technician* or other suitably qualified person may be in
attendance throughout the examination to help with issues related to the functioning of
equipment. This person is not an invigilator and must not count as one when determining
the number of invigilators required to conduct the examination.

*The computer science teacher may undertake this role.

The Examination Room and its Layout
•  The exam must be carried out under formal supervision, i.e. the candidates must be in

direct sight of the invigilator at all times.

•  The decryption password required for the unzipping of the media files is found on

the candidate introduction page in Surpass.

•  Copies of instructions for the decryption of zip files should also be available for pupils.
•  Use of resources is tightly prescribed and interaction with other candidates and the

Internet or any other digital resource is forbidden.

•  The JCQ  “Instructions for conducting examinations” must be adhered to.

Uploading of Candidate’s Work
•  Candidates will be required to upload their program response files to the Surpass system
before completing the examination. Candidates can be supported in this process.

Retaining a Copy of Each Candidate’s Work
•  Each centre must keep an electronic copy of each candidate’s work in a secure location

in case of loss or damage to the original submission.

Prior to the Examination:
•  Ensure all candidates are aware they will be required to decrypt files during the

examination.

•  Centres will be sent a communication document to share with candidates on how to

decrypt files, the format this document is shared is down to the discretion of the centre
i.e. digitally or hard copy.

•  An example communication document can be found here
•

It is recommended that centres practice this process with candidate prior to the
examination.

Before the Examination:
•  Ensure that all candidates have logged on and have access to the examination.
•  Once all candidates have logged on, they should decrypt their files.
•  Candidates can be supported in this process
•  Once all candidates have decrypted their media files the examination can start.
•  Start the examination: Please note that invigilators are responsible for the timekeeping of
the examination. The start time and the end time of the examination should be displayed
in the normal way.
