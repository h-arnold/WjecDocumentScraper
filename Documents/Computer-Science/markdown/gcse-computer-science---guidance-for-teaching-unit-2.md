- develop the use of data modelling skills
- give learners the opportunity to build appropriate user interfaces.

The unit will be based on the following:

- investigation
  - decomposition
  - abstraction
  - pattern recognition
- design
  - algorithms
  - data modelling
- implementation
  - programming
  - user interfaces
- testing
- refinement, including evaluation.

Learners will require access to Python 3. The version of Python 3 required will be specified on the scenario issued to learners and on the examination instructions.

The materials will be released, written using the standard Python IDLE IDE and will use TKINTER library for graphical user elements.

Centres may use an IDE of their choice for teaching programming knowledge and skills. However, learners are required to use the Python IDLE IDE version specified in the prerelease for the Unit 2 examination.

| 2.1.1 Investigation     | • use a systematic approach to problem solving including the use of decomposition and abstraction                                                                         | Decomposition involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts. Abstraction simplifies a problem by removing unnecessary details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |  |
|                         | • use abstraction effectively to model selected aspects of the external world in an algorithm or program                                                                  | Learners should apply abstraction to remove irrelevant information from a real world scenario and model the simplified version into an algorithm or program. It is advantageous for abstraction to occur before decomposition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |  |
|                         | • use abstraction effectively to appropriately structure programs into modular parts with clear, well-documented interfaces                                               | Abstraction allows for implementation of a structured and efficient solution. Modular components of programs should be implemented with self-contained subroutines. Interfaces should be clear and unambiguous. When documenting interfaces, all documentation should be as unambiguous as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |  |

Leaners should be able to determine the data which is required to be input, processed and output from the requirements along with the most appropriate methods of storing the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |  |

A new scenario will be set by WJEC each year. This will form context of the examination and will feature tasks based on the scenario. From these requirements learners should understand the requirements, constraints and assumptions of the scenario.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |  |

The same version will be used in the examination. Learners should create their own solution to the problem to ensure they are familiar with the requirements of the unit. To meet requirements learners should be able to understand the requirements, create success criteria and be able to program solutions to these criteria.                                                                                                                  |  |

#### 2.4.2 Refinement and evaluation

- demonstrate understanding of the requirements and any changes required by revised requirements
- demonstrate understanding of changes by presenting evidence of developmental changes
- demonstrate testing and refinement of code to improve efficiency
- discuss the strengths and weaknesses of differing approaches to meeting the requirements
- demonstrate an understanding of the technical terminology/concepts used during software development
- evaluate the outcomes of the original given code
- evaluate the outcomes of the changes made by additional requirements
- explain the solution or changes made to a solution.

Learners will be required to; clearly express the initial requirements for the software development project, identify and explain any changes in the requirements that were introduced during the development process. They will also be required to discuss how these changes impacted the overall design and implementation of the software.

To demonstrate understanding of changes by presenting evidence of developmental changes, learners will need to explain the reasoning behind the changes made and how they addressed the revised requirements to improve the software's functionality.

Learners need to be able to describe the testing strategies and techniques used to evaluate the code's performance and identify areas for improvement. They will need to be able to provide or annotate examples of changes made to the code discussing the impact of these refinements on the program.

Learners should be able to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of differing approaches to meeting the requirements, explaining alternative design or implementation approaches that were considered during the development process giving an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each approach explaining and critically evaluating the reasoning behind the chosen solution.

Learners need to demonstrate an understanding of the technical terminology/concepts used during software development by using appropriate technical terminology and concepts related to programming, and computer science. They should be able to explain the relevance and application of these concepts within the context of the scenario.

To evaluate the outcomes of the original given code, learners need to assess the performance, functionality, and overall effectiveness of the initial solution identifying limitations, issues, or areas for improvement in the original code.

{18}------------------------------------------------

Leaners need to evaluate the outcomes of the changes made by additional requirements by assessing the impact of the changes made to address the updated requirements. They are required to analyse the improvements of the introduced code in the updated solution. And provide an evaluation of the final solution.

Learners should explain the solution, or changes made to a solution, by clearly communicating the final solution and the rationale behind the decisions they made. They need to describe the specific changes or refinements made to the original solution to address the updated requirements and demonstrate their ability to communicate the technical details and reasoning behind their solution.

#### Clarification on working with others in Unit 2

When working on the pre-release, learners can work in groups, pairs or individually to increase their understanding, knowledge and skills in programming. However, the examination will require learners to answer the questions individually.
