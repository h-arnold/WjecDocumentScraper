# GCSE COMPUTER SCIENCE

<span id="page-5-1"></span>

# SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENT

**Unit 1: Understanding Computer Science Digital examination: 1 hour 30 minutes 50% of qualification**

**80 marks**

Questions requiring objective responses, short and extended answers.

**Unit 2: Computer Programming On-screen examination based on a pre-released** 

**brief: 2 hours 50% of qualification** 

**80 marks**

Set and marked by WJEC.

The pre-released brief will include a scenario. A new scenario will be set by WJEC each year. The pre-released brief will be available via the WJEC Portal. The assessment will feature tasks based on the scenario.

This is a unitised qualification.

It is not tiered.

Unit 1 examination will be available in the summer each year. It will be first awarded in 2026.

Unit 2 examination will be available in the summer each year. It will first be awarded in 2027.

It would be most appropriate for learners to complete Unit 2 in the final year of the course. This would allow learners to implement their understanding of computer science concepts developed throughout Unit 1. It would also allow learners to build on the approaches and practices learnt in Unit 1.

The Unit 2 examination will be based on a pre-release brief which will be issued to centres in the academic year before the assessment is scheduled to take place (for example, September 2025 for the 2027 examination). Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the first academic year of study to share the brief with learners.

# 1 INTRODUCTION

<span id="page-6-1"></span>

## 1.1 Aims

GCSE Computer Science supports learners to:

- understand and apply principles and concepts of computer science
- explain the features and functions of systems
- develop skills in computational thinking
- model and analyse problems in computational terms in order to develop and implement strategies to solve them
- develop their understanding of, and ability to apply, the systems development life cycle
- apply relevant mathematical skills
- explore relevant social, professional, ethical, environmental and legal dimensions of systems.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales' Approval Criteria.

<span id="page-6-2"></span>

## 1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Computer Science qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/statements-of-what-matters/)  [what matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/statements-of-what-matters/) and those [subject specific skills and concepts](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area) outlined in the '[Designing](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area)  [your Curriculum](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/science-and-technology/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area)' section of the Science and Technology Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted on page 26; the Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

The GCSE Computer Science qualification will support the Curriculum for Wales by:

- supporting the statements of what matters[1](#page-6-3) by giving learners the opportunity to:
  - develop and test models
  - consider the social, professional, ethical, environmental and legal impact of systems and the use of technology
  - become enterprising, real-world problem solvers through developing skills in computational thinking.

{8}------------------------------------------------

- supporting the principles of progression[2](#page-7-2) by encouraging learners to:
  - engage with iterative problem solving and design
  - explore and experience increasingly complex ideas (for example, in programming tasks in the pre-released brief that are further refined and expanded upon in the examination).
- supporting the subject specific considerations for Computer Science[3](#page-7-3) by:
  - learning about the design, development and application of technology, software and systems
  - building understanding of how technologies can impact learners' lives and future careers.

The GCSE Computer Science qualification is based on the following concepts:

- computer architecture
- structure of systems and function
- how systems communicate
- security
- problem solving
  - algorithmic
  - functional decomposition
- programming
- language and compilers
- logical operations
- operating systems
- systems development life cycle.

<span id="page-7-0"></span>

## 1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of Computer Science at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

<span id="page-7-1"></span>

## 1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE Computer Science has been designed to be delivered within 120 – 140 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

<span id="page-8-0"></span>

## 1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

<span id="page-8-1"></span>

## 1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills, without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website [\(www.jcq.org.uk\)](https://www.jcq.org.uk/).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

# 2 SUBJECT CONTENT

<span id="page-9-1"></span>

## How to read the amplification

The amplification provided in the right-hand column uses the following four stems:

- 'Learners should know' is used when learners are required to use direct recall.
- 'Learners should be aware of' is used when learners do not need to understand all aspects of the specified content in detail. Teachers should refer to Guidance for Teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and breadth to which this content should be taught.
- 'Learners should understand' is used when learners are required to demonstrate greater depth than straight identification or recall. For example, they can apply knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and can synthesise and evaluate information for a given purpose.
- 'Learners should be able to' is used when learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques.

The use of the word 'including' indicates that the specified content must be taught and could be subject to assessment.

The use of the words 'for example' or 'such as' indicates that the specified content is for guidance only, and alternative examples could be chosen.

#### Opportunities for integration of learning experiences

GCSE Computer Science generates opportunities for the following learning experiences to be developed (the experiences will not be directly assessed):

- undertake 'unplugged' learning and development activities to help bring to life computational concepts
- engage with examples and achievements in programming that have provided solutions to real-world problems
- engage in discussions about the potential impacts of the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and technologies, and developments in this field
- use design-thinking to understand how a range of approaches could solve computer science problems
- develop collaboration and teamwork skills by working with, and learning from, others
- gain awareness and appreciation of some of the different careers and work-related areas that draw upon computer science.

The Guidance for Teaching will include further information on the opportunities provided by the qualification, for teachers/centres to integrate these learning experiences into delivery.

For opportunities to develop cross-cutting themes, cross-curricular skills and integral skills please see Appendix A.

# 3 ASSESSMENT

<span id="page-28-1"></span>

## 3.1 Assessment objectives and weightings

Below are the assessment objectives for this specification. Learners must:

### **AO1**

Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the key concepts and principles of computer science

### **AO2**

Apply knowledge and understanding of key concepts and principles of computer science

### **AO3**

Analyse problems in computational terms:

- to make reasoned judgements
- to design, program, evaluate, and refine solutions.

The table below shows the weighting of each assessment objective for each unit and for the qualification as a whole.

|                   | AO1 | AO2 | AO3 | Total |
|-------------------|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Unit 1            | 30% | 15% | 5%  | 50%   |
| Unit 2            | 0%  | 25% | 25% | 50%   |
| Overall weighting | 30% | 40% | 30% | 100%  |

<span id="page-28-2"></span>

# 3.2 Arrangements for pre-release brief and examination for Unit 2

For this assessment it is required that learners are provided with a pre-release brief that includes information for candidates and a scenario. This brief will be made available to centres in September of the first year of study (Year 10) in preparation for the examination in the second year of study (Year 11). The pre-release brief will be made available on the WJEC Portal. It is up to centres to choose exactly when to distribute the pre-release brief to learners, but it MUST be during Year 10.

Learners will be required to familiarise themselves with the scenario ready to complete an examination based on the pre-released brief in the summer examination series or Year 11. It must be emphasised that learners are not permitted to take any prompts or notes into the examination. Learners will be provided with a clean copy of the pre-release materials when sitting the examination.

This assessment contributes to 50% of the overall qualification grade and will take 2 hours to complete. The assignment will be marked out of a total of 80 marks.

# 4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for GCSE Computer Science.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our [Guide to preventing, reporting and](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)  [investigating malpractice.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC (malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet [Suspected](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)  [Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)

## 5.1 Entries and Awards

This is a unitised qualification. Candidates are entered for each unit separately.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer assessment period each year, for the lifetime of the specification.

Unit 1 will be available in 2026 (and each year thereafter). Unit 2 will be available in 2027 (and each year thereafter) and the qualification will be awarded for the first time in summer 2027.

### Pre-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or under on 1st August in the academic year in which they were entered)

The terminal rule is set at 40% of the overall qualification for Pre-16 Candidates for GCSE Computer Science.

If the assessment being re-taken contributes to the 40% terminal rule requirement, the mark for the new assessment will count regardless of previous results in that assessment.

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade subject to the terminal rule being satisfied first i.e. that candidates must complete 40% of the assessment for a qualification in the series in which they are cashing in.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s). This is referred to as a 'fresh start'. When retaking a qualification (fresh start), a candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from examination units taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating the new grade(s).

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

### Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1st September in the academic year in which they are entered)

There is no terminal rule that applies to Post-16 Candidates for GCSE Computer Science.

There is no limit on the number of times a candidate can resit an individual unit; however, the better uniform mark score from the most two recent attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade.

The 'fresh start' rule does not apply to post-16 candidates.

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

## 5.2 Grading, awarding and reporting

GCSE qualifications are reported on an eight-point scale from A\*-G, where A\* is the highest grade. Results not attaining the minimum standard for the award will be reported as U (unclassified).

Individual unit results are reported on a uniform mark scale (UMS) with the following grade equivalences:

|                  | MAX. | A*  | A   | B   | C   | D   | E  | F  | G  |
|------------------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|----|----|----|
| Unit 1           | 100  | 90  | 80  | 70  | 60  | 50  | 40 | 30 | 20 |
| Unit 2           | 100  | 90  | 80  | 70  | 60  | 50  | 40 | 30 | 20 |
