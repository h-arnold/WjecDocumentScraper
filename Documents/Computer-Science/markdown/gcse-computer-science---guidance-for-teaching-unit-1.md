- registers:
  - program counter (PC)
  - current instruction register (CIR)
  - accumulator (ACC)
  - memory address register (MAR)
  - memory data register (MDR).

Learners should know how performance of a CPU is affected by:

- cache size and levels of cache
- clock speed
- number of cores.

Learners should be aware of:

- the legal, ethical and social consideration surrounding designing, manufacturing and disposing of computer hardware
- historical development of computers
- the ethical considerations in designing and manufacturing components
- the environmental impact of manufacturing and disposing of hardware
- strategies for designing more energy-efficient architectures
- historical development of components, from early transistors to modern microprocessors
- advancements in materials and manufacturing have influenced the design and efficiency of components over time.

- **Expansion cards** these add additional functionality to the computer by plugging into the expansion slots on the motherboard. They provide extra capabilities for the computer systems. Examples include:
  - **Graphic cards** responsible for rendering images, videos and animations on the monitor. These are essential for gaming, video editing and graphic intensive tasks.
  - **Sound cards** manage the input and output of audio signals. They improve sound quality, receive audio signals from microphones and musical instruments and provide audio for speakers.
- **Network Interface Card (NIC) -** allows a computer to connect to a network, such as internet or local area network (LAN):
  - **Wired NICs** use cable, such as ethernet, to connect a computer to a network
  - **Wireless NICs** uses Wi-Fi technology to connect to a network without the need for wires.
- **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) -** responsible for rendering images, videos and animations. It processes graphical data and is essential for tasks like gaming, video editing and 3D rendering. There are two types of GPUs:
  - **Integrated** is built into the processor chip and shares the memory with the CPU. It uses less power than dedicated GPUs.
  - **Dedicated** has its own memory, known as VRAM, and doesn't share it with the CPU. It consumes more power and has higher performance when compared to integrated GPUs.
- **Cooling Systems -** provide a way of regulating the temperature of key components, such as the CPU and GPU. This prevents overheating and therefore damage to the components. There are two main types:
  - **Liquid Cooling** uses liquid to transfer heat away from the components.

{11}------------------------------------------------

- **Air Cooling** - uses fans and/or heat sinks to dissipate the heat.
- **Connectivity ports** allow the computer to interact with external devices and peripherals.
  - **Universal Serial Bus (USB)** - used to connect external devices like, keyboards, mice, headsets and storage devices. USB ports are versatile and support data transfer and power supply. USB connectors are assigned letter s to indicate their type, Type -A, Type -B, Type -C. USB ports also have numbers included to specify the USB generation. Currently , there are 4: USB 1.x, USB 2.0, USB 3.x, and USB 4. Each generation allows for faster transmission speeds and power delivery.
  - **Display ports** - connect monitors or display devices to the system, providing high -definition video outputs. The main display ports are VGA , DVI, HDMI and DisplayPort .
    - VGA: Older analogue video port.
    - Digital Video Interface (DVI): Supports both analogue and digital video signals.
    - HDMI: High -definition multimedia interface for video and audio.
    - DisplayPort: Popular for high -resolution displays.
  - **Ethernet ports** - allow for wired network connections, typically used for stable and fast internet or network connectivity.
  - **Audio ports –** provide connections for audio input/output devices like headphones, microphones and speakers. Common audio ports include:
    - **3.5 mm Connector:** Used for headphones, microphones, and speakers.
    - **S/PDIF / TOSLINK:** For digital audio transmission.
    - **RCA Connector:** Commonly used for stereo audio and video connections.

{12}------------------------------------------------

Understanding the CPU and its components is essential to grasp how computers perform complex tasks and respond to user commands with incredible speed and accuracy.

**The CPU** is the brain of the computer. Its purpose is to execute instructions from programs, manage data, perform calculations and control the flow of data.

**Von Neumann architecture** is a design model which is used in modern computers and holds both instructions and data. Its key units include:

- CPU Central Processing Unit executes instructions
- Memory Primary storage: Random Access Memory stores both instructions and data. Secondary Storage: SSD, HDD store data for retrieval at a later date.
- Input/Output Devices such as keyboards, mice, monitors.
- Buses The bus system transfers data between components. There is the address bus, data bus and control bus

![](_page_12_Figure_8.jpeg)

{13}------------------------------------------------

#### **The CPU**

- **Control Unit (CU)**  - The **control unit** directs the operation of the processor by controlling the flow of data between the CPU, memory, and peripherals. It decodes the instruction and signals other parts of the CPU to perform actions during the execute phase.
- **Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) -** The **ALU** performs all arithmetic, such as addition and subtraction, and logical comparison operations.
- **Registers** are small, fast storage areas inside the CPU that hold data temporarily.

The following registers are key to the fetch -decode -execute cycle :

- **Program Counter (PC) -** Holds the memory address of the next instruction to be fetched. After each fetch, the PC is incremented to point to the next instruction.
- **Current Instruction Register (CIR) -** Stores the instruction that has just been fetched from memory and is about to be decoded and executed.
- **Accumulator (ACC) -** Temporarily holds data being used during calculations in the ALU. It also stores the result of operations performed by the ALU.
- **Memory Address Register (MAR) -** Holds the memory address of the data or instruction that needs to be fetched from or written to memory.
- **Memory Data Register (MDR) -** Temporarily stores the data being fetched from or written to memory. It works in alongside the MAR. The MDR holds the actual data being transferred to or from the address specified by the MAR.
- **Cache memory** is a small, fast memory located in or near the CPU. It stores frequently used instructions and data to reduce the time needed to access data from the main memory (RAM). It speeds up the fetch process in the cycle.

There are three levels of cache:

{14}------------------------------------------------

- **Level 1:** The smallest and fastest cache which is located inside the CPU.
- **Level 2:** Larger than level 1 but slower. It ser ves as bridge between level 1 and level 3 or main memory (RAM) . It can either be located inside the CPU or outside, depending on the architecture of the motherboard.
- **Level 3:** Found outside the CPU. It is shared among cores, this cache is larger and slower than L1 and L2 caches, but faster than RAM. It helps improve performance when multiple cores are trying to access the same data.
- The **fetch -decode -execute cycle** is the basic process the CPU uses to execute instructions. It involves fetching the instruction from memory, decoding it, and then executing it. Each part of the cycle is managed by a different component of the CPU. The main operations which occur during each phase of the Fetch -Decode - Execute cycle are:
  - Fetch phase:
    - Load the **MAR** with the address of the next instruction to be executed.
    - Check if the instruction is in the **cache memory**. If it is, fetch it directly from the cache.
    - If the instruction is not in the cache, fetch it from main memory into the **MDR**, then transfer it to the **CIR**. Store the fetched instruction in the **cache** .
- Increment the **PC** to point to the address of the next instruction.
  - Decode phase:
    - The **CU** translates the instruction in the **CIR**.
    - The **CU** determines the required operations and selects the necessary machine resources. Check the **cache** for any required data. If the data is not in the **cache**, fetch it from main memory into the **MDR** .
  - Execute phase:

{15}------------------------------------------------

- The instruction is executed, which may involve mathematical or logical operations in the **ALU**, memory access, or I/O operations.
- Use the **ACC** to store intermediate results. The **MDR** may be used to transfer data between the **CPU** and memory.

#### Factors that affect CPU performance

- : • Clock speed : is the frequency with which the CPU can execute instructions , one clock tick per second would be measured as 1 Hz . The clock speed is commonly measured in gigahertz (GHz) which means that if there is a clock speed of 3 GHz it can execute 3 billion instructions per second.
- Number of cores: A core is an independent processing unit within a CPU. Modern CPUs can have multiple cores, allowing them to perform multiple tasks **simultaneously:**
- Dual -core will have 2 cores
- Quad -core will have 4 cores
- Hexa -core will have 6 cores
- Deca -core will have 10 cores
- it is also possible to get 12, 16, 24 and 64 cores within a CPU
- Cache size: Larger cache sizes reduce the average memory access time; more frequently accessed data is stored closer to the CPU cores. This allows for faster execution of instructions since the CPU spends less time waiting for data to be fetched from slower main memory.
- Parallel processing : More cores enable better multitasking and can significantly improve performance in applications designed for parallel processing.
- Threading : is how the processor handles and executes multiple sequences of instructions (called **threads**) simultaneously. Each thread represents a single sequence of operations that the CPU can execute independently.
- Single threading can only execute one thread at a time.

{16}------------------------------------------------

• Multilevel threading allows a single CPU core to manage more than one thread at a time, which improves performance in multi tasking and parallel processing.

#### **RAM**

- **Temporary Storage**: RAM holds data that the computer's processor needs right now or in the near future. When you turn off your computer, all data in RAM is lost.
- **Speed**: RAM is much faster than other types of storage like hard drives or SSDs. This speed helps your computer run smoothly and quickly.
- **Volatile Memory**: This means that RAM needs power to keep the data. Once the power is off, the data is gone.
- **Capacity**: The amount of RAM in a computer can affect its performance. More RAM allows a computer to handle more tasks at once without slowing down. RAM can range from gigabytes to terabytes.
- **Types** of RAM:
- **DRAM (Dynamic RAM)**: This is the most common type of RAM used in computers.
- **SRAM (Static RAM)**: Faster and more expensive than DRAM, used in smaller amounts for cache memory.

#### **Buses**

- **Data Bus:** Carries the actual data being processed. For example, when you open a file, the data bus transfers the file's data from the hard drive to the RAM.
- **Address Bus:** Carries information about where the data should go. It tells the computer where to find or store data in memory.
- **Control Bus:** Carries control signals that manage the operations of the computer. These signals ensure that all parts of the computer work together smoothly.

{17}------------------------------------------------

![](_page_17_Figure_1.jpeg)

#### **Legal Considerations:**

- **Intellectual Property:** Protecting the patents and designs used in creating hardware.
- **Data Privacy:** Ensuring hardware design doesn't compromise user privacy or lead to security breaches.
- **Regulations:** Following environmental and safety standards during manufacturing, including hazardous material use and disposal.

#### **Ethical Considerations:**

- **Labour Practices:** Making sure workers in factories that produce computer hardware have fair conditions, without exploitation or unsafe environments.
- **Conflict Minerals:** Not using minerals from areas where mining money supports human rights abuses.
- **Planned Obsolescence:** Considering the lifecycle of products to ensure that devices are not designed to force consumers to buy new products more frequently.

{18}------------------------------------------------

#### **Social Considerations:**

- **Digital Divide:** Designing affordable and accessible hardware to reduce the gap between those with and without access to technology.
- **E -waste:** The growing volume of electronic waste due to the short lifecycle of devices and the need for better recycling systems to prevent environmental issues.

#### **Historical Development of Computers**

From early mechanical devices to modern computing, computers have evolved drastically.

- **Early Transistors:** Replaced vacuum tubes in the mid -20th century, making computers smaller, faster, and more reliable.
- **Integrated Circuits (ICs):** Allowed multiple transistors to be placed on a single chip, further reducing size and increasing computing power.
- **Microprocessors:** Introduced in the 1970s, integrating the CPU onto a single chip, revolutionising personal computing.
- **Modern Multi -core CPUs:** Modern processors have multiple cores, each capable of handling tasks simultaneously, improving efficiency and performance.

Understand how the advancements in materials and manufacturing have influenced the design and efficiency of components over time .

- **Silicon and Semiconductor Technology**: Silicon is used to create tiny electrical circuits on chips, enabling the development of smaller and faster computers with integrated circuits. Making these components smaller , increases processing power in addition to lowering costs and energy consumption.
- **Nanotechnology**: Nanotechnology involves manipulating materials at an atomic level to create nano transistors, enabling smaller, faster, and more efficient processors. This makes the transistors more packed and denser therefore increasing speed and energy efficiency.

{21}------------------------------------------------

- the general features of secondary storage media in terms of:
  - capacity
  - durability
  - reliability
  - read/write speed
  - cost per unit of storage.

Learners should be aware of developments in storage technologies and capacity over time.

#### **Cache Memory**

- Provides quick access to frequently used data and instructions for the processor.
- Very fast, smaller than RAM, and located either in or close to the CPU.
- Temporarily stores copies of data from main memory to speed up processing.

#### **Virtual Memory**

- Extends the computer's RAM by using part of the hard drive as additional memory.
- Allows more applications to run simultaneously by swapping data in and out of RAM.
- Slower than actual RAM since it relies on hard disk speed.
- The process of moving data between RAM and the hard drive is called paging.
- The operating system breaks down the data into small chunks and manages which pages are in RAM and which are in virtual memory.
- Thrashing occurs when a computer's virtual memory system overused, causing a significant slowdown in performance.
- This happens when the system spends more time swapping pages between the RAM and the hard drive than executing actual instructions.

#### **Secondary Storage Media**

There are various secondary storage technologies that exist and when trying to understand examples of use, it is important to understand the characteristics that will affect the decision.

#### **General characteristics of Secondary Storage Media**

- **Capacity**: The amount of data a storage device can hold. It varies widely among different types of storage.
- **Durability**: How well a storage medium can withstand physical damage and environmental conditions. Solid state storage is typically more durable than magnetic storage.

{22}------------------------------------------------

- **Reliability**: The likelihood that the storage device will perform correctly without failure. Magnetic and optical media can be prone to wear over time.
- **Read/Write Speed**: The speed at which data can be read from or written to the storage device. SSDs generally offer faster speeds than HDDs and optical storage.

#### **Optical Storage**

- CDs, DVDs, Blu -ray discs.
- Uses laser technology to read and write data.
- Generally, has lower capacity compared to other storage types.

#### **Optical Storage Characteristics:**

- Capacity:
  - CDs (Compact Discs):
    - Standard capacity is typically **700 MB**
    - Can hold audio, data, or other digital formats.
  - DVDs (Digital Versatile Discs) :
    - Standard single -layer DVDs hold **4.7 GB**, while dual -layer DVDs can hold **8.5 GB** .

.

- Suitable for video content, software, and data storage.
- Blu -ray Discs :
  - Single -layer Blu -ray discs can hold **25 GB**, and dual -layer discs can hold **50 GB** .
  - Designed for high -definition video and large data storage.
- Durability :
  - Optical discs are generally more resistant to environmental factors like humidity and temperature than magnetic media. However, they can be scratched, which may affect data retrieval.
- Reliability:
  - Optical storage is considered reliable for long -term storage, as data is less susceptible to magnetic fields compared to magnetic storage.

{23}------------------------------------------------

- Read/Write Speeds :
  - The read/write speeds vary by format, with newer technologies like Blu -ray offering faster performance and greater capacity than traditional CDs and DVDs. However, it is slower than other methods of secondary storage.

#### **Magnetic Storage**

- Hard drives (HDDs), magnetic tapes.
- Uses magnetic fields to store data.
- Offers large capacity and is cost-effective for extensive data storage.

#### **Magnetic Storage Characteristics:**

- Capacity:
  - HDDs offer capacities ranging from 500 GB to over 20 TB.
  - Magnetic tapes are often used for backup and archival purposes in data centres. A single tape can hold up to 20 TB or more.
- Durability :
  - HDDs contain moving parts (platters and read/write heads), making them vulnerable to physical damage from drops, shocks, or vibrations.
  - Over time, mechanical components can wear out, especially with constant use.
  - Magnetic tapes are more durable for long -term storage and can last for many years if stored correctly.
  - Tapes can be damaged by dust or strong magnetic fields but are generally more durable than HDDs in static environments.
- Reliability
  - Generally reliable for storing large amounts of data, but they have a higher risk of failure compared to solid -state storage due to moving parts.
  - Tapes are considered highly reliable for long -term archive storage.

{24}------------------------------------------------

- Read/Write Speeds:
  - HDD speeds are dependent on the rotation speeds measured in RPM.
  - Magnetic tape is slower and because data is stored sequentially, accessing specific data can be slow.
  - HDD and Magnetic tape have faster read/write speeds than optical storage.

#### **Solid State Storage**

- Solid State Drives (SSDs).
- Uses flash memory technology for data storage.
- Faster than magnetic drives and more durable, as they have no moving parts.

#### **Solid State Storage Characteristics:**

- Capacity:
  - SSDs can range from 128 GB to 4 TB for personal devices, with larger capacities available of 100 TB or more, but these come at a very high price.
- Durability :
  - SSDs have no moving parts, making them much more durable than HDDs.
  - They are more resilient to drops, shocks and vibrations.
  - SSDs do have a limited number of read/write cycles, but modern SSDs are designed to last for many years.
- Reliability :
  - SDs are highly reliable for storing data, as they don't suffer from mechanical failure like HDDs.
  - SSDs are generally more reliable than HDDs, but data recovery from a failed SSD is often more difficult.
  - Read/Write Speeds:
    - SSDs have extremely low latency compared to HDDs, meaning they can access and transfer data almost instantly.

{25}------------------------------------------------

#### **Cloud Storage**

- Services like Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud.
- Stores data on remote servers accessed via the internet.
- Provides flexibility and accessibility from anywhere with an internet connection, with various subscription plans for different storage needs.

#### **Cloud Storage Characteristics:**

- Capacity:
  - This could be considered unlimited, there is scalable options of data capacity, but often at a price, usually through a subscription.
- Durability:
  - Highly durable due to the responsibility of the cloud company to ensure the access of data. This is done through data backup systems.
- Reliability:
  - Cloud data is distributed across multiple servers, therefore even if one server fails, users can still access their data from another. This makes cloud storage more reliable than local drives that could fail without warning.
- Read/Write Speeds:
  - This is internet dependent, the read (download) and write (upload) speeds are based on the connection of the individual.

As data is transmitted to remote servers, latency is possible and higher than SSD or HDD but is generally not noticeable by the users.

 how to calculate the storage requirements for graphics using different dimensions, bit depths and colour depths.

#### Learners should understand:

- the digital storage of sound
- the effect of different sampling rates on the quality of sound
- how to calculate the storage requirements for sound using different sampling rates and bit depths.

#### Learners should understand:

- the relationship between data storage units using the base 2 prefixes, including:
  - bit
  - nibble
  - byte
  - kilobyte (i.e. 1,024 bytes)
  - megabyte (i.e. 1,024 kilobytes)
  - gigabyte (i.e. 1,024 megabytes)
  - terabyte (i.e. 1,024 gigabytes)
  - petabyte (i.e. 1,024 terabytes)
- the calculation of data capacity requirements.

#### Learners should understand:

- the principles of data compression and the use of different compression types, including:
  - lossy
  - lossless
- calculation of compression ratios and the reduction in file sizes following compression.

$$4 \div 2 = 2 r 0$$
  
 $2 \div 2 = 1 r 0$   
 $1 \div 2 = 0 r 1$ 

Starting from the bottom put the remainders in order.

Therefore binary = 100101

**Binary to Denary**: Multiply each bit by 2 to the power of its position and add the results of the outcome.

Binary: 1 0 1 0 1 Position: 4 3 2 1 0

Multiply each bit by 2position

$$1 \times 2^{4} = 1 \times 16 = 16$$

$$0 \times 2^{3} = 0 \times 9 = 0$$

$$1 \times 2^{2} = 1 \times 4 = 4$$

$$0 \times 2^{1} = 0 \times 2 = 0$$

$$1 \times 2^{0} = 1 \times 1 = 1$$

Sum the results:

$$16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 21$$

**Denary to Hexadecimal**: Divide the number by 16 and include the remainder. Any value of the remainder that is greater than 9 will become the Hexadecimal value represented by a letter A-F.

$$213 \div 16 = 13 r 5$$
  
 $13 \div 16 = 0 r 13 (13 = D)$   
**D5**

{28}------------------------------------------------

• **Hexadecimal to Denary**: Multiply each bit by 16 to the power of its position and add the results of the outcome.

> **Hexadecimal:** 9 B *Position: 1 0*

Multiply each hexadecimal value by 16position

$$9 \times 16^{1} = 9 \times 16 = 144$$
  
 $(B = 11)$   
 $11 \div 16^{0} = 11 \times 1 = 11$ 

Sum the results:

$$144 + 11 = 155$$

• **Binary to Hexadecimal**: Group binary digits in sets of 4 (from right to left) and convert each group to its hexadecimal equivalent.

```
10100101
(1010) (0101)
1010 = 10 = A
0101 = 5
A5
```

• **Hexadecimal to Binary**: Convert each hexadecimal digit to its 4-bit binary equivalent then join them together.

9D 9 = 1001 D = 13 = 1101 **10011101**

#### **Binary Addition**

Use the following rules to correctly add binary values.

{29}------------------------------------------------

- 0 + 0 = 0
- 0 + 1 = 1
- 1 + 0 = 1
- 1 + 1 = 10 (which is 0 with a carry of 1)
- 1 + 1 + 1 = 11 (which is 1 with a carry of 1)
- If there is a carry, add it to the next column.

#### *Example:*

01101011

10001011 +

**11110110**

1 11 carry

#### **Digital Storage of Graphics**

#### **Vector graphics are stored using mathematics**

- A vector uses mathematical representations of geometrically primitive objects (lines, curves etc.) to represent images.
- Vector graphics can be scaled up without loss of apparent quality.
- They are smaller than bitmap graphics in terms of the memory required to store them.
- Vectors can be edited easily and are used for graphical designs such as, logos and icons.

#### **Raster graphics are stored in pixels:**

- Each pixel has a colour value that is stored as a binary value.
- Each image will have a bit depth, which impacts on the size and quality of the image.
- The greater the bit depth the more colour information, detail and greater quality, but also a larger file size.

#### **Resolution**

- This refers to the number of pixels in an image, represented by width and height.
- The higher the resolution the greater the quality and detail of the images.

{30}------------------------------------------------

• The higher the resolution the higher the file size.

#### **Bit Depth**

- The number of bits used to represent the colour of **each pixel** in an image.
- It specifies how many bits are used to store information about a pixel's colour.
- An 8-bit bit depth means that 8 bits will be allocated **per pixel**. Allowing for 256 different combinations.
- The higher the bit depth, the larger the file size and increased quality.

#### **Colour Depth:**

- The number of colours that an image can represent affected by the bit depth.
- Higher values allow for more colours to be represented.
- When referred to, this will be as "bits per channel" (bpc).
- Example: 8-bit colour depth for "RGB" would be:
  - 8-bits for **R**, 8-bits for **G** and 8-bits for **B**.

Note: Historical lower-depth systems mainly used bits per pixel (bpp). This specification uses modern conventions of bits per component (also known as bits per channel) (bpc)

#### **Colour Model:**

- A mathematical model describing the way that colours can be represented as tuples of numbers.
- These are typically three or four values or colour components (e.g., RGB, CMYK)

#### **Calculating Image Storage Requirements**

To calculate the storage requirement for an image, you need to know:

- 1. Resolution: The width and height of the image in pixels.
- 2. Colour Depth: The number of bits used per channel.
- 3. Bit Depth: The number of bits used per pixel.

{31}------------------------------------------------

#### **Step-by-Step Calculation**

#### **Formula for calculation:**

Storage Size = (Width × Height × Bits Per Pixel)

#### **Determine the Total Number of Pixels:**

- Multiply the width by the height of the image.
- Example: For an image with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels:

$$Total\ Pixels = 1920 \times 1080 = 2,073,600\ pixels$$

#### **Calculate Bits Per Pixel (bpp):**

- Multiply the bit depth by the number of channels.
- Example: For an 8-bit RGB image:

$$Bits \ Per \ Pixel = 8 \ (bits - Red) + 8 \ (bits - Green) + 8 \ (bits - Blue)$$
  
= 24 bits

### **Calculate Total bits:**

- Multiply the total number of pixels by the bits per pixel.
- Example:

$$\textit{Total bits} = 2,073,600 \ \textit{pixels} \times 24 \ \textit{bits} = 49,766,400 \ \textit{bits}$$

#### **Convert bits to bytes:**

- Divide the total bits by 8 (1 byte = 8 bits).
- Example:

$$Total\ bytes = \frac{49,766,400\ bits}{8} = 6,220,800\ bytes$$

#### **Convert bytes to kilobytes (KB):**

• Divide the total bytes by 1024 (since 1 KB = 1024 bytes).

{32}------------------------------------------------

• Example:

$$Total\ KB = \frac{6,220,800\ bytes}{1024} \approx 6075\ KB$$

### **Convert kilobytes to megabytes (MB):**

- Divide the total KB by 1024 (since 1 MB = 1024 KB).
- Example:

$$Total\ MB = \frac{6075\ KB}{1024} \approx 5.93\ MB$$

#### **The digital storage of sound**

Sound must be converted from analogue to digital to be stored. The sound waves are sampled at time intervals. The sound sample points are converted to the nearest numerical value.

- **Sample**: A single measurement of sound taken at a specific point in time
- **Channels**: The number of audio channels, mono being 1 channel and stereo being 2 channels.
- **Sample Rate**: The number of samples of audio carried per second, measured in Hz or kHz. - also known as Sample Frequency
- **Bit Depth**: For audio, this is the number of bits used to record each sample. Higher bit depths allow for more precise representation of a sound's amplitude
- **Bit Rate**: The amount of data processed per second of sound. It is calculated by multiplying the sample rate by the bit depth
- **Sample Quality**: The term used to describe the effect of the sample rate/frequency.

#### **Calculating Sound Storage Requirements Formula:**

Storage Size = �Sample Rate × Bit Depth × Channels × Duration (seconds)�

{33}------------------------------------------------

#### **Calculate Total bits:**

- Multiply the given Sample Rate, Bit Depth, Number of Channels and Duration
- Example: A stereo (2 channels) audio file with a sample rate of 44.1 kHz (44,100 samples per second), a bit depth of 16 bits, a duration of 3 minutes (180 seconds):

Total bits = 
$$44100 \times 16 \times 2 \times 180 = 254,016,000$$
 bits

### **Convert bits to bytes**

• Divide the total bits by 8 (1 byte = 8 bits).

Total bytes = 
$$\frac{\text{(Sample Rate } \times \text{ Bit Depth } \times \text{Channels } \times \text{ Duration )}}{8}$$

$$\text{Total bytes} = \frac{254,016,000}{8} = 31,752,000 \text{ bytes}$$

#### **Convert bytes to kilobytes (KB):**

- Divide the total bytes by 1024 (since 1 KB = 1024 bytes).
- Example:

Total bytes = 
$$\frac{31,752,000 \ bytes}{1024} \approx 31,008 \ kilobytes$$

#### **Convert kilobytes to megabytes (MB):**

- Divide the total KB by 1024 (since 1 MB = 1024 KB).
- Example:

Total bytes = 
$$\frac{31,008 \ kilobytes}{1024} \approx 30.2 \ megabytes$$

{34}------------------------------------------------

#### **Data Storage Units**

| Data Equivalent storage |  | Number of bits | Number of bytes |  |  |
|-------------------------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--|--|
| bit                           |            | 1                     |                       |  |  |

| Gigabyte (GB) | 1024 GB | 8,589,934,592 | 1,073,741,824 |  |  |
| Terabyte (TB) | 1024 TB | 8,796,093,022,208 | 1,099,511,627,776 |  |  |
| Petabyte (PB) | 1024 PB | 9,007,199,254,740,992 | 1,125,899,906,842,624 |  |  |

#### **Compression**

Compression is the process of decreasing file sizes but still preserving the data so that it is usable. There are two types of compression techniques:

- **Lossy:** 
  - This method will generally reduce the size by a greater amount but will also reduce the quality.
  - The data removed is often considered less important or detectable by the user.
  - Examples: MP3, JPEG, MPEG

{35}------------------------------------------------

#### • **Lossless:**

- This method will maintain the quality but is less likely to reduce the file size by as much as lossy. It enables the file to be uncompressed to original form.
- Reduces file sizes by finding non-essential information and redundancies in the data and encoding them more efficiently using things such as an index file.
- Examples: WAV, PNG, BMP, FLAC

### **Compression Calculations**

**Calculate the size of files based on the compression ratio:**

$$compression \ ratio = \frac{original \ data \ size}{compressed \ data \ size}$$

• Example: Original data size = 1000, Compressed data size = 200

Therefore, the ratio is: 
$$\frac{1000}{200}$$
 or  $\frac{10}{2}$  or 10: 2

**Calculating the compressed file size based on ratio:**

$$compressed\ file\ size\ =\ 
rac{original\ file\ size}{compression\ ratio}$$

• Example: if the original data size is 2000 KB and the compression ratio is 10:2

compressed file size 
$$=\frac{2000}{10 \div 2} = 400kb$$

**Calculating the original file size based on ratio:**

#### **The function of automated systems**

- **Data Acquisition:** The storing of data collected from sensors or other devices and inputted into the system for processing. For example, storing temperature form a nuclear power chamber.
- **Processing and decision-making:** The system analyses the data it gets, interprets it and makes decisions based on programming rules, algorithms or machine learning. For example, a greenhouse turning on sprinklers when the humidity is too low or temperature too high.
- **Control:** Control signals are sent to actuators to perform necessary tasks based on decisions made during the processing stage. For example, starting a motor to control a window in an automated greenhouse.
- **Communication:** This means sending data between different parts of the system or different systems, ensuring everything works together. For example, a self-driving car's sensor talking to its main computer to avoid obstacles or a smart fridge sending data to a mobile app.
- **Feedback and adaption:** The system keeps track of how it is doing and adjusts to improve and optimise its performance. A Greenhouse example: **Feedback:**
  - **User Input**: The user of a greenhouse sets the desired conditions for growing tomatoes, such as temperature at 25°C, humidity at 60%, and light exposure for 12 hours a day.
  - **System Response**: The greenhouse control system adjusts the heating, cooling, humidifiers, and lighting to meet these conditions.
  - **Sensor Data**: The system continuously monitors the temperature, humidity, and light levels using various sensors placed throughout the greenhouse.

#### **Adaptation:**

• **Feedback Analysis**: The system notices that during the afternoon, the temperature tends to rise above 25°C due to intense sunlight, and humidity drops below 60%.

{39}------------------------------------------------

- **System Adjustment**: The system adapts by activating additional cooling measures, such as opening vents or increasing the operation of fans and turning on misting systems to maintain the desired humidity levels.
- **Learning Over Time**: Over time, the system learns the daily and seasonal patterns of temperature and humidity changes. It starts to pre emptively adjust the conditions before they deviate from the set parameters, ensuring a more stable environment for the tomatoes.

#### **Ethical Implications**

- Job Displacement: Some jobs may disappear because machines can do them instead of people or staff will have to retrain to adapt to new technology.
- Privacy Concerns: Automated systems collect a lot of personal data, which can lead to privacy issues if not stored correctly and securely.
- Bias: AI can show unfair results based on wrong data in its training, like biased facial recognition.

#### **Social Implications**

- Economic Inequality: Automation can widen the gap between rich and poor, as skilled workers may gain more benefits than those in vulnerable jobs.
- Accessibility: Automated systems can help people access services better, like AI diagnostics in healthcare for people with disabilities that stop them from attending medical appointments.
- Impact on Human Interaction: Overusing automated systems may reduce face -to -face contact in areas such as customer service and reduce that personal element that comes from human interaction.
- Digital divide: Systems that use automated systems, such as call centres that require navigation and processing through automated systems, may be more difficult for elderly customers.

#### **Legal Implications**

• Liability and Accountability: Who is responsible if an automated system causes harm? This is crucial for systems like self-driving cars.

{40}------------------------------------------------

|  | • • | Regulation and Compliance: Laws are needed to ensure AI and automation are safe and ethical. Intellectual Property Rights: Questions arise about who owns what AI creates, especially in fields like art and literature. |

#### Learners should be aware of:

• the evolution of communication networks, from traditional telecommunication systems to modern high-speed broadband and networks.

• **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** A secure network that allows user to access private networks remotely over the internet. They use encrypted tunnels to protect data. As it uses the internet, the range is extensive but can be slower due to the encryption process.

#### **Advantages of networks:**

- **Resource Sharing:** People can share things like printers and files easily over a network.
- **Communication**: Networks make it easy to communicate through emails, video calls, or text messages.
- **Central Data Management**: Information can be stored in one place, so it is easier to access and avoids duplication.
- **Scalability**: Networks can grow to meet increased demands by adding more devices.
- **Collaboration**: Many people can work on a project together at the same time.

#### **Disadvantages of networks**:

- **Security Issues**: Networks can be at risk from hacking or unwanted access.
- **Setup and Maintenance Costs**: Building a network, especially a big one, can be very expensive.
- **Complexity**: Keeping a large network running well needs advanced skills, and fixing problems can be difficult.
- **Performance Problems**: When many people use the network at once, it may slow down.
- **Dependency:** If the network stops working, everything linked to it can also stop.

#### **Network Topologies Bus Topology:**

All devices are connected to a single central cable, which has terminators at each end to ensure proper operation.

{43}------------------------------------------------

#### **Advantages:**

- Easy and inexpensive to install for small networks.
- Uses less cable compared to other topologies.

#### **Disadvantages:**

- If the main cable fails, the whole network goes down.
- Difficult to troubleshoot.
- Performance degrades as more devices are added due to data collisions.

#### **Ring Topology** :

Devices are connected in a loop, with each device connected to the next, forming a ring.

#### **Advantages:**

- Data travels in one direction, reducing the chances of collisions.
- Better performance than bus topology when handling many devices.

#### **Disadvantages** :

- A failure in any cable or device breaks the entire network.
- Adding or removing devices can disrupt the network.

#### **Star Topology:**

All devices are connected to a central hub or switch, creating a star shaped network.

#### **Advantages:**

- Easy to install and manage.
- Failure of one device doesn't affect the others.
- Easy to add new devices without disrupting the network.

#### **Disadvantages:**

- If the central hub or switch fails, the whole network goes down.
- Requires more cable than bus topology, increasing installation costs.

#### **Mesh Topology:**

Every device is connected to every other device, providing multiple pathways for data.

{44}------------------------------------------------

#### **Advantages:**

- It is highly reliable, as there are many paths for data to travel.
- If one path fails, data can take another route.
- Can expand and modify the topology without disrupting other nodes.

#### **Disadvantages:**

- It is expensive and more complicated to install due to the high number of connections required.
- Usually needs specific staff employed for maintenance and management.

#### **Hardware Needed for Connectivity**

- Routers:
  - Connects different networks and sends data between them.
  - Stores the addresses of computers on a network using a routing table and transfers data between networks and devices.

**:**

- Helps devices access the internet, directs traffic and manages IP addresses.
- Hubs:
  - A basic device that links devices in a LAN and sends data to all of them.
  - Hubs are inexpensive but not efficient since it slows down the network, due to data be sent to all devices across a network.
- Switches:
  - More advanced than hubs .
  - Analyses each packet of data and sends it to the computer it was intended for.
  - Improves network performance in LANs by managing traffic better and improving network performance .
- Bridges:
  - Connects parts of different networks so they work together as a single network .
  - Helps reduce data collisions and can filter data.

{45}------------------------------------------------

- Gateways:
  - Connects different networks that may use different protocols. Gateways can translate data from one network type to another, such as connecting a WAN to a LAN.
  - Helps different networks communicate even if they have different protocols, like a home network to the internet.
- Wireless Access Points (WAPs):
  - Allows wireless devices connect to wired networks using Wi -Fi.
  - Help extend the reach of networks by enabling wireless connectivity.
  - Common in homes and offices for mobile access to the internet.

#### **Network Protocols**

Network protocols are established sets of rules that help determine how the data is transmitted across a network. They are essential for consistent communication with all devices on a network regardless of their differences.

There are several protocols that support network communication , including:

- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):** Is the first protocol of the Internet Protocol suite. It ensures a reliable transmission of data across a network. There are four main characteristics of the TCP; reliable transmission, error checking, order delivery and congestion management.
- **Internet Protocol (IP) :** Is responsible for getting packet s from one location to another through routing. It uses IP addresses to locate the destination.
- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP):** A protocol which allows webpages to be shared across different computers and browsers. It explains how messages are set up and sent between web browsers and servers.
- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) :** HTTPS is a more secure version of HTTP. It helps keep information safe when you use the internet. It uses encryption methods such as SSL/TLS. This

{46}------------------------------------------------

- coding makes your information unreadable to anyone trying to steal it. Finally, authentication is used to verify the website's identity.
- **File Transfer Protocol (FTP):** Is normally used for transfer files between client and server.
- **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP):** SMTP is the standard protocol for sending emails across the internet.
- **Post Office Protocol (POP3):** POP is used to receive emails from a remote server. They are downloaded to a local email client and are viewed offline.
- **Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP):** IMAP enables emails to be downloaded from the server to multiple client devices. However, unlike POP, the email can be set to remain on the server after being downloaded.
- **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP):** BGP stands for Border Gateway Protocol. It is a system used to share information about the best routes for data to travel on the Internet.
- **Domain Name System (DNS):** DNS changes website domain names into IP addresses that computers use to find each other. This is important for using the internet because it makes it easier to find websites.

**Packet switching and the typical contents of a TCP/IP packet** A packet is a unit of data that is transmitted over a network. When data is sent, it is segmented into smaller packets. These packets travel through the network independently to the destination computer, where they are reassembled in the correct order.

Segmenting the data into packets enhances efficiency and reliability. In the event of a network issues, routers dynamically find alternative routes for the packets to travel. If a packet is lost, the receiving computer will request for a re-transmission of the lost packet.

#### **Packet Content**

#### **Cost calculation of routing data on a network**

• Routing Cost: A way to measure and determine the best path to a destination on a network.

Network hardware devices store measurements of network routing costs, there are various routing costs that can be stored, the most common are:

- **Bandwidth Cost:** The data transfer capacity of a link. Routing protocol may prefer higher bandwidths.
- **Delay Cost:** The time it takes for a packet to travel from the source to the destination. Lower delay is generally preferred
- **Hop Count:** The number of networks or nodes a packet must pass through to reach the destination.
- **Load Cost:** The amount of traffic over a network link. Routing decisions may consider the load to avoid congestion.
- **Reliability Cost:** The error rate of a link; more stable links are preferred in routing decisions.

#### **The evolution of communication networks:**

- **Traditional Telecommunication Systems**:
  - Telegraph and Telephone: These systems marked the beginning of communication networks, enabling point-to-point communication through electrical signals transmitted over wires.
  - PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network): Used for landline phones, PSTN is based on circuit-switching, where a dedicated connection is made for each call. Voice communication is carried via analogue signals.
  - Dial-up Internet: Early internet access used telephone lines with limited speeds (up to 56 kbps). Since dial-up shared the phone

{49}------------------------------------------------

line, telephone calls could not be made at same time.

#### • **Broadband Technology** :

- ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line): An improvement over dial -up, ADSL provides faster internet speeds and continuous access without interrupting the phone line. It uses the same telephone line but separates voice and data into different frequency channels.
- Cable Broadband: This technology delivers internet coaxial cables originally intended for TV, offering greater bandwidth and higher speeds than ADSL.

#### • **Fibre Optics and High -Speed Networks**

- : • Fibre Optic Networks: Fibre -optic cables transmit data as light, providing much faster speeds and greater bandwidth than traditional copper -based systems. They form the foundation of modern broadband, enabling high -speed services like FTTH (Fibre to the Home).
- 4G/5G Mobile Networks: Wireless networks have advanced, with 4G and now 5 G enabling high -speed internet on mobile devices. 5G offers ultra -low latency, higher speeds, and supports a vast number of connected devices (IoT).

#### • **Wi -Fi :**

• Wi -Fi Evolution: Wireless local area networks (WLANs) have evolved from early Wi -Fi 802.11 standards with limited range and speed to the modern Wi -Fi 6, which provides faster speeds, reduces network congestion, and enhances connectivity in crowded areas.

#### • **Emerging Trends** :

- Low Earth Orbit Satellites: Initiatives like Starlink and OneWeb aim to deliver high -speed broadband via satellites : by orbiting the earth at lower heights makes for higher speeds and lower latency.
- 6G and Beyond: Research into 6G networks is progressing, promising even faster speeds, lower latency, and the potential to support cutting -edge technologies.

#### 1.3.2 Cybersecurity and personal privacy

Learners should know the characteristics and definitions of threats to computer systems, including:

- malware such as viruses, trojan horses, ransomware, worms and spyware
- social engineering such as phishing, pretexting, baiting, quid pro quo and impersonation
- brute force attacks such as simple brute force, dictionary attacks, hybrid brute force, reverse brute force and credential stuffing
- denial of service attacks such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), volume-based attacks, protocol attacks and application-layer attacks
- data interception and theft such as man-in-themiddle (MiTM) attacks, packet sniffing, keylogging, session hijacking and IP spoofing
- SQL injection such as error-based, unionbased, blind Boolean-based and blind timebased.

Learners should be aware of the legal and ethical aspects of network security, including privacy concerns related to data transmission over networks.

Learners should know the purpose of different methods of protecting against threats during system design, creation, testing and use, including:

- penetration testing
- network forensics
- anti-malware software

Online networks are vital for business communication and data management but are vulnerable to attacks aimed at accessing sensitive data.

Ensuring data is secure and free from loss or corruption is essential for business reputation and legal implications. Cybersecurity are the methods and measures a business will use to safeguard computer systems, networks and data from unauthorised access or cyberattacks.

Cyberattacks typically involve different forms of malware, also known as malicious software. There are various types:

#### **Malware:**

- **Viruses**: A computer program that can copy itself onto other programs often with the intention of maliciously damaging data. Transmitted by 'piggybacking' on another program known as a 'vector'.
- **Trojan horse:** this malware that pretends to be harmless but contains harmful code. It tricks users into activating it, allowing unauthorised activities. Once installed it can create range of issues, from stealing data, providing a backdoor to cyber criminals who wish to gain remote access or the monitoring of activity on a system. This type of malware can sit undetected without appropriate protection and monitoring.
- **Ransomware:** software that will restrict the access of data or systems to the user unless a ransom is paid. This is often done through encryption, blocking, or locking the data.
- **Worms:** malware, like a virus, but is a standalone program that replicates itself to spread to other computers. It does not need a vector. This will find vulnerabilities in the system and then replicate itself to attack these vulnerabilities. They will then corrupt, delete or install back door access.
- **Spyware:** Malware that secretly monitors a user's activities, collecting information without user consent or knowledge. Usually installed by opening attachments or downloading infected software. It can track browsing habits, messages and keystrokes using Keyloggers.

{51}------------------------------------------------

- firewalls
- user access levels
- passwords
- backups
- Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
- secure by design
- encryption.

Keyloggers can be used to track keystrokes and therefore capture passwords and account numbers for fraudulent use.

**Social engineering** is the method of capturing data and information by manipulating information out of people due to naivety or human error. There are various methods of social engineering, including:

- **Phishing:** the method of gathering information from a recipient of a text, email or phone call by pretending to be a legitimate company. Phishing documents will often have telltale signs that ask the recipient to give private information as a matter of urgency.
- **Pretexting:** the act of setting up the context of a fictious story to make the user more likely to believe a phishing attack scenario. This may not always be done via the computer but can be done in person by pretending to be someone from a legitimate company.
- **Baiting:** the act of luring a recipient into giving out information or installing malware by clicking on or installing software by giving an incentive. This could be something as simple as entry to a competition or something free if they click on the link.
- **Quid pro quo:** the act of convincing the recipient to give information not for financial gain or because they will receive something, but because the recipient is made to feel that they are being helpful. This method of social engineering is done by effective social skills of manipulation to make the recipient feel like they are doing the right thing.
- **Impersonation:** when the attacker pretends to be a friend, colleague or employee of a business to get the recipient to give out private information to gain access to accounts or data.

In addition to accessing data and information through malware and social engineering, cybersecurity issues can occur through **brute force attacks.**  This is a form of hacking that uses trial and error to correctly find out login details, passwords and encryption keys. There are various ways these attacks can take place, such as:

• **dictionary attacks:** a method of trying to work out passwords or encryption keys by using common dictionary wors or word lists

{52}------------------------------------------------

- **hybrid brute force:** a combination of a traditional brute force attack and a dictionary attack
- **reverse brute force:** this type of attack is when commonly used passwords are used against username and login details to gain access to accounts
- **credential stuffing:** uses stolen username and password details to try and access other accounts using the same credentials .

**Denial of service attacks** is a method of attack that attempts to render the system unusable or unavailable for a period of time. This is often done by overloading the system with requests that it is unable to handle and thus the system will effectively crash on the server side.

- **Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS):** This method will send requests frequently and simultaneously from different systems to the same location to effectively overwhelm the system.
- **Volume -based attacks :** This type of attack focusses on volume of data being sent in order to overwhelm the system or server. The concept is to exhaust the bandwidth to it and thus rendering it usable.
- **Protocol attacks :** This method looks for vulnerabilities in the communication protocols of the protocol stack. The aim is to overwhelm specific resources such as firewalls to make the server and system redundant.
- **Application -layer attacks :** These attacks focus on the application layer of communication and thus stop the webserver communicating with the users. Ther are various types of application -layer attacks such as: low and slow, HTTP(s) flooding and BGP hijacking .

**Data Interception and theft** is the process of the capturing of sensitive data at the point it is transmitted over a network. There are various ways of these cyber -attacks taking place including the following:

- **Man -in -the -middle (MiTM) attacks:** This method of attacks finds weaknesses in the communication channel between server and user and will intercept the data being sent.
- **Packet sniffing :** This method of attack will intercept packets being

{53}------------------------------------------------

sent along a communication network, regardless of their destination. These packets are then analysed, and the information is used to gather data. Packet sniffing is only able to analyse packets that are either unencrypted or with weak encryption. There are two types of packet sniffing, active and passive.

- **Keylogging :** The process of monitoring keystrokes on a keyboa rd without the user 's awareness so that sensitive data can be tracked, such as usernames, account information and passwords.
- **Session hijacking :** This method of attack uses sessions between the user and the server. It sniffs out sessions and then gains access to the session ID or cookies that allows the attacker to act as the user. Once the session ID has been accessed the attacker can continue to access the system with the appropriate level off access as if they were the user as long as the session ID stays active.
- **IP spoofing :** IP address spoofing involves an attacker changing the IP address of a legitimate host so that a visitor who types in the URL of a legitimate site is taken to a fraudulent or spoofed web page. The attacker can then use the hoax page to steal sensitive data, such as a credit card number, or install malware.

**SQL Injection** a technique where malicious users can inject SQL commands into an SQL statement, via web page input. Injected SQL commands can alter SQL statements and compromise the security of information held in a database.

- **Error-based:** This technique relies on producing an error in the database to extract information. The attacker will manipulate an SQL query to generate an error message that reveals sensitive information, such as database structure, table names, and column names. This approach is effective when the web application displays detailed error messages that can be used to gather information about the database.
- **Union -based :** These attacks use the "UNION" SQL operator to combine the results of two or more database tables, which allows them to retrieve data from other database tables . These can only

{54}------------------------------------------------

work effectively if they are designed in the same way as the original query in the code. The query sent by the attacker must have the correct name, number and correct data types for each column. The best way for attackers to get this correct information is when the system has error reporting enabled to allow the attacker to work out the structure based on errors.

- **Blind Boolean -based :** similar to union -based SQL injection this attack tries to extract information about the server's database. In this instance though , the extraction is based on extracting information using the responses from Boolean queries and will gather information based on the True or False responses .
- **Blind time -based :** In time -based attacks, attackers use a trick where they make the website delay or slow down its response to help them figure out if their guesses were correct. Blind time -based SQL injection is important because it can be used to get secret information from a website, even if the website doesn't directly show anything back. By patiently sending commands and observing the delays, attackers can slowly reveal hidden data .

Learners should understand all the laws and regulations associated with the protection of privacy of data transmitted across a network, including the following:

- UK- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018)
- Computer Misuse Act 1990
- Telecommunications (Security) Act 2021
- Investigatory Powers Act 2016 (IPA)
- Digital Economy Act 2017

#### **Methods of protecting against threats based on the different stages of development:**

- **Design:**
  - Secure by design is an approach to software and hardware development where security is a core focus from the very

{55}------------------------------------------------

- beginning of the design process. Instead of adding security features after a product is developed, secure by design ensures that systems are built with security in mind at every stage.
- Firewalls can be integrated during the design and development stage. Thinking about firewalls early in the design stage, developers can design the system with better security measures in mind. Security features can be built directly into the system rather than added on later, which is more efficient and effective.
- User access levels refer to the different permissions or privileges that are assigned to users within a system based on their roles or needs. These levels help ensure that users only have access to the resources and information that are necessary for their role, reducing the risk of accidental or malicious misuse.
- Multifactor Authentication (MFA) is a security process that requires users to provide two or more forms of verification to gain access to a system or service. This adds an extra layer of protection beyond just a password.

#### • **Creation:**

- Anti-malware software in the software development process is to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software (malware) such as viruses, ransomware, spyware, and trojans.
- Firewalls during software development is to control and monitor network traffic, ensuring that only authorised data and applications can access the development environment.
- Encryption is essential in the software development process for protecting data by converting it into a code that only authorised users can read or decrypt.
- Implement endpoint protections involves securing all devices (endpoints) that connect to the network during software development, such as computers, laptops or servers.

#### • **Testing:**

• Penetration testing during software testing simulates real -world cyberattacks on the software or system to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. The purpose is to

{56}------------------------------------------------

- identify security weaknesses, evaluate the effectiveness of defences and provide results from the testing that will make suggestions for improvements.
- Network forensics will analyse network traffic and logs identify and investigate suspicious activities, security breaches or anomalies that may occur within a system. The main purpose and processes during network forensics include : monitoring and capturing network data, tracing the source of the attack and ensure compliance with security protocols, such as encryption and secure communications.

#### • **Use :**

- Monitoring systems will continue to track systems performance and user activity to detect unusual behaviour or security issues in real time. This will then generate an alert when potential security breaches occur.
- Secure supply chains ensure that all software, hardware, and third -party components used in a system are trustworthy and free from malicious tampering. This will reduce the risk of vulnerabilities being introduced into a system from external components.
- Conduct security audits involve regularly reviewing and assessing a system's security policies, configurations, and procedures to ensure compliance with best practices and identify vulnerabilities. These audits help confirm that data protection measures are working as intended and uncover areas where security can be improved.
- Anti -malware software scans, detects, and removes malicious software that could compromise system security and data integrity. It provides real -time protection by actively monitoring files, downloads, and network traffic for any signs of malware.
- User access levels determine what data and system functionalities each user can access, based on their role. Only authorised users can view or modify sensitive data, reducing the risk of accidental or intentional data breaches.

{57}------------------------------------------------

- Firewalls act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks. They monitor and filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules, blocking unauthorised access while allowing legitimate communication.
- Passwords are a primary method of user authentication, ensuring that only authorised individuals can access the system. Secure password practices, such as using strong, unique passwords and regularly updating them, protect user accounts from unauthorised access.
- Backups create copies of important data and store them in secure locations, ensuring that information can be restored in case of data loss due to hardware failure, cyberattacks, or accidental deletion.
- Multifactor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to verify their identity through multiple forms of authentication, such as a password, a security token, or biometrics.
- Create an incident response plan outlines the steps an organisation should take in the event of a security breach or cyberattack. It helps ensure a swift and coordinated response, minimising damage and reducing the risk of data loss.
- Software updates fix security vulnerabilities and bugs that could be exploited by attackers. Regular updates are essential for maintaining the security and stability of any system. Keeping software up to date ensures that known weaknesses are patched, preventing cyber -attacks from exploiting outdated systems to gain access to data.
- Encryption secures data by converting it into a code that only authorised users can decrypt and read. It protects sensitive information, both when stored and when transmitted over networks , ensuring data can only be read with the correct encryption key. Encryption can be asymmetric or symmetric.

**Self-documenting identifiers:** using variable names that describe what the variable contains is important. Poor variable names can make it difficult to work out what is going on in a program. Sub-program/ function names should describe what the function does. 'Function2' is not a suitable name for a function used to calculate an average score, 'calcAverage' would be more appropriate.

**Subroutines** is a program unit/module that performs a particular task. These subroutines are merged to form larger programs and can be called by the main program or other subroutines. This method of programming is in modular design. Subroutines can be either functions or procedures.

**Inputs and Outputs:** when writing algorithms there is often a need to receive inputs at the beginning to assign value to variables. This can be done through terminology such as input("Enter name") name. Outputs will often be found throughout the algorithm when calculations have been completed and need to display to the user. Output will often appear towards the end of the algorithm. This can be done through terminology such as print("Average: ") average or output(average("average").

**Sequence** is a set of instructions that are processed one after another. For example, asking for two pieces of data to be inputted.

**Selection** is the process of decision making. So, the next instruction will be executed based on a certain condition. This process is normally completed using if statements or switch statements such as case select.

**Iteration** is the process of repeating instructions based on a condition. This can be either a set number of loops or until a condition is met. The most common iteration processes are for and while loops. For the loop to be exited there may be either a count or a rogue value to terminate the loop.

{61}------------------------------------------------

**Counts** are variables used to count values to satisfy certain conditions. An incremental count is one that usually counts upwards by one and can be shown as count = count + 1.

**Rogue Values** is the value that is entered into a loop for it to terminate. This value must be a value which would not normally arise. Example: grade = -1

**String Handling** is the dealing with the string data type in programming. A string can be manipulated to either extract information or to alter it based on a range of operations.

There are many different types of operations that can be used within a programming language. Here are some examples and their python equivalent.

| Operation  | Meaning                                                                                     | Python code  |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Capitalise | Converts the first character to upper case. | capitalize() |
| Count | Returns the number of times a given value occurs in a string. | count("a") |
| Find | Searches a string for a given value and returns the position of where it was found | find("a") |
| Format | Formats specified values in a string | format() |
| Lowercase | Converts a string into lower case | lower() |

{62}------------------------------------------------

| Left trim | Returns a left trim version of the string | lstrip() |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Replace | Returns a string where a specified value is replaced with a specified value | replace() |
| Right trim | Returns a right trim version of the string | rstrip() |
| Split | Splits the string at the specified separator, and returns a list | split() |
| Split Line | Splits the string at line breaks and returns a list | splitlines() |
| Strip | Returns a trimmed version of the string | strip() |
| Uppercase | Converts a string into upper case | upper() |

| Integer division Finds the quotient or the 'whole number of times' a divisor can be divided into a number. | 21 DIV 4 = 5 The quotient is 5 as 4 divides into 21 a whole number of 5 times. |  |
| Modulo division Finds the remainder when a divisor is divided into a number. | 21 MOD 2 = 1 The remainder is 1 as 2 divides 10 times into 21 with a remainder of 1. |  |

| AND | Both statements must be true for the argument as a whole to be true | (A == 1) AND (B==4) will return TRUE if A is 1 and B is 4. It would return FALSE in all other situations. |
| NOT | The opposite of True input. | NOT(A) will return TRUE if A is FALSE and FALSE if A is TRUE. |
| OR | Only one of the statements needs to be true for the argument as a whole to be true. | (A==1) OR (B==4) will return TRUE if A is 1 or B is 4. It would only return FALSE if A is not 1 and B is not 4. |
| XOR | The argument is false if both statements are true. The argument is false if both statements are false. Otherwise, the statement is true. | A XOR B would return TRUE if A and B are different values. |

**Local variables** are declared in a sub-procedure. They have 'local scope' because they can only be accessed from within that subprocedure.

**Global variables** are declared in the main program, outside of subprocedures. They have 'global scope' because they can be accessed from all parts of the program.

{65}------------------------------------------------

- **1-D arrays** are linear data structures that can be defined as such myArray[6]. This would mean that the array has 6 elements within it. The first element will be located in position myArray[0].
- **2-D arrays** are data structures that are made up of rows and tables, that can be defined as such myArray[6, 5]. This would mean that the array has 6 elements in rows and 5 in columns. The first element will be located in position myArray[0, 0].

#### **Characteristics of search algorithms:**

• **Linear search** will search through a data structure sequentially. Array data structures will be search in a linear fashion. Linear searches can be performed by unsorted data structures.

```
Declare linearSearch(dataList, searchItem) 
position = 0 
found = false 
while position < len(dataList) and found = false 
 if dataList[position] = searchItem then 
 found = true 
 else 
 position = position + 1 
 end if 
end while
```

• **Binary search** will find the midpoint of a data structure and compare that element against the search item. If the search item is not found it will discard the half of the data structure that will not contain the search item and repeat the process of finding the midpoint. It will repeat all processes until the search item is found. This search can only be done on sorted data structures.

```
searchChar is char 
first is integer
```

{66}------------------------------------------------

```
last is integer 
midpoint is integer
myArray[] is char[] 
input searchChar 
set first = 0 
set last = len(myArray[])- 1 
repeat 
 set midpoint = (first + last)/2 
 if searchChar < myArray[midpoint] then 
 set last = midpoint – 1 
 else 
 set first = midpoint + 1 
 end if 
until (myArray[midpoint] = searchChar) 
output myArray[midpoint]
```

#### **Characteristics of sorting algorithms:**

• **Bubble sort** is ideal for sorting data that is nearly sorted data structures. Bubble sorts will compare two elements next to each other. If they are not in correct order, they will then swap the two elements. It will then move onto next element in the data structure. Once it has reached the end of the file it will return to the start and repeat the process until all elements are sorted into the correct order.

```
Declare BubbleSort(bubbleList): 
 exchanges = True 
 passnum = len(bubbleList)-1 
 while passnum > 0 and exchanges = True 
 exchanges = False 
 for i = 1 to n
```

{67}------------------------------------------------

```
 if bubbleList[i]>bubbleList[i+1]: 
 exchanges = True 
 temp = bubbleList[i] 
 bubbleList[i] = bubbleList[i+1] 
 bubbleList[i+1] = temp 
 end if next i 
 passnum = passnum-1 
 end while end Subroutine 
bubbleList=[20,30,40,90,50,60,70,80,100,110]
BubbleSort(bubbleList) 
print(bubbleList)
• Selection sort is the process of splitting the array into unsorted and 
  sorted and moving the smallest element of the unsorted part of the 
  array into the correct position of the sorted array. This is an efficient 
  sorting method that uses iteration to repeat the process until all 
  elements are sorted.
min is integer
n is integer
n = length(Array)
for i = 1 to n 
min = i
 for j = i+1 to n 
 if (Array[j] < Array[min]) then 
 min = j
 swap(Array[i] and Array[min])
 end if
 next j
next i
```

{68}------------------------------------------------

• **Insertion sort** will use a linear search to find the location in the sorted portion where the first element of the unsorted portion should be inserted. It will store this unsorted element into temporary storage. It will then move all the elements after the insertion location up one position to make space for the new element. This process is repeated until all items are sorted.

```
myArray[0 … 999] is string 
i is integer
j is integer
currentItem is integer 
for i = 0 to len(myArray) – 1 
 currentItem = myArray[i] 
 set j = i 
 while (j > 0 and myArray[j – 1] > 
currentItem)
 myArray[j] = myArray[j – 1] 
 set j = j - 1 
 endwhile 
 myArray[j] = currentItem 
next i
```

#### **Data Validation**

Validation is an automatic computer check to ensure that the data entered is sensible and reasonable. It does not check the accuracy of data.

• **Type check:** checks something of the correct data type is entered. E.g. a date in a date field or a number in a number field.

```
x is int
input("Enter a number")x
if type(x) is int
```

{69}------------------------------------------------

```
 print("x is an integer") 
else
 print("x is not an integer")
end if
```

• **Range check:** checks something is within a specific range. E.g. an order quantity is between 1 and 10, > 18years old, or <21 etc

```
age is int
input("Enter your age") age
if age >= 18 then
 print("You are old enough to enter the site")
else
 print("You must be 18 to enter the site")
end if
```

• **Presence check:** checks that something is there. E.g. Mandatory field. Makes sure REQUIRED fields are entered often marked with \*

```
name as string
Input(Please enter your name") name
if name = "" then
 print("This cannot be left blank")
else
 print("Welcome" & name)
end if
```

• **Format check:** checks what is entered is of the correct structure. E.g. Postcode (LLNN NLL) E.g. TS23 3DX.

```
Def Sub is_valid_postcode(postcode)
postcode_pattern = "^[A-Z]{1,2}[0-9][0-9]?[A-Z]?[ 
]?[0-9][A-Z]{2}$"
postcode is string
```

{70}------------------------------------------------

```
input("Enter postcode")postcode
if postcode matches postcode_pattern then
 print("Valid postcode")
else
 print("Valid postcode")
end if
```

• **Length check:** Ensures that information is of a specified length. E.g. a mobile number field may be more than 11 characters. If it is less or more, it would not be accepted.

```
telephone is string
input("Enter telephone number")telephone
telephone_Length = telephone.length
if telephone.length < 11 OR >14 then
 print("This is not the correct number of 
characters for telephone number")
end if
```

#### **Data Verification**

Verification is performed to ensure that the data entered exactly matches the original source.

• **Double Keying/Entry Verification:** Entering the same data twice and then checking both versions are the same. Asking user to input re-enter password to ensure the user has inputted it correctly.

```
password is string
re_password is string
input("please enter a password")password
input("Please confirm password")re_password
if password <> re_password then
```

{71}------------------------------------------------

```
 print("Passwords do not match")
   else
    print("Thank you for submitting password")
   end if
• Visual Checking Verification: Checking the data entered with the 
   original document to ensure they are the same. This could be done by 
   asking user to confirm the information before submitting information. 
   username is string
   confirm is boolean
   input("Please enter your username")username
   input("Is this the correct username")confirm
   if confirm = True then
    print("Thank you for confirming")
   else
    print("Please enter the correct username")
   Eend if
```

### 1.5.2 Software development lifecycle (SDLC) Learners should know the principles of project management, including: • project initiation and planning • project execution and monitoring • project control and evaluation. Learners should understand the stages of software development, including: • planning and analysis: "Investigation" • design • development and implementation • testing • deployment • maintenance, support and refinement. Learners should be aware of the legal, ethical and social consideration surrounding software development.

- encapsulation
- cohesion and low coupling.

Good principles are essential to the success of any project. They provide a structured approach to planning, executing, monitoring and completion.

- **Project Initiation and Planning**: Define the project's objectives, scope, stakeholders, and resources. Plan thoroughly, breaking down tasks and estimating costs, schedules, and risks.
- **Project Execution and Monitoring**: Manage resources and coordinate tasks to achieve project goals. Continuously monitor performance and take corrective actions to stay on track.
- **Project Control and Evaluation**: Evaluate performance, adjust as needed, and formally close the project. Document lessons learned to improve future project efforts.

The stages of software development:

- **Planning and analysis: "Investigation":** During this stage, the focus is on the understanding of the scope of the problem, the requirements and the feasibility. During this stage there is a need for the gathering of information through investigation. This can be done by liaising with stakeholders, through interviews, surveys and observations. Analysts might also look at existing data and the flow of data. A feasibility study will take place to analyse whether the project is feasible in terms of technical, financial and operational aspects. Finally, a scope definition and risk analysis are completed to determine the objectives of the project and identifying potential risks, such as resource limitations and technical challenges.
- **Design:** During this stage, the system is designed based on the requirements. This stage is the start of the technical design of the system. This stage includes developing the Specification Design Document (SDD) made by the architects. It can contain detailed designs, data structures, interface design, flow of data and prototyping.
- **Development and implementation:** During this stage, the code is written by the software developers in line with the requirements of the

{74}------------------------------------------------

- project. During this stage code is written, version control, unit testing and finally integration of modules into one unified system.
- **Testing:** This is crucial for the reliability and quality of the software. This stage focusses on fixing bugs and testing the validation of the software, ensuring that it works as intended. There will be a range of testing strategies including functional, integration, unit and acceptance testing.
- **Deployment:** This is the process of taking it from the development stage and making it available to the end user. This stage is crucial and requires careful management to ensure a smooth transition.
- **Maintenance, support and refinement:** Once the system is live and has been fully deployed the maintenance support and refinement stage starts. This is an ongoing support that involves bug fixes, updates, performance optimisation, security updates and support.

Learners should be aware of the legal, ethical and social consideration surrounding software development.

#### **Legal Considerations:**

- **Intellectual Property (IP):** Developers must ensure they respect IP laws, including copyright, patents, and trademarks.
- **Data Protection and Privacy Laws:** Software handling personal or sensitive data must comply with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA).
- **Licensing Agreements:** Software developers must adhere to the terms of software licenses, whether creating open -source, proprietary, or commercial software. Misuse of licensed content can result in legal consequences.
- **Liability and Accountability:** Developers must consider legal accountability for defects, bugs, or security vulnerabilities in their software that could lead to damage or harm.

{75}------------------------------------------------

#### **Ethical Considerations:**

- **Security and User Safety:** Developers have an ethical responsibility to create secure software that protects users from threats like hacking, data breaches, or misuse of personal data. Ignoring security concerns can harm users.
- **Transparency and Honesty:** Ethical developers are transparent about how their software works, especially concerning data collection and usage.
- **Bias and Fairness:** Developers must ensure that software, especially algorithms does not have built -in biases that discriminate against certain groups based on race, gender, or other factors.
- **User Consent:** It's important to obtain user consent when collecting personal data, and users should be informed clearly about what data is being collected, why, and how it will be used.
- **Sustainability:** Ethical software development should consider the environmental impact, including the energy efficiency of the software and its contribution to e -waste, especially in hardware -dependent applications.

#### **Social Considerations:**

- **Access and Digital Divide**: Developers should consider the impact of their software on different communities, ensuring it is accessible to users regardless of their socio -economic background, disability, or location.
- **Impact on Jobs and Society:** Automation and software advancements can disrupt industries and reduce the need for certain jobs, raising ethical concerns about their impact on employment and society. Developers should consider the social impact of their innovations.
- **Content Moderation:** For platforms that host user -generated content (e.g., social media), developers must implement tools and policies for content moderation to prevent the spread of harmful content.
- **Freedom and Control:** Social considerations include ensuring that users have control over their data and experience, rather than feeling

These languages have two key characteristics: They include a set of predefined keywords, such as or IF. They follow specific grammar rules (syntax) that are PRINT language specific. High-level source code must be translated into machine code before it can be executed by the CPU. Languages such as Python, Java, and C# are widely used for developing applications for smartphones, computers, and the web. This means you can write the code once, and it will function across multiple platforms. These languages simplify the process by offering shortcuts, pre-built tools, libraries, and subroutines. High-level languages are commonly chosen for prototyping or testing new software ideas because they allow for faster development and require less focus on intricate technical details. Low-level languages There are two main types of low-level language: machine code and assembly language. Machine code consists of instructions that are executed directly by the CPU and are made up of bit patterns. Typically, a machine code instruction is represented as an 8-bit binary value, such as 10110101. However, this format is not human-friendly, making it difficult to understand what the instruction does. |

{77}------------------------------------------------

Different CPUs use unique binary codes to represent specific instructions, meaning machine code written for one CPU will not work on another without being rewritten.

Assembly language consists of a relatively small set of command words known as mnemonics, designed to be more memorable. This is much more user -friendly compared to raw machine code. For example, the LDA command loads data, while the ADD command performs addition. Low -level languages, like assembly, are commonly used for system programming tasks that require direct hardware access or fine control over memory management. These tasks include writing device drivers, operating systems, and embedded systems software.

Low -level languages are also chosen for performance -critical applications, such as real -time systems, and are often employed in embedded systems where memory and performance requirements are strict.

#### **Compilers**

A compiler converts high -level languages into machine executable code in one go.

Compilers check for errors in the code before turning it into machine code. If there are mistakes, it will point them out, and an error message will be outputted. Some compilers can improve the code to make it run faster or use less memory using optimisation.

Advantages of compilers:

- programs compiled into machine code usually run faster than those not compiled, because the computer executes the machine code directly
- compilers can catch mistakes in the code before you try to run it, saving you time and frustration
- many compilers optimise the code, making the final program more

efficient

• protects the intellectual property of the code as this cannot be viewed once it is compiled.

#### Disadvantages of compilers:

- compiling a program can take time, especially for large applications. This means it can be a bit slow before you even run your program
- code that is compiled for one type of computer might not work on another without being recompiled.

#### **Interpreters**

An interpreter is a type of tool used in computer programming that translates code written in a programming language into machine code , line by line. This means that instead of building a program all at once, the interpreter reads and executes the code one instruction at a time.

#### Advantages of interpreters:

- since interpreters execute code line by line, it's easier to spot and fix errors right where they occur
- code is more portable as it is not machine dependent as it has not been translated to machine code.

#### Disadvantages of interpreters:

- an interpreter translates code line by line, running interpreted code can be slower than running compiled code
- interpreted programs may not run as efficiently as those compiled into machine code, especially for larger, more complex applications
- to run the code on a computer, you must have the right interpreter installed, which could limit portability.

#### **Assemblers**

An assembler is a special program that translates assembly language, which is a low -level programming language, into machine code that a computer can understand. An assembler is often tailored to work with specific hardware. It is usually efficient and uses minimal resources.

{79}------------------------------------------------

#### **Principle stages of compilation process :**

- Lexical analysis :
  - Lexical analysis is the process in which the source program's stream of characters is read from left to right and organised into tokens.
  - Tokens are sequences of characters that represent a single unit of meaning.
  - During lexical analysis, other tasks like removing comments, ignoring white space between tokens, and handling features like macros may also be performed for convenience.
  - A symbol table is generated during this stage, which stores the addresses of variables, labels, and subroutines.
- Syntax analysis :
  - Syntax involves parsing which is analysing the sequence of tokens to identify the program's syntactic structure.
  - The tokens are checked against the expected spelling and grammar based on the language's standard definitions.
  - If any syntax errors are detected, error messages are generated .
- Semantic analysis :
  - This phase conducts semantic checks, such as verifying data types and ensuring definite assignment confirming that all local variables are initialised before use.
  - It ensures that variables are properly declared and used, and verifies that they are of the correct data type .
  - Checks that operations are valid for the type of variable involved.
- Code generation :
  - Machine code is generated .
- Code optimisation :
  - Code optimisation may be employed to make it more efficient/faster/less resource intense .

#### **Programming Errors**

There are various errors that can occur during the programming development, these are usually identified during testing or the compilation process.

- **Logical:** An error that causes a program to output an incorrect answer (that does not necessarily crash the program). Example: Adding two numbers together instead of taking them away.
- **Runtime:** An error that only occurs when the program is running and is difficult to foresee before a program is compiled and run. Example: Dividing a value by 0.
- **Syntax:** An error that occurs when a command does not follow the expected syntax of the language, e.g. when a keyword is incorrectly spelt. Examples: 'edn if' instead of 'end if'
- **Linking:** An error that occurs when a programmer calls a function within a program and the correct library has not been linked to that program. Example: When the square root function is used and the library that calculates the square root has not been linked to the program
- **Rounding:** Rounding is when a number is approximated to nearest whole number/tenth/hundredth. Example: 34.5 rounded to nearest whole number is 35, an error of +0.5.
- **Truncating:** Truncating is when a number is approximated to a whole number/tenth/hundredth. Example: 34.9 truncated to whole number is 34, an error of –0.9.

- Boolean algebra, developed by George Boole in the mid-19th century, became essential for the creation of digital circuits and computing systems.
- These logical operations advanced and became pivotal to the operation of modern digital devices.
- Boolean can be used for basic decision-making functions in early computers.
- They are also used for more sophisticated processes found in today's processors and algorithms.

Learners should be aware of:</li><li>legal and ethical considerations related to security features in operating systems</li><li>user privacy concerns in the context of OS design.</li></ul> | Operating systems (OS) are essential in making all computer systems work. It helps manage the hardware and software on devices. It helps manage the user interface; it provides a way for users to communicate with the computer. Resource Management makes sure that all components, like memory and processing power, are used efficiently. It also helps to protect your computer from unauthorised access. The operating system also manages the following: <ul><li>CPU: The OS ensures that the CPU has the right tasks to perform at the right time.</li><li>Multi-tasking: Multi-tasking is when you can work on several things at once. The OS helps manage multiple programmes running at the same time without slowing down your device. The OS handles this by time-slicing, switching between tasks making tasks seem to like they are running seamlessly.</li><li>Interrupts: External devices, such as keyboard or mouse signal interrupts to the CPU. OS identifies the interrupt type and calls the corresponding interrupt handler. CPU switches from the current task to the interrupt handler. Handler executes required actions. CPU restores saved task state and resumes previous execution.</li><li>The OS manages the RAM by allocating space within the Memory: RAM to different applications and processes. It will also handle virtual memory which extends physical memory.</li><li>Backing store: The OS manages the backing store by loading, saving and the organisation of data. It also ensures files, and the file structure are stored efficiently through methods such as defragmentation on HDDs.</li><li>Peripherals: The OS handles the communication between peripheral devices. It uses device drivers to communicate with hardware by both sending and receiving data between the computer and the external device.</li></ul> |  |  |

{84}------------------------------------------------

- **Interface :** The OS provides the connection between the user and the system. There are different types of OS interfaces such as Graphical User Interface (GUI), Command Line Interface (CLI) menu driven and Mobile User Interface (MUI).
- **Security :** Many operating systems now provide additional security measures to ensure data and user security. Measures can include firewalls, encryption, virus scanning, access levels, passwords and biometric verification .

#### **Purpose and functionality of utility software :**

- **Antivirus software:** Protects against and removes malicious software to safeguard the system from security threats.
- **Backup software:** Automatically backs up data to external storage or cloud services to prevent data loss.
- **Disk cleanup:** Optimises disk space usage by removing temporary data to improve system performance.
- **Disk defragmenter:** Reorganises fragmented data to improve file access speed and overall system performance.
- **File compression/archiving software:** Compresses files and folders into a single archive format to save disk space and facilitate easier file transfer.
- **System optimisation tools:** Tweaks system settings, removes unnecessary startup programs, and optimises system resources to enhance performance.
- **Disk partitioning software:** Divides a hard drive into multiple partitions for better organisation of data and improved data management.
- **Data recovery software:** Recovers lost or deleted files, folders, and partitions from storage devices to restore lost data.
- **Network monitoring software:** Monitors network traffic and devices to identify and troubleshoot network issues and optimise performance.

{85}------------------------------------------------

#### **Data Protection Laws**

• Laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and DPA (2018). Developers of the OS must follow these laws by ensuring their operating systems store and process personal data securely.

#### **Cybercrime and Hacking**

- Security features in operating systems are designed to prevent cybercrime. Weak security can leave systems vulnerable to attacks by hackers.
- Operating systems have firewalls and antivirus tools to stop hackers from accessing your computer.

#### **User Privacy**

- Operating systems collect data for various reasons. Without proper security, this data can be exposed.
- They should be transparent about what data is collected and why. The operating system should ask for your permission before using your data and keep that information private.

#### **Security Vulnerabilities**

- If security vulnerabilities are not fixed, it could lead to data theft, financial loss, or other damages.
- It is the responsibility of developers to regularly update and patch these vulnerabilities to keep users safe.

#### **Encryption and Access Controls**

- These are crucial security features in operating systems to protect sensitive data from being accessed by unauthorised users.
- Developers must balance security and privacy when designing encryption systems. They need to ensure data is secure, while also considering how law enforcement or authorities might need access in extreme cases.

{86}------------------------------------------------

#### **Security for Vulnerable Users**

- Vulnerable users, such as the elderly, are more likely to fall victim to cyberattacks, scams, or data breaches, so the operating system needs extra safeguards.
- Developers have an ethical responsibility to ensure security features are easy to use and effective for all types of users, especially those who may not fully understand complex security settings.

#### **Transparency and Trust**

- Users need to trust that the operating system is keeping their data safe and using it responsibly.
- It's unethical for companies to hide how they collect or use data, or to create "backdoors" in the operating system that allow secret access to data.

{88}------------------------------------------------

- Administrators are those IT and system administrators who will manage maintain and secure the system. They will be dealing with troubleshooting, updates network management and system optimisation.
- Training and support will often be provided by the people that will have experience and understanding of the development of the system. These people will be t here to effectively train the users as well as provide additional support in the future should issues arise.

#### • Processes

:

- Workflow processes involve creating a structured series of tasks or actions that guide the interaction and functioning of different system components. These processes ensure that the system operates smoothly, reliably, and consistently.
- Compliance with regulations and governance standards is essential for processes. Well -designed processes incorporate checks, audits, and detailed documentation to ensure they align with legal requirements, industry standards, and internal policies.
- Automation reduces the need for human intervention, increases speed, and lowers costs by streamlining tasks. Automation tools take over routine activities, freeing up resources to focus on other areas.
- Optimisation of processes is essential for continuous improvement, with a focus on refining workflows and eliminating redundancies. This boosts efficiency, minimi ses delays, and streamlines overall operations.

#### • Data :

- **Data Management** is at the core of modern systems allowing for decision -making, analytics, and user interaction. When developing a system , efficient data management ensures the collection, storage, and retrieval of data in a way that is secure, accessible, and accurate.
- **Data Quality and Integrity** is essential for the reliability of the system. This involves validating and regularly updating data to

{89}------------------------------------------------

- prevent errors or inconsistencies that could disrupt operations or lead to poor decision -making.
- **Data Integration** provide a complete picture, by gathering data from variety of sources . For example , external systems and a variety of databases. Integration enables different system components to share data and collaborate effectively.
- **Data Analytics and Insights** is essential for system development. By using data analytics, organisations can gain valuable insights that improve decision -making, optimise operations, and enhance user experiences.
- **Data Security and Privacy** is essential in protecting data from breaches, unauthorised access, or corruption. System processes must include robust security measures, such as encryption, access controls, and compliance with privacy laws like DPA (2018) and GDPR, to safeguard sensitive data.

#### **Processes followed by developers in the SDLC**

- **:** • **Scoping and Feasibility:** This phase involves defining the project's goals, objectives, and requirements. It assesses the project's viability in terms of technical, economic, and operational factors to determine whether it should proceed.
- **Analysis:** In this stage, detailed requirements are gathered and analysed. Stakeholders' needs are documented, and existing systems are evaluated to identify gaps and opportunities for improvement, ensuring that the final system will meet user expectations.
- **Design:** The design phase focuses on creating the system architecture, user interfaces, and data models. These guide the development process, outlining how the system components will work together to fulfil the requirements of the system.
- **Implementation:** During implementation, the actual development of the system occurs. This includes coding, configuring hardware and software, and integrating various components according to the design specifications.

{90}------------------------------------------------

- **Testing:** Testing involves evaluating the system to ensure it meets the specified requirements and functions correctly. Various testing methods including unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing are planned and applied to identify and fix any issues before deployment.
- **Deployment:** In this phase, the completed system is rolled out to users. This includes installing the system conducting final checks and providing necessary training and documentation to users.
- **Maintenance:** Maintenance is the ongoing process of monitoring, updating, and improving the system after deployment. This includes fixing any issues that arise, implementing enhancements, and ensuring the system continues to meet user needs.

#### **SDLC Methods**

- **:** • **Waterfall:** This method is when each of the steps are broken down and works in a strategic linear fashion. Each step must be fully completed before moving onto the next step.
  - Strengths:
    - it uses a clear navigation and structure
    - this model is intuitive and collaborative with all team members
    - greater understanding of the requirements from the beginning of the project
    - documentation is incredibly detailed and therefore staff members can easily step into the project at different points
    - has a project specific timeframe, due to linear nature, which can be efficient
    - progress can be easily tracked as each phase has set milestones providing clear indicators of project status and help spot issues early.
  - Weaknesses :
    - difficult to make changes once the project has moved from the beginning steps
    - this method has limited collaboration with end -user or clients
    - only effective for smaller projects

{91}------------------------------------------------

- working models and testing do not take place until the latter stages
- high risk if initial requirements are misunderstood.
- **Agile :** The method breaks projects into different phases that can be iterative, and teams will frequently reflect on the development and consider any possible improvements. There is no need to complete one section before moving on and different phases or sprints can be worked on simultaneously.
  - Strengths:
    - better adapts to change and requirements
    - can detect and fix issues and errors earlier
    - work closely with the end-user and clients to ensure the system meets the requirements
    - can have a faster turnaround as not each step needs to be completed before moving on.
  - Weaknesses
    - limited documentation, making harder for new members to the team
    - harder to measure progress as progress can happen over different stages at the same time
    - n o full understanding of timescale or costing for system as it is changeable
    - the design and long -term goals can lack cohesion as the process is fragmented.
- **Iterative :** This method will build on the previous phase. This method involves continuous improvement as the focus is to trial and improve. This has less focus on research and investigation. This method allows for early development and testing.
  - Strengths:
    - will have frequent feedback and adjustments based on outcomes, testing and requirements
    - will have an early prototype of solution than can be reviewed , feedback and worked on
    - has continuous improvement and refinement .

{92}------------------------------------------------

- Weaknesses :
  - can be both resources and time intensive with lack of timescale
  - can be too iterative and get stuck developing and refining
  - not predictable, so difficult to discuss development stages with end -users and clients.
- **Spiral:** This method of project development uses both systematic and iterative processes in its phases. The project manager will decide on the number of phases. The spiral is meant to represent the iterative processes of the system within each phase .
  - Strengths :
    - software is produced early in the development process
    - provides opportunities for early prototypes or proof-ofconcepts
    - this methodology is strongest for handling risk management
    - can easily change requirements and needs during any phase
    - better for larger more complicated systems .
  - Weaknesses :
    - it is an expensive method as it requires more resources and time, therefore not suitable for smaller projects
    - increased risk of scope creep due to ongoing changes and refinements
    - can be difficult t o estimate timescale on the project due to the iterative element
    - requires higher level of expertise due to the need to consider the risk management elements
    - can have fewer comprehensive documents.

#### **Professional considerations related to industry standards for software development :**

- Code Quality and Clean Coding :
  - Other developers or teams may need to work on the same code. If the code is clear and well -structured, it's easier to fix bugs, add new features, and avoid mistakes.

{93}------------------------------------------------

- Developers follow guidelines like using meaningful variable names, proper indentation, and writing comments to explain complex parts of the code.
- Version Control :
  - Using a system to track changes made to the code over time, like using *Git* or *GitHub* helps teams work together on the same project without overwriting each other's work.
  - It also makes it easy to revert to earlier versions of the software if something goes wrong.
- Testing :
  - Writing tests to check if the software works as expected, like unit tests or integration tests ensures that the code is reliable and helps find bugs early, preventing problems in the final product.
- Security Practices
  - Developers must follow best practices, such as encrypting sensitive data, using secure passwords, and regularly updating software to fix vulnerabilities.
- User -Centred Design :
  - Creating software that is easy to use and meets the needs of its intended users.
  - Developers work with designers and users to ensure the interface is intuitive and accessible.
- Compliance with Legal Standards :

:

- Ensuring that the software complies with laws and regulations, such as data protection laws.
- Developers must understand relevant legal requirements and ensure that personal data is handled safely and appropriately.
- Collaboration and Communication :
  - Large software projects often involve many people, including developers, designers, testers, and project managers. Good communication ensures that everyone is on the same page and that the project runs smoothly.
  - Developers should attend team meetings, use collaboration tools and document their work clearly.

{94}------------------------------------------------

- Performance Optimisation :
  - Ensuring that the software runs efficiently, using the least number of resources as possible, such as memory or processing power.
  - Developers should optimise code to improve speed and reduce the amount of data processed.
- Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) :
  - A practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently and automatically deploy the software after successful testing.
  - It ensures that the software is always in a working state and allows for quicker releases of new features or bug fixes.
  - Developers use tools to automate testing and deployment and must ensure their code passes all checks before it's integrated.
- Ethical Considerations :
  - Developers are responsible for how their software is used and must consider the consequences of their work. They should ensure that the software is used for good purposes and doesn't cause harm to individuals or society.

#### **Legal and ethical considerations relating to intellectual property in software development :**

- Ethical Considerations :
  - **Privacy :** Respect user privacy, minimise data collection, and ensure that any data collected is securely stored and protected from unauthorised access.
  - **Security:** Develop software with robust security measures, including encryption and regular security audits, to protect against data breaches and cyber -attacks.
  - **Fairness:** Avoid bias and discrimination in algorithms and implement measures to ensure that all users are treated fairly, regardless of their background.
  - **Accessibility :** Make software accessible to users with disabilities by following accessibility standards and guidelines and providing alternative input and output options.
