Teacher Guidance

Computer systems require all the following components to perform a
wide range of tasks and to function correctly. Each of the
components has its own purpose.

•  Motherboard - is the main printed circuit board and the central

component that connects all other components of the computer. It
allows for communication between the CPU, RAM and memory
devices, as well as peripheral devices. Along with expansion slots
for additional RAM, graphics cards, sound cards and other
components.

•  Central Processing Unit (CPU) - is considered the brain of the
computer. It executes instructions from programs and performs
calculations necessary for the system to function. It handles all
the main processing tasks by using the fetch-decode-execute
cycle to complete program instructions.

•

•  Power Supply Unit (PSU) - converts external electrical power
into usable power for the components, ensuring the system
operates effectively and safely.
Input devices - in most instances these are components that
allow the user to interact with the computer. For example,
keyboard, mouse, touchpad, camera and microphone.
You can also have input devices that are sensors that detect
changes in the environment and convert this data into electrical
signals. For example; temperature sensors, motion sensors and
light sensors.

•  Output devices - these devices present data from the computer

to the user. For example, monitor, speakers and printer.

•

registers:
•  program counter (PC)
•  current instruction register (CIR)
•  accumulator (ACC)
•  memory address register (MAR)
•  memory data register (MDR).

Learners should know how performance of a CPU is
affected by:

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 9

•  Expansion cards – these add additional functionality to the

computer by plugging into the expansion slots on the
motherboard. They provide extra capabilities for the computer
systems. Examples include:
•  Graphic cards - responsible for rendering images, videos
and animations on the monitor. These are essential for
gaming, video editing and graphic intensive tasks.

•  Sound cards - manage the input and output of audio signals.
They improve sound quality, receive audio signals from
microphones and musical instruments and provide audio for
speakers.

•  Network Interface Card (NIC) - allows a computer to connect to

a network, such as internet or local area network (LAN):
•  Wired NICs - use cable, such as ethernet, to connect a

computer to a network

•  Wireless NICs - uses Wi-Fi technology to connect to a

network without the need for wires.

•  Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) - responsible for rendering

images, videos and animations. It processes graphical data and
is essential for tasks like gaming, video editing and 3D rendering.
There are two types of GPUs:
•

Integrated - is built into the processor chip and shares the
memory with the CPU. It uses less power than dedicated
GPUs.

•  Dedicated - has its own memory, known as VRAM, and

doesn’t share it with the CPU. It consumes more power and
has higher performance when compared to integrated GPUs.

•  Cooling Systems - provide a way of regulating the temperature
of key components, such as the CPU and GPU. This prevents
overheating and therefore damage to the components. There are
two main types:
•  Liquid Cooling - uses liquid to transfer heat away from the

components.

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 10

•  Air Cooling - uses fans and/or heat sinks to dissipate the

heat.

•  Connectivity ports allow the computer to interact with external

devices and peripherals.
•  Universal Serial Bus (USB) - used to connect external

devices like, keyboards, mice, headsets and storage devices.
USB ports are versatile and support data transfer and power
supply. USB connectors are assigned letters to indicate their
type, Type-A, Type-B, Type-C. USB ports also have numbers
included to specify the USB generation. Currently, there are
4: USB 1.x, USB 2.0, USB 3.x, and USB 4. Each generation
allows for faster transmission speeds and power delivery.
•  Display ports - connect monitors or display devices to the
system, providing high-definition video outputs. The main
display ports are VGA, DVI, HDMI and DisplayPort.
•  VGA: Older analogue video port.
•  Digital Video Interface (DVI): Supports both analogue and

digital video signals.

•  HDMI: High-definition multimedia interface for video and

audio.

•  DisplayPort: Popular for high-resolution displays.
•  Ethernet ports - allow for wired network connections,
typically used for stable and fast internet or network
connectivity.

•  Audio ports – provide connections for audio input/output
devices like headphones, microphones and speakers.
Common audio ports include:
•  3.5 mm Connector: Used for headphones, microphones,

and speakers.

•  S/PDIF / TOSLINK: For digital audio transmission.
•  RCA Connector: Commonly used for stereo audio and

video connections.

Understanding the CPU and its components is essential to grasp how
computers perform complex tasks and respond to user commands
with incredible speed and accuracy.

The CPU is the brain of the computer. Its purpose is to execute
instructions from programs, manage data, perform calculations and
control the flow of data.

Von Neumann architecture is a design model which is used in
modern computers and holds both instructions and data. Its key units
include:
•  CPU – Central Processing Unit executes instructions
•  Memory – Primary storage: Random Access Memory stores both
instructions and data. Secondary Storage: SSD, HDD store data
for retrieval at a later date.
•
Input/Output – Devices such as keyboards, mice, monitors.
•  Buses – The bus system transfers data between components.

There is the address bus, data bus and control bus

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

Each unit of the architecture contains various components:

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 12

The CPU
•  Control Unit (CU) - The control unit directs the operation of the
processor by controlling the flow of data between the CPU,
memory, and peripherals. It decodes the instruction and signals
other parts of the CPU to perform actions during the execute
phase.

•  Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) - The ALU performs all
arithmetic, such as addition and subtraction, and logical
comparison operations.

•  Registers are small, fast storage areas inside the CPU that hold

data temporarily.
The following registers are key to the fetch-decode-execute cycle:
•  Program Counter (PC) - Holds the memory address of the
next instruction to be fetched. After each fetch, the PC is
incremented to point to the next instruction.

•  Current Instruction Register (CIR) - Stores the instruction
that has just been fetched from memory and is about to be
decoded and executed.

•  Accumulator (ACC) - Temporarily holds data being used
during calculations in the ALU. It also stores the result of
operations performed by the ALU.

•  Memory Address Register (MAR) - Holds the memory

address of the data or instruction that needs to be fetched
from or written to memory.

•  Memory Data Register (MDR) - Temporarily stores the data
being fetched from or written to memory. It works in alongside
the MAR. The MDR holds the actual data being transferred to
or from the address specified by the MAR.

•  Cache memory is a small, fast memory located in or near the

CPU. It stores frequently used instructions and data to reduce the
time needed to access data from the main memory (RAM). It
speeds up the fetch process in the cycle.
There are three levels of cache:

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 13

•  Level 1: The smallest and fastest cache which is located

inside the CPU.

•  Level 2: Larger than level 1 but slower. It serves as bridge
between level 1 and level 3 or main memory (RAM). It can
either be located inside the CPU or outside, depending on the
architecture of the motherboard.

•  Level 3: Found outside the CPU. It is shared among cores,
this cache is larger and slower than L1 and L2 caches, but
faster than RAM. It helps improve performance when multiple
cores are trying to access the same data.

•  The fetch-decode-execute cycle is the basic process the CPU
uses to execute instructions. It involves fetching the instruction
from memory, decoding it, and then executing it. Each part of the
cycle is managed by a different component of the CPU. The main
operations which occur during each phase of the Fetch-Decode-
Execute cycle are:
•  Fetch phase:

•  Load the MAR with the address of the next instruction to

be executed.

•  Check if the instruction is in the cache memory. If it is,

•

fetch it directly from the cache.
If the instruction is not in the cache, fetch it from main
memory into the MDR, then transfer it to the CIR. Store
the fetched instruction in the cache.

•

Increment the PC to point to the address of the next instruction.
•  Decode phase:

•  The CU translates the instruction in the CIR.
•  The CU determines the required operations and selects
the necessary machine resources. Check the cache for
any required data. If the data is not in the cache, fetch it
from main memory into the MDR.

•  Execute phase:

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 14

•  The instruction is executed, which may involve

mathematical or logical operations in the ALU, memory
access, or I/O operations.

•  Use the ACC to store intermediate results. The MDR may
be used to transfer data between the CPU and memory.

Factors that affect CPU performance:
•  Clock speed: is the frequency with which the CPU can execute
instructions, one clock tick per second would be measured as 1
Hz. The clock speed is commonly measured in gigahertz (GHz)
which means that if there is a clock speed of 3 GHz it can
execute 3 billion instructions per second.

•  Number of cores: A core is an independent processing unit within
a CPU. Modern CPUs can have multiple cores, allowing them to
perform multiple tasks simultaneously:

•  Dual-core will have 2 cores
•  Quad-core will have 4 cores
•  Hexa-core will have 6 cores
•  Deca-core will have 10 cores
•
it is also possible to get 12, 16, 24 and 64 cores within a CPU
•  Cache size: Larger cache sizes reduce the average memory

access time; more frequently accessed data is stored closer to
the CPU cores. This allows for faster execution of instructions
since the CPU spends less time waiting for data to be fetched
from slower main memory.

•  Parallel processing: More cores enable better multitasking and
can significantly improve performance in applications designed
for parallel processing.

•  Threading: is how the processor handles and executes multiple
sequences of instructions (called threads) simultaneously. Each
thread represents a single sequence of operations that the CPU
can execute independently.

•  Single threading can only execute one thread at a time.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 15

•  Multilevel threading allows a single CPU core to manage more
than one thread at a time, which improves performance in multi-
tasking and parallel processing.

RAM
•  Temporary Storage: RAM holds data that the computer's

processor needs right now or in the near future. When you turn
off your computer, all data in RAM is lost.

•  Speed: RAM is much faster than other types of storage like hard
drives or SSDs. This speed helps your computer run smoothly
and quickly.

•  Volatile Memory: This means that RAM needs power to keep the

data. Once the power is off, the data is gone.

•  Capacity: The amount of RAM in a computer can affect its

performance. More RAM allows a computer to handle more tasks
at once without slowing down. RAM can range from gigabytes to
terabytes.
•  Types of RAM:
•  DRAM (Dynamic RAM): This is the most common type of RAM

used in computers.

•  SRAM (Static RAM): Faster and more expensive than DRAM,

used in smaller amounts for cache memory.

Buses
•  Data Bus: Carries the actual data being processed. For example,
when you open a file, the data bus transfers the file's data from
the hard drive to the RAM.

•  Address Bus: Carries information about where the data should
go. It tells the computer where to find or store data in memory.
•  Control Bus: Carries control signals that manage the operations

of the computer. These signals ensure that all parts of the
computer work together smoothly.

Legal Considerations:
•

Intellectual Property: Protecting the patents and designs used
in creating hardware.

•  Data Privacy: Ensuring hardware design doesn't compromise

user privacy or lead to security breaches.

•  Regulations: Following environmental and safety standards
during manufacturing, including hazardous material use and
disposal.

Ethical Considerations:
•  Labour Practices: Making sure workers in factories that produce
computer hardware have fair conditions, without exploitation or
unsafe environments.

•  Conflict Minerals: Not using minerals from areas where mining

money supports human rights abuses.

•  Planned Obsolescence: Considering the lifecycle of products to
ensure that devices are not designed to force consumers to buy
new products more frequently.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 17

Social Considerations:
•  Digital Divide: Designing affordable and accessible hardware to

reduce the gap between those with and without access to
technology.

•  E-waste: The growing volume of electronic waste due to the
short lifecycle of devices and the need for better recycling
systems to prevent environmental issues.

Historical Development of Computers
From early mechanical devices to modern computing, computers
have evolved drastically.
•  Early Transistors: Replaced vacuum tubes in the mid-20th

•

century, making computers smaller, faster, and more reliable.
Integrated Circuits (ICs): Allowed multiple transistors to be
placed on a single chip, further reducing size and increasing
computing power.

•  Microprocessors: Introduced in the 1970s, integrating the CPU

onto a single chip, revolutionising personal computing.
•  Modern Multi-core CPUs: Modern processors have multiple

cores, each capable of handling tasks simultaneously, improving
efficiency and performance.

Understand how the advancements in materials and manufacturing
have influenced the design and efficiency of components over time.
•  Silicon and Semiconductor Technology: Silicon is used to

create tiny electrical circuits on chips, enabling the development
of smaller and faster computers with integrated circuits. Making
these components smaller, increases processing power in
addition to lowering costs and energy consumption.
•  Nanotechnology: Nanotechnology involves manipulating

materials at an atomic level to create nano transistors, enabling
smaller, faster, and more efficient processors. This makes the
transistors more packed and denser therefore increasing speed
and energy efficiency.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 18

•  3D Chip Architecture: 3D chip architecture stacks layers of

chips vertically, allowing more components in less space. This
design shortens the distance for electrical signals, enhancing
data transfer speeds and reducing power consumption.
•  Quantum Computing Materials: Quantum computers use

superconductors to leverage quantum effects, solving complex
problems far more efficiently than classical computers.
•  Advanced Cooling Systems: New cooling materials and

systems, such as liquid cooling, prevent overheating of high-
speed components.

•  Photonic Materials: Photonic materials use light instead of
electricity for data transmission, offering faster speeds and
greater bandwidth.

1.1.2
Peripheral

Learners should be aware of developments in storage
technologies and capacity over time.

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 20

Cache Memory
•  Provides quick access to frequently used data and instructions for

the processor.

•  Very fast, smaller than RAM, and located either in or close to the

CPU.

•  Temporarily stores copies of data from main memory to speed up

processing.
Virtual Memory
•  Extends the computer’s RAM by using part of the hard drive as

additional memory.

•  Allows more applications to run simultaneously by swapping data

in and out of RAM.

•  Slower than actual RAM since it relies on hard disk speed.
•  The process of moving data between RAM and the hard drive is

called paging.

•  The operating system breaks down the data into small chunks
and manages which pages are in RAM and which are in virtual
memory.

•  Thrashing occurs when a computer's virtual memory system
overused, causing a significant slowdown in performance.
•  This happens when the system spends more time swapping

pages between the RAM and the hard drive than executing actual
instructions.

Secondary Storage Media
There are various secondary storage technologies that exist and
when trying to understand examples of use, it is important to
understand the characteristics that will affect the decision.

General characteristics of Secondary Storage Media
•  Capacity: The amount of data a storage device can hold. It

varies widely among different types of storage.

•  Durability: How well a storage medium can withstand physical
damage and environmental conditions. Solid state storage is
typically more durable than magnetic storage.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 21

•  Reliability: The likelihood that the storage device will perform

correctly without failure. Magnetic and optical media can be prone
to wear over time.

•  Read/Write Speed: The speed at which data can be read from or
written to the storage device. SSDs generally offer faster speeds
than HDDs and optical storage.

Optical Storage
•  CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray discs.
•  Uses laser technology to read and write data.
•  Generally, has lower capacity compared to other storage types.

Optical Storage Characteristics:
•  Capacity:

•  CDs (Compact Discs):

•  Standard capacity is typically 700 MB.
•  Can hold audio, data, or other digital formats.

•  DVDs (Digital Versatile Discs):

•  Standard single-layer DVDs hold 4.7 GB, while dual-layer

DVDs can hold 8.5 GB.

•  Suitable for video content, software, and data storage.

•  Blu-ray Discs:

•  Single-layer Blu-ray discs can hold 25 GB, and dual-layer

discs can hold 50 GB.

•  Designed for high-definition video and large data storage.

•  Durability:

•  Optical discs are generally more resistant to environmental
factors like humidity and temperature than magnetic media.
However, they can be scratched, which may affect data
retrieval.

•  Reliability:

•  Optical storage is considered reliable for long-term storage,
as data is less susceptible to magnetic fields compared to
magnetic storage.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 22

•  Read/Write Speeds:

•  The read/write speeds vary by format, with newer

technologies like Blu-ray offering faster performance and
greater capacity than traditional CDs and DVDs. However, it
is slower than other methods of secondary storage.

Magnetic Storage
•  Hard drives (HDDs), magnetic tapes.
•  Uses magnetic fields to store data.
•  Offers large capacity and is cost-effective for extensive data

storage.

Magnetic Storage Characteristics:
•  Capacity:

•  HDDs offer capacities ranging from 500 GB to over 20 TB.
•  Magnetic tapes are often used for backup and archival

purposes in data centres. A single tape can hold up to 20 TB
or more.

•  Durability:

•  HDDs contain moving parts (platters and read/write heads),
making them vulnerable to physical damage from drops,
shocks, or vibrations.

•  Over time, mechanical components can wear out, especially

with constant use.

•  Magnetic tapes are more durable for long-term storage and

can last for many years if stored correctly.

•  Tapes can be damaged by dust or strong magnetic fields but
are generally more durable than HDDs in static environments.

•  Reliability

•  Generally reliable for storing large amounts of data, but they
have a higher risk of failure compared to solid-state storage
due to moving parts.

•  Tapes are considered highly reliable for long-term archive

storage.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 23

•  Read/Write Speeds:

•  HDD speeds are dependent on the rotation speeds measured

in RPM.

•  Magnetic tape is slower and because data is stored
sequentially, accessing specific data can be slow.

•  HDD and Magnetic tape have faster read/write speeds than

optical storage.

Solid State Storage
•  Solid State Drives (SSDs).
•  Uses flash memory technology for data storage.
•  Faster than magnetic drives and more durable, as they have no

moving parts.

Solid State Storage Characteristics:
•  Capacity:

•  SSDs can range from 128 GB to 4 TB for personal devices,
with larger capacities available of 100 TB or more, but these
come at a very high price.

•  Durability:

•  SSDs have no moving parts, making them much more

durable than HDDs.

•  They are more resilient to drops, shocks and vibrations.
•  SSDs do have a limited number of read/write cycles, but
modern SSDs are designed to last for many years.

•  Reliability:

•  SDs are highly reliable for storing data, as they don't suffer

from mechanical failure like HDDs.

•  SSDs are generally more reliable than HDDs, but data
recovery from a failed SSD is often more difficult.

•  Read/Write Speeds:

•  SSDs have extremely low latency compared to HDDs,
meaning they can access and transfer data almost
instantly.

Cloud Storage
•  Services like Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud.
•  Stores data on remote servers accessed via the internet.
•  Provides flexibility and accessibility from anywhere with an

internet connection, with various subscription plans for different
storage needs.

Cloud Storage Characteristics:
•  Capacity:

•  This could be considered unlimited, there is scalable options
of data capacity, but often at a price, usually through a
subscription.

•  Durability:

•  Highly durable due to the responsibility of the cloud company
to ensure the access of data. This is done through data
backup systems.

•  Reliability:

•  Cloud data is distributed across multiple servers, therefore

even if one server fails, users can still access their data from
another. This makes cloud storage more reliable than local
drives that could fail without warning.

•  Read/Write Speeds:

•  This is internet dependent, the read (download) and write
(upload) speeds are based on the connection of the
individual.

As data is transmitted to remote servers, latency is possible and
higher than SSD or HDD but is generally not noticeable by the users.

A = 10, B = 11, C=12, D=13, E=14 and F=15).

There are various methods to convert between binary, hexadecimal and
denary, below are common methods:

Conversion Steps:
•  Denary to Binary: Divide the denary value by 2 and include the remainder,
which will always be either a 0 or 1. Repeat this process until 0 is reached
Then reverse the order of the remainders.

Digital Storage of Graphics
Vector graphics are stored using mathematics
•  A vector uses mathematical representations of geometrically primitive

objects (lines, curves etc.) to represent images.

•  Vector graphics can be scaled up without loss of apparent quality.
•  They are smaller than bitmap graphics in terms of the memory required to

store them.

•  Vectors can be edited easily and are used for graphical designs such as,

logos and icons.

Raster graphics are stored in pixels:
•  Each pixel has a colour value that is stored as a binary value.
•  Each image will have a bit depth, which impacts on the size and quality of

the image.

•  The greater the bit depth the more colour information, detail and greater

quality, but also a larger file size.

Resolution
•  This refers to the number of pixels in an image, represented by width and

height.

•  The higher the resolution the greater the quality and detail of the images.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 29

•  The higher the resolution the higher the file size.

Bit Depth
•  The number of bits used to represent the colour of each pixel in an image.
•
It specifies how many bits are used to store information about a pixel’s
colour.

•  An 8-bit bit depth means that 8 bits will be allocated per pixel. Allowing for

256 different combinations.

•  The higher the bit depth, the larger the file size and increased quality.

Colour Depth:
•  The number of colours that an image can represent – affected by the bit

depth.

•  Higher values allow for more colours to be represented.
•  When referred to, this will be as "bits per channel" (bpc).
•  Example: 8-bit colour depth for “RGB” would be:
•  8-bits for R, 8-bits for G and 8-bits for B.

Note: Historical lower-depth systems mainly used bits per pixel (bpp).
This specification uses modern conventions of bits per component (also known
as bits per channel) (bpc)

Colour Model:
•  A mathematical model describing the way that colours can be represented

as tuples of numbers.

•  These are typically three or four values or colour components (e.g., RGB,

CMYK)

Calculating Image Storage Requirements
To calculate the storage requirement for an image, you need to know:

1.  Resolution: The width and height of the image in pixels.
2.  Colour Depth: The number of bits used per channel.
3.  Bit Depth: The number of bits used per pixel.

Step-by-Step Calculation

Formula for calculation:

Determine the Total Number of Pixels:

Storage Size  =   (Width  ×  Height  ×  Bits Per Pixel)

•  Multiply the width by the height of the image.
•  Example: For an image with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels:

𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃 = 1920 × 1080 = 2,073,600 𝑝𝑝𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃

Calculate Bits Per Pixel (bpp):
•  Multiply the bit depth by the number of channels.
•  Example: For an 8-bit RGB image:

𝐵𝐵𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇 = 8 (𝑏𝑏𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃  −  𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑅𝑅) + 8 (𝑏𝑏𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃  −  𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐺𝐺) + 8 (𝑏𝑏𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃  −  𝐵𝐵𝑇𝑇𝐵𝐵𝑃𝑃)

= 24 𝑏𝑏𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃

Calculate Total bits:
•  Multiply the total number of pixels by the bits per pixel.
•  Example:

𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑏𝑏𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃 = 2,073,600 𝑝𝑝𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃 × 24 𝑏𝑏𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃 = 49,766,400 𝑏𝑏𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃

•  Divide the total bits by 8 (1 byte = 8 bits).
•  Example:

𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 =

= 6,220,800 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃

Convert bytes to kilobytes (KB):
•  Divide the total bytes by 1024 (since 1 KB = 1024 bytes).

•  Sample: A single measurement of sound taken at a specific point in time
•  Channels: The number of audio channels, mono being 1 channel and

stereo being 2 channels.

•  Sample Rate: The number of samples of audio carried per second,

measured in Hz or kHz. - also known as Sample Frequency

•  Bit Depth: For audio, this is the number of bits used to record each sample.

Higher bit depths allow for more precise representation of a sound's
amplitude

•  Bit Rate: The amount of data processed per second of sound. It is

calculated by multiplying the sample rate by the bit depth

•  Sample Quality: The term used to describe the effect of the sample

rate/frequency.

Calculating Sound Storage Requirements
Formula:

Storage Size =   �Sample Rate  ×  Bit Depth  ×  Channels  ×  Duration (seconds)�

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 32

Calculate Total bits:
•  Multiply the given Sample Rate, Bit Depth, Number of Channels and

Duration

•  Example: A stereo (2 channels) audio file with a sample rate of 44.1 kHz

(44,100 samples per second), a bit depth of 16 bits, a duration of 3 minutes
(180 seconds):

Total bits =  44100  ×  16  ×  2  ×  180  =  254,016,000 bits

Convert bits to bytes
•  Divide the total bits by 8 (1 byte = 8 bits).

Compression
Compression is the process of decreasing file sizes but still preserving the data
so that it is usable. There are two types of compression techniques:
•  Lossy:

•  This method will generally reduce the size by a greater amount but will

also reduce the quality.

•  The data removed is often considered less important or detectable by

the user.

•  Examples: MP3, JPEG, MPEG

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 34

•  Lossless:

•  This method will maintain the quality but is less likely to reduce the file
size by as much as lossy. It enables the file to be uncompressed to
original form.

•  Reduces file sizes by finding non-essential information and

redundancies in the data and encoding them more efficiently using
things such as an index file.

•  Examples: WAV, PNG, BMP, FLAC

Compression Calculations
Calculate the size of files based on the compression ratio:

•  Example: Original data size = 1000, Compressed data size = 200

𝑐𝑐𝑇𝑇𝑐𝑐𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝐺𝐺 𝑟𝑟𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇  =

Understand the following data structures:
•  Records: this data structure consists of several fields. A field consists of a

single data item, and this can be any data type.
•  A record would be used when trying to store data about an object or
person that might require more than one data type. For example,
student information, vehicle information and product information.

•  One-dimensional arrays: an array of similar data types. The data items

within the array are called elements.
•  1D arrays are stored in linear fashion and are identified by a unique

index (starting at 0).

•  Example: Name[David, Joe, Sarah]

•  Name[0] = David
•  Name[1] = Joe
•  Name[2] = Sarah

•  Two-dimensional array: an array of similar data types stored in columns

and rows. The data items within the array are called elements.
•  The data is stored in rows and columns and when identifying location,
rows go first (starting at index 0) and columns go next (starting at 0).

•  Example: Student exam marks

Automated systems are made up of different parts that work together.

Sensors
•  Sensors are devices that find and measure physical properties like

temperature, light, and movement. They take this information and turn it into
signals that a system can understand. For example, a sensor that measures
temperature in a smart thermostat or a sensor that detects movement in a
security system.

Actuators
•  Mechanical or electrical devices that will perform physical actions based on
the requirement of the signals from the system. For example, motors that
control robot arms or open windows in automated greenhouses.

Controllers/processors
•  The central part of the system, which processes input data from sensors,
runs algorithms, and sends instructions to actuators. It makes decisions
based on the programmed logic. For example, a microprocessor in a robot
or CPU in a computer system that controls automated greenhouses.

Communication networks
•  The infrastructure that allows different parts of the automated system

(sensors, actuators, controllers) to communicate with each other, often in
real-time. For example, wired or wireless networks, such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi,
or Bluetooth, which enable communication between components.

Human-Machine Interface (HMI)
•  The user interface which humans interact with automated systems. It
displays system status and allows input or control from the user.  For
example, a touchscreen control panel for controlling machines in
manufacturing or mobile phones to control smart home devices at home.

Learners should understand:
•

the structure of automated systems, including:
•  sensors
•  actuators
•  controllers/processors
•  communication networks
•  human-machine interface
the function of automated systems, including:
•  data acquisition
•  processing and decision-making
•  control
•  communication
•

feedback and adaptation.

•

Learners should be aware of:

•

the ethical, social and legal implications of
automated systems, such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI).

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 37

The function of automated systems
•  Data Acquisition: The storing of data collected from sensors or other

devices and inputted into the system for processing. For example, storing
temperature form a nuclear power chamber.

•  Processing and decision-making: The system analyses the data it gets,
interprets it and makes decisions based on programming rules, algorithms
or machine learning. For example, a greenhouse turning on sprinklers when
the humidity is too low or temperature too high.

•  Control: Control signals are sent to actuators to perform necessary tasks
based on decisions made during the processing stage. For example,
starting a motor to control a window in an automated greenhouse.

•  Communication: This means sending data between different parts of the
system or different systems, ensuring everything works together. For
example, a self-driving car’s sensor talking to its main computer to avoid
obstacles or a smart fridge sending data to a mobile app.

•  Feedback and adaption: The system keeps track of how it is doing and

adjusts to improve and optimise its performance. A Greenhouse example:
Feedback:
•  User Input: The user of a greenhouse sets the desired conditions for
growing tomatoes, such as temperature at 25°C, humidity at 60%, and
light exposure for 12 hours a day.

•  System Response: The greenhouse control system adjusts the

heating, cooling, humidifiers, and lighting to meet these conditions.
•  Sensor Data: The system continuously monitors the temperature,

humidity, and light levels using various sensors placed throughout the
greenhouse.

Adaptation:
•  Feedback Analysis: The system notices that during the afternoon, the
temperature tends to rise above 25°C due to intense sunlight, and
humidity drops below 60%.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 38

•  System Adjustment: The system adapts by activating additional

cooling measures, such as opening vents or increasing the operation of
fans and turning on misting systems to maintain the desired humidity
levels.

•  Learning Over Time: Over time, the system learns the daily and

seasonal patterns of temperature and humidity changes. It starts to pre-
emptively adjust the conditions before they deviate from the set
parameters, ensuring a more stable environment for the tomatoes.

Ethical Implications
•  Job Displacement: Some jobs may disappear because machines can do

them instead of people or staff will have to retrain to adapt to new
technology.

•  Privacy Concerns: Automated systems collect a lot of personal data, which

can lead to privacy issues if not stored correctly and securely.

•  Bias: AI can show unfair results based on wrong data in its training, like

biased facial recognition.

Social Implications
•  Economic Inequality: Automation can widen the gap between rich and poor,
as skilled workers may gain more benefits than those in vulnerable jobs.
•  Accessibility: Automated systems can help people access services better,
like AI diagnostics in healthcare for people with disabilities that stop them
from attending medical appointments.
Impact on Human Interaction: Overusing automated systems may reduce
face-to-face contact in areas such as customer service and reduce that
personal element that comes from human interaction.

•

•  Digital divide: Systems that use automated systems, such as call centres

that require navigation and processing through automated systems, may be
more difficult for elderly customers.

Legal Implications
•  Liability and Accountability: Who is responsible if an automated system

causes harm? This is crucial for systems like self-driving cars.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 39

•  Regulation and Compliance: Laws are needed to ensure AI and automation

•

are safe and ethical.
Intellectual Property Rights: Questions arise about who owns what AI
creates, especially in fields like art and literature.

•  Scalability: This is the ability to add additional devices to the network

without losing its integrity or performance.

•  Reliability: How strong the network it is, without the network failing.
•  Latency: The delay before data transfers after a request has been

made.

•  Bandwidth: This refers to the data transfer rate of the network

meaning how much data can be transferred. Bandwidth is measure in
bps (bits per second)

Types of Networks:
Learners should understand the characteristics of each of the following
types of networks:
•  PAN (Personal Area Network): A small network used to connect
devices usually within a household. It has a limited range. It is
relatively easy to set up and can connect through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth
and wired network technology.

•  LAN (Local Area Network): A network that connects devices within a
small geographical area, usually a single building. Typically, a small
home or office network that shares peripheral such as printers. It is
relatively easy to set up and does not require great costs.

•  MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): Smaller than a WAN but larger
than a LAN. Usually covers a range such as a city or a campus. Can
be expensive to set up but does allow for connections over wider
ranges as opposed to a LAN.

•  WAN (Wide Area Network): A network that connects over a large

geographical area. It connects multiple LANs over a large range. The
internet is an example of a WAN.

Learners should be aware of:
•

the evolution of communication networks, from
traditional telecommunication systems to
modern high-speed broadband and networks.

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 41

•  VPN (Virtual Private Network): A secure network that allows user to

access private networks remotely over the internet. They use
encrypted tunnels to protect data. As it uses the internet, the range is
extensive but can be slower due to the encryption process.

Advantages of networks:
•  Resource Sharing: People can share things like printers and files

easily over a network.

•  Communication: Networks make it easy to communicate through

emails, video calls, or text messages.

•  Central Data Management: Information can be stored in one place,

so it is easier to access and avoids duplication.

•  Scalability: Networks can grow to meet increased demands by

adding more devices.

•  Collaboration: Many people can work on a project together at the

same time.

Disadvantages of networks:
•  Security Issues: Networks can be at risk from hacking or unwanted

access.

•  Setup and Maintenance Costs: Building a network, especially a big

one, can be very expensive.

•  Complexity: Keeping a large network running well needs advanced

skills, and fixing problems can be difficult.

•  Performance Problems: When many people use the network at

once, it may slow down.

•  Dependency: If the network stops working, everything linked to it can

also stop.

Network Topologies
Bus Topology:
All devices are connected to a single central cable, which has terminators
at each end to ensure proper operation.

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 42

Advantages:
•  Easy and inexpensive to install for small networks.
•  Uses less cable compared to other topologies.
Disadvantages:
•
•  Difficult to troubleshoot.
•  Performance degrades as more devices are added due to data

If the main cable fails, the whole network goes down.

collisions.

Ring Topology:
Devices are connected in a loop, with each device connected to the next,
forming a ring.
Advantages:
•  Data travels in one direction, reducing the chances of collisions.
•  Better performance than bus topology when handling many devices.
Disadvantages:
•  A failure in any cable or device breaks the entire network.
•  Adding or removing devices can disrupt the network.

Star Topology:
All devices are connected to a central hub or switch, creating a star-
shaped network.
Advantages:
•  Easy to install and manage.
•  Failure of one device doesn’t affect the others.
•  Easy to add new devices without disrupting the network.
Disadvantages:
•
If the central hub or switch fails, the whole network goes down.
•  Requires more cable than bus topology, increasing installation costs.

Mesh Topology:
Every device is connected to every other device, providing multiple
pathways for data.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 43

It is highly reliable, as there are many paths for data to travel.
If one path fails, data can take another route.

Advantages:
•
•
•  Can expand and modify the topology without disrupting other nodes.
Disadvantages:
•

It is expensive and more complicated to install due to the high number
of connections required.

•  Usually needs specific staff employed for maintenance and

management.

Hardware Needed for Connectivity:
•  Routers:

•  Connects different networks and sends data between them.
•  Stores the addresses of computers on a network using a routing

table and transfers data between networks and devices.

•  Helps devices access the internet, directs traffic and manages IP

addresses.

•  Hubs:

•  A basic device that links devices in a LAN and sends data to all of

them.

•  Hubs are inexpensive but not efficient since it slows down the
network, due to data be sent to all devices across a network.

•  Switches:

•  More advanced than hubs.
•  Analyses each packet of data and sends it to the computer it was

•

intended for.
Improves network performance in LANs by managing traffic better
and improving network performance.

•  Bridges:

•  Connects parts of different networks so they work together as a

single network.

•  Helps reduce data collisions and can filter data.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 44

•  Gateways:

•  Connects different networks that may use different protocols.

Gateways can translate data from one network type to another,
such as connecting a WAN to a LAN.

•  Helps different networks communicate even if they have different

protocols, like a home network to the internet.

•  Wireless Access Points (WAPs):

•  Allows wireless devices connect to wired networks using Wi-Fi.
•  Help extend the reach of networks by enabling wireless

connectivity.

•  Common in homes and offices for mobile access to the internet.

Network Protocols
Network protocols are established sets of rules that help determine how
the data is transmitted across a network. They are essential for
consistent communication with all devices on a network regardless of
their differences.
There are several protocols that support network communication,
including:
•  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): Is the first protocol of the
Internet Protocol suite. It ensures a reliable transmission of data
across a network. There are four main characteristics of the TCP;
reliable transmission, error checking, order delivery and congestion
management.
Internet Protocol (IP): Is responsible for getting packets from one
location to another through routing. It uses IP addresses to locate the
destination.

•

•  Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): A protocol which allows

webpages to be shared across different computers and browsers. It
explains how messages are set up and sent between web browsers
and servers.

•  Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS): HTTPS is a more

secure version of HTTP. It helps keep information safe when you use
the internet. It uses encryption methods such as SSL/TLS. This

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 45

coding makes your information unreadable to anyone trying to steal it.
Finally, authentication is used to verify the website’s identity.
•  File Transfer Protocol (FTP): Is normally used for transfer files

between client and server.

•  Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): SMTP is the standard

protocol for sending emails across the internet.

•  Post Office Protocol (POP3): POP is used to receive emails from a
remote server. They are downloaded to a local email client and are
viewed offline.
Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP): IMAP enables emails to
be downloaded from the server to multiple client devices. However,
unlike POP, the email can be set to remain on the server after being
downloaded.

•

•  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP): BGP stands for Border Gateway
Protocol. It is a system used to share information about the best
routes for data to travel on the Internet.

•  Domain Name System (DNS): DNS changes website domain names

into IP addresses that computers use to find each other. This is
important for using the internet because it makes it easier to find
websites.

Packet switching and the typical contents of a TCP/IP packet
A packet is a unit of data that is transmitted over a network. When data is
sent, it is segmented into smaller packets. These packets travel through
the network independently to the destination computer, where they are
reassembled in the correct order.

Segmenting the data into packets enhances efficiency and reliability. In
the event of a network issues, routers dynamically find alternative routes
for the packets to travel. If a packet is lost, the receiving computer will
request for a re-transmission of the lost packet.

Cost calculation of routing data on a network
•  Routing Cost: A way to measure and determine the best path to a

destination on a network.

Network hardware devices store measurements of network routing costs,
there are various routing costs that can be stored, the most common are:
•  Bandwidth Cost: The data transfer capacity of a link. Routing

protocol may prefer higher bandwidths.

•  Delay Cost: The time it takes for a packet to travel from the source to

the destination. Lower delay is generally preferred

•  Hop Count: The number of networks or nodes a packet must pass

through to reach the destination.

•  Load Cost: The amount of traffic over a network link. Routing

decisions may consider the load to avoid congestion.

•  Reliability Cost: The error rate of a link; more stable links are

preferred in routing decisions.

The evolution of communication networks:
•  Traditional Telecommunication Systems:

•  Telegraph and Telephone: These systems marked the beginning

of communication networks, enabling point-to-point
communication through electrical signals transmitted over wires.

•  PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network): Used for landline
phones, PSTN is based on circuit-switching, where a dedicated
connection is made for each call. Voice communication is carried
via analogue signals.

•  Dial-up Internet: Early internet access used telephone lines with
limited speeds (up to 56 kbps). Since dial-up shared the phone

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 48

line, telephone calls could not be made at same time.

•  Broadband Technology:

•  ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line): An improvement over
dial-up, ADSL provides faster internet speeds and continuous
access without interrupting the phone line. It uses the same
telephone line but separates voice and data into different
frequency channels.

•  Cable Broadband: This technology delivers internet coaxial cables
originally intended for TV, offering greater bandwidth and higher
speeds than ADSL.

•  Fibre Optics and High-Speed Networks:

•  Fibre Optic Networks: Fibre-optic cables transmit data as light,
providing much faster speeds and greater bandwidth than
traditional copper-based systems. They form the foundation of
modern broadband, enabling high-speed services like FTTH
(Fibre to the Home).

•  4G/5G Mobile Networks: Wireless networks have advanced, with
4G and now 5G enabling high-speed internet on mobile devices.
5G offers ultra-low latency, higher speeds, and supports a vast
number of connected devices (IoT).

•  Wi-Fi:

•  Wi-Fi Evolution: Wireless local area networks (WLANs) have

evolved from early Wi-Fi 802.11 standards with limited range and
speed to the modern Wi-Fi 6, which provides faster speeds,
reduces network congestion, and enhances connectivity in
crowded areas.
•  Emerging Trends:

•  Low Earth Orbit Satellites: Initiatives like Starlink and OneWeb

aim to deliver high-speed broadband via satellites: by orbiting the
earth at lower heights makes for higher speeds and lower latency.

•  6G and Beyond: Research into 6G networks is progressing,

promising even faster speeds, lower latency, and the potential to
support cutting-edge technologies.

Learners should know the characteristics and
definitions of threats to computer systems,
including:
•  malware such as viruses, trojan horses,
ransomware, worms and spyware
•  social engineering such as phishing,
pretexting, baiting, quid pro quo and
impersonation

•  brute force attacks such as simple brute force,
dictionary attacks, hybrid brute force, reverse
brute force and credential stuffing

•  denial of service attacks such as distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS), volume-based
attacks, protocol attacks and application-layer
attacks

•  data interception and theft such as man-in-the-

middle (MiTM) attacks, packet sniffing,
keylogging, session hijacking and IP spoofing

•  SQL injection such as error-based, union-

based, blind Boolean-based and blind time-
based.

Learners should be aware of the legal and ethical
aspects of network security, including privacy
concerns related to data transmission over
networks.

Learners should know the purpose of different
methods of protecting against threats during
system design, creation, testing and use,
including:
•  penetration testing
•  network forensics
•  anti-malware software

Online networks are vital for business communication and data
management but are vulnerable to attacks aimed at accessing sensitive
data.

Ensuring data is secure and free from loss or corruption is essential for
business reputation and legal implications. Cybersecurity are the
methods and measures a business will use to safeguard computer
systems, networks and data from unauthorised access or cyberattacks.

Cyberattacks typically involve different forms of malware, also known as
malicious software. There are various types:
Malware:
•  Viruses: A computer program that can copy itself onto other

programs often with the intention of maliciously damaging data.
Transmitted by 'piggybacking' on another program known as a
'vector'.

•  Trojan horse: this malware that pretends to be harmless but contains
harmful code. It tricks users into activating it, allowing unauthorised
activities. Once installed it can create range of issues, from stealing
data, providing a backdoor to cyber criminals who wish to gain remote
access or the monitoring of activity on a system. This type of malware
can sit undetected without appropriate protection and monitoring.

•  Ransomware: software that will restrict the access of data or

systems to the user unless a ransom is paid. This is often done
through encryption, blocking, or locking the data.

•  Worms: malware, like a virus, but is a standalone program that
replicates itself to spread to other computers. It does not need a
vector. This will find vulnerabilities in the system and then replicate
itself to attack these vulnerabilities. They will then corrupt, delete or
install back door access.

•  Spyware: Malware that secretly monitors a user's activities, collecting
information without user consent or knowledge. Usually installed by
opening attachments or downloading infected software. It can track
browsing habits, messages and keystrokes using Keyloggers.

•  Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
•  secure by design

Keyloggers can be used to track keystrokes and therefore capture
passwords and account numbers for fraudulent use.

Social engineering is the method of capturing data and information by
manipulating information out of people due to naivety or human error.
There are various methods of social engineering, including:
•  Phishing: the method of gathering information from a recipient of a
text, email or phone call by pretending to be a legitimate company.
Phishing documents will often have telltale signs that ask the recipient
to give private information as a matter of urgency.

•  Pretexting: the act of setting up the context of a fictious story to

make the user more likely to believe a phishing attack scenario. This
may not always be done via the computer but can be done in person
by pretending to be someone from a legitimate company.

•  Baiting: the act of luring a recipient into giving out information or

installing malware by clicking on or installing software by giving an
incentive. This could be something as simple as entry to a
competition or something free if they click on the link.

•  Quid pro quo: the act of convincing the recipient to give information
not for financial gain or because they will receive something, but
because the recipient is made to feel that they are being helpful. This
method of social engineering is done by effective social skills of
manipulation to make the recipient feel like they are doing the right
thing.
Impersonation: when the attacker pretends to be a friend, colleague
or employee of a business to get the recipient to give out private
information to gain access to accounts or data.

•

In addition to accessing data and information through malware and social
engineering, cybersecurity issues can occur through brute force attacks.
This is a form of hacking that uses trial and error to correctly find out login
details, passwords and encryption keys. There are various ways these
attacks can take place, such as:
•  dictionary attacks: a method of trying to work out passwords or
encryption keys by using common dictionary wors or word lists

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 51

•  hybrid brute force: a combination of a traditional brute force attack

•

and a dictionary attack
reverse brute force: this type of attack is when commonly used
passwords are used against username and login details to gain
access to accounts

•  credential stuffing: uses stolen username and password details to

try and access other accounts using the same credentials.

Denial of service attacks is a method of attack that attempts to render
the system unusable or unavailable for a period of time. This is often
done by overloading the system with requests that it is unable to handle
and thus the system will effectively crash on the server side.
•  Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS): This method will send

requests frequently and simultaneously from different systems to the
same location to effectively overwhelm the system.

•  Volume-based attacks: This type of attack focusses on volume of
data being sent in order to overwhelm the system or server. The
concept is to exhaust the bandwidth to it and thus rendering it usable.

•  Protocol attacks: This method looks for vulnerabilities in the
communication protocols of the protocol stack. The aim is to
overwhelm specific resources such as firewalls to make the server
and system redundant.

•  Application-layer attacks: These attacks focus on the application

layer of communication and thus stop the webserver communicating
with the users. Ther are various types of application-layer attacks
such as: low and slow, HTTP(s) flooding and BGP hijacking.

Data Interception and theft is the process of the capturing of sensitive
data at the point it is transmitted over a network. There are various ways
of these cyber-attacks taking place including the following:
•  Man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks: This method of attacks finds

weaknesses in the communication channel between server and user
and will intercept the data being sent.

•  Packet sniffing: This method of attack will intercept packets being

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 52

sent along a communication network, regardless of their destination.
These packets are then analysed, and the information is used to
gather data. Packet sniffing is only able to analyse packets that are
either unencrypted or with weak encryption. There are two types of
packet sniffing, active and passive.

•  Keylogging: The process of monitoring keystrokes on a keyboard
without the user’s awareness so that sensitive data can be tracked,
such as usernames, account information and passwords.

•  Session hijacking: This method of attack uses sessions between the
user and the server. It sniffs out sessions and then gains access to
the session ID or cookies that allows the attacker to act as the user.
Once the session ID has been accessed the attacker can continue to
access the system with the appropriate level off access as if they
were the user as long as the session ID stays active.
IP spoofing: IP address spoofing involves an attacker changing the
IP address of a legitimate host so that a visitor who types in the URL
of a legitimate site is taken to a fraudulent or spoofed web page. The
attacker can then use the hoax page to steal sensitive data, such as a
credit card number, or install malware.

•

SQL Injection a technique where malicious users can inject SQL
commands into an SQL statement, via web page input. Injected SQL
commands can alter SQL statements and compromise the security of
information held in a database.
•  Error-based: This technique relies on producing an error in the

database to extract information. The attacker will manipulate an SQL
query to generate an error message that reveals sensitive
information, such as database structure, table names, and column
names. This approach is effective when the web application displays
detailed error messages that can be used to gather information about
the database.

•  Union-based: These attacks use the “UNION” SQL operator to

combine the results of two or more database tables, which allows
them to retrieve data from other database tables. These can only

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 53

work effectively if they are designed in the same way as the original
query in the code. The query sent by the attacker must have the
correct name, number and correct data types for each column. The
best way for attackers to get this correct information is when the
system has error reporting enabled to allow the attacker to work out
the structure based on errors.

•  Blind Boolean-based: similar to union-based SQL injection this

attack tries to extract information about the server’s database. In this
instance though, the extraction is based on extracting information
using the responses from Boolean queries and will gather information
based on the True or False responses.

•  Blind time-based: In time-based attacks, attackers use a trick where
they make the website delay or slow down its response to help them
figure out if their guesses were correct.
Blind time-based SQL injection is important because it can be used to
get secret information from a website, even if the website doesn’t
directly show anything back. By patiently sending commands and
observing the delays, attackers can slowly reveal hidden data.

Learners should understand all the laws and regulations associated with
the protection of privacy of data transmitted across a network, including
the following:
•  UK- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
•  Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018)
•  Computer Misuse Act 1990
•  Telecommunications (Security) Act 2021
•
Investigatory Powers Act 2016 (IPA)
•  Digital Economy Act 2017

Methods of protecting against threats based on the different stages
of development:
•  Design:

•  Secure by design is an approach to software and hardware
development where security is a core focus from the very

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 54

beginning of the design process. Instead of adding security
features after a product is developed, secure by design ensures
that systems are built with security in mind at every stage.
•  Firewalls can be integrated during the design and development

stage. Thinking about firewalls early in the design stage,
developers can design the system with better security measures
in mind. Security features can be built directly into the system
rather than added on later, which is more efficient and effective.
•  User access levels refer to the different permissions or privileges
that are assigned to users within a system based on their roles or
needs. These levels help ensure that users only have access to
the resources and information that are necessary for their role,
reducing the risk of accidental or malicious misuse.

•  Multifactor Authentication (MFA) is a security process that

requires users to provide two or more forms of verification to gain
access to a system or service. This adds an extra layer of
protection beyond just a password.

•  Creation:

•  Anti-malware software in the software development process is to
detect, prevent, and remove malicious software (malware) such
as viruses, ransomware, spyware, and trojans.

•  Firewalls during software development is to control and monitor

network traffic, ensuring that only authorised data and
applications can access the development environment.

•  Encryption is essential in the software development process for
protecting data by converting it into a code that only authorised
users can read or decrypt.
Implement endpoint protections involves securing all devices
(endpoints) that connect to the network during software
development, such as computers, laptops or servers.

•

•  Testing:

•  Penetration testing during software testing simulates real-world
cyberattacks on the software or system to identify vulnerabilities
that could be exploited by malicious actors. The purpose is to

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 55

identify security weaknesses, evaluate the effectiveness of
defences and provide results from the testing that will make
suggestions for improvements.

•  Network forensics will analyse network traffic and logs identify and
investigate suspicious activities, security breaches or anomalies
that may occur within a system. The main purpose and processes
during network forensics include: monitoring and capturing
network data, tracing the source of the attack and ensure
compliance with security protocols, such as encryption and secure
communications.

•  Use:

•  Monitoring systems will continue to track systems performance

and user activity to detect unusual behaviour or security issues in
real time. This will then generate an alert when potential security
breaches occur.

•  Secure supply chains ensure that all software, hardware, and

third-party components used in a system are trustworthy and free
from malicious tampering. This will reduce the risk of
vulnerabilities being introduced into a system from external
components.

•  Conduct security audits involve regularly reviewing and assessing
a system’s security policies, configurations, and procedures to
ensure compliance with best practices and identify vulnerabilities.
These audits help confirm that data protection measures are
working as intended and uncover areas where security can be
improved.

•  Anti-malware software scans, detects, and removes malicious
software that could compromise system security and data
integrity. It provides real-time protection by actively monitoring
files, downloads, and network traffic for any signs of malware.

•  User access levels determine what data and system

functionalities each user can access, based on their role. Only
authorised users can view or modify sensitive data, reducing the
risk of accidental or intentional data breaches.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 56

•  Firewalls act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and

untrusted external networks. They monitor and filter incoming and
outgoing traffic based on security rules, blocking unauthorised
access while allowing legitimate communication.

•  Passwords are a primary method of user authentication, ensuring
that only authorised individuals can access the system. Secure
password practices, such as using strong, unique passwords and
regularly updating them, protect user accounts from unauthorised
access.

•  Backups create copies of important data and store them in secure
locations, ensuring that information can be restored in case of
data loss due to hardware failure, cyberattacks, or accidental
deletion.

•  Multifactor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security by
requiring users to verify their identity through multiple forms of
authentication, such as a password, a security token, or
biometrics.

•  Create an incident response plan outlines the steps an

organisation should take in the event of a security breach or
cyberattack. It helps ensure a swift and coordinated response,
minimising damage and reducing the risk of data loss.

•  Software updates fix security vulnerabilities and bugs that could
be exploited by attackers. Regular updates are essential for
maintaining the security and stability of any system. Keeping
software up to date ensures that known weaknesses are patched,
preventing cyber-attacks from exploiting outdated systems to gain
access to data.

•  Encryption secures data by converting it into a code that only
authorised users can decrypt and read. It protects sensitive
information, both when stored and when transmitted over
networks, ensuring data can only be read with the correct
encryption key. Encryption can be asymmetric or symmetric.

Self-documenting identifiers: using variable names that describe what
the variable contains is important. Poor variable names can make it
difficult to work out what is going on in a program. Sub-program/ function
names should describe what the function does. ‘Function2’ is not a
suitable name for a function used to calculate an average score,
‘calcAverage’ would be more appropriate.

Subroutines is a program unit/module that performs a particular task.
These subroutines are merged to form larger programs and can be called
by the main program or other subroutines. This method of programming
is in modular design. Subroutines can be either functions or procedures.

Inputs and Outputs: when writing algorithms there is often a need to
receive inputs at the beginning to assign value to variables. This can be
done through terminology such as input(“Enter name”) name.
Outputs will often be found throughout the algorithm when calculations
have been completed and need to display to the user. Output will often
appear towards the end of the algorithm. This can be done through
terminology such as print(“Average: ”) average or
output(average(“average”).

Sequence is a set of instructions that are processed one after another.
For example, asking for two pieces of data to be inputted.

Selection is the process of decision making. So, the next instruction will
be executed based on a certain condition. This process is normally
completed using if statements or switch statements such as case select.

Iteration is the process of repeating instructions based on a condition.
This can be either a set number of loops or until a condition is met. The
most common iteration processes are for and while loops. For the loop
to be exited there may be either a count or a rogue value to terminate the
loop.

Counts are variables used to count values to satisfy certain conditions.
An incremental count is one that usually counts upwards by one and can
be shown as count = count + 1.

Rogue Values is the value that is entered into a loop for it to terminate.
This value must be a value which would not normally arise. Example:
grade = -1

String Handling is the dealing with the string data type in programming.
A string can be manipulated to either extract information or to alter it
based on a range of operations.
There are many different types of operations that can be used within a
programming language. Here are some examples and their python
equivalent.

1-D arrays are linear data structures that can be defined as such
myArray[6]. This would mean that the array has 6 elements within it.
The first element will be located in position myArray[0].
2-D arrays are data structures that are made up of rows and tables, that
can be defined as such myArray[6, 5]. This would mean that the
array has 6 elements in rows and 5 in columns. The first element will be
located in position myArray[0, 0].

Characteristics of search algorithms:
•  Linear search will search through a data structure sequentially. Array
data structures will be search in a linear fashion. Linear searches can
be performed by unsorted data structures.

Declare linearSearch(dataList, searchItem)

position = 0
found = false

while position < len(dataList) and found = false
  if dataList[position] = searchItem then
    found = true
  else
    position = position + 1
  end if
end while

•  Binary search will find the midpoint of a data structure and compare
that element against the search item. If the search item is not found it
will discard the half of the data structure that will not contain the
search item and repeat the process of finding the midpoint. It will
repeat all processes until the search item is found. This search can
only be done on sorted data structures.

searchChar is char
first is integer

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 65

last is integer
midpoint is integer
myArray[] is char[]

input searchChar

set first = 0
set last = len(myArray[])- 1

repeat
  set midpoint = (first + last)/2
    if searchChar < myArray[midpoint] then
      set last = midpoint – 1
    else
      set first = midpoint + 1
    end if
until (myArray[midpoint] = searchChar)

output myArray[midpoint]

Characteristics of sorting algorithms:
•  Bubble sort is ideal for sorting data that is nearly sorted data

structures. Bubble sorts will compare two elements next to each
other. If they are not in correct order, they will then swap the two
elements. It will then move onto next element in the data structure.
Once it has reached the end of the file it will return to the start and
repeat the process until all elements are sorted into the correct order.

Declare BubbleSort(bubbleList):
  exchanges = True
  passnum = len(bubbleList)-1
  while passnum > 0 and exchanges = True
   exchanges = False
   for i = 1 to n

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 66

     if bubbleList[i]>bubbleList[i+1]:
        exchanges = True
        temp = bubbleList[i]
        bubbleList[i] = bubbleList[i+1]
        bubbleList[i+1] = temp
     end if next i
   passnum = passnum-1
  end while end Subroutine

bubbleList=[20,30,40,90,50,60,70,80,100,110]

BubbleSort(bubbleList)
print(bubbleList)

•  Selection sort is the process of splitting the array into unsorted and
sorted and moving the smallest element of the unsorted part of the
array into the correct position of the sorted array. This is an efficient
sorting method that uses iteration to repeat the process until all
elements are sorted.

min is integer
n is integer

n = length(Array)

for i = 1 to n
min = i
        for j = i+1 to n
            if (Array[j] < Array[min]) then
              min = j
              swap(Array[i] and Array[min])
            end if
   next j
next i

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 67

•

Insertion sort will use a linear search to find the location in the sorted
portion where the first element of the unsorted portion should be
inserted. It will store this unsorted element into temporary storage. It
will then move all the elements after the insertion location up one
position to make space for the new element. This process is repeated
until all items are sorted.

myArray[0 … 999] is string
i is integer
j is integer
currentItem is integer

for i = 0 to len(myArray) – 1
   currentItem = myArray[i]
     set j = i
     while (j > 0 and myArray[j – 1] >
currentItem)
       myArray[j] = myArray[j – 1]
       set j = j - 1
     endwhile
   myArray[j] = currentItem
next i

Data Validation
Validation is an automatic computer check to ensure that the data
entered is sensible and reasonable. It does not check the accuracy of
data.
•  Type check: checks something of the correct data type is entered.

E.g. a date in a date field or a number in a number field.

x is int
input(“Enter a number”)x
if type(x) is int

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 68

   print("x is an integer")
else
   print("x is not an integer")
end if

•  Range check: checks something is within a specific range. E.g. an
order quantity is between 1 and 10, > 18years old, or <21 etc

age is int
input(“Enter your age”) age
if age >= 18 then
  print(“You are old enough to enter the site”)
else
  print(“You must be 18 to enter the site”)
end if

•  Presence check: checks that something is there. E.g. Mandatory

field. Makes sure REQUIRED fields are entered often marked with *

name as string
Input(Please enter your name”) name
if name = “” then
  print(“This cannot be left blank”)
else
  print(“Welcome” & name)
end if

•  Format check: checks what is entered is of the correct structure. E.g.

Postcode (LLNN NLL) E.g. TS23 3DX.

Def Sub is_valid_postcode(postcode)
postcode_pattern = "^[A-Z]{1,2}[0-9][0-9]?[A-Z]?[
]?[0-9][A-Z]{2}$"

postcode is string

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 69

input(“Enter postcode”)postcode
if postcode matches postcode_pattern then
        print(“Valid postcode”)
else
        print(“Valid postcode”)
end if

•  Length check: Ensures that information is of a specified length.  E.g.
a mobile number field may be more than 11 characters. If it is less or
more, it would not be accepted.

telephone is string

input(“Enter telephone number”)telephone
telephone_Length = telephone.length

if telephone.length < 11 OR >14 then
  print(“This is not the correct number of
characters for telephone number”)
end if

Data Verification
Verification is performed to ensure that the data entered exactly matches
the original source.
•  Double Keying/Entry Verification: Entering the same data twice

and then checking both versions are the same. Asking user to input
re-enter password to ensure the user has inputted it correctly.

password is string
re_password is string

input(“please enter a password”)password
input(“Please confirm password”)re_password

if password <> re_password then

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 70

  print(“Passwords do not match”)
else
  print(“Thank you for submitting password”)
end if

•  Visual Checking Verification: Checking the data entered with the

original document to ensure they are the same. This could be done by
asking user to confirm the information before submitting information.

username is string
confirm is boolean

input(“Please enter your username”)username
input(“Is this the correct username”)confirm

if confirm = True then
  print(“Thank you for confirming”)
else
  print(“Please enter the correct username”)
Eend if

Teacher Guidance

Good programming practices involve ensuring the programmers adhere
to certain principles to make the code accessible to others.
These principles include:
•  Readability means making the code clearer so people can

understand it easily.
•  Principles for improving readability:
•  meaningful naming conventions
•  consistent information and formatting
•  comments and documentation.

•  Extensibility means you can add new features or change what’s

already there without rewriting a lot of code.
•  Better extensibility:

follow the open/closed principle

•
•  use design patterns
•  decouple components
•  parameterise code.

•  Maintainability is how easily the code can be maintained over time,
including fixing bugs or adapting to changing requirements. Code
should be simple to update or improve without introducing new
problems.
•

Improving maintainability:
•  avoid duplicating code
•  Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
•  unit tests
•  version control.

•  Modularity means breaking the code into smaller parts (modules)

that each do a specific job. This makes the code easier to
understand, check, and reuse.
•
Improving modularity:
•  use functions and classes

1.5.2

Learners should know the principles of project
management, including:
•  project initiation and planning
•  project execution and monitoring
•  project control and evaluation.

Learners should understand the stages of
software development, including:
•  planning and analysis: “Investigation”
•  design
•  development and implementation
•
testing
•  deployment
•  maintenance, support and refinement.

Learners should be aware of the legal, ethical and
social consideration surrounding software

•  encapsulation
•  cohesion and low coupling.

Good principles are essential to the success of any project. They provide
a structured approach to planning, executing, monitoring and completion.
•  Project Initiation and Planning: Define the project's objectives,

scope, stakeholders, and resources. Plan thoroughly, breaking down
tasks and estimating costs, schedules, and risks.

•  Project Execution and Monitoring: Manage resources and

coordinate tasks to achieve project goals. Continuously monitor
performance and take corrective actions to stay on track.

•  Project Control and Evaluation: Evaluate performance, adjust as

needed, and formally close the project. Document lessons learned to
improve future project efforts.

The stages of software development:
•  Planning and analysis: “Investigation”: During this stage, the
focus is on the understanding of the scope of the problem, the
requirements and the feasibility. During this stage there is a need for
the gathering of information through investigation. This can be done
by liaising with stakeholders, through interviews, surveys and
observations. Analysts might also look at existing data and the flow of
data. A feasibility study will take place to analyse whether the project
is feasible in terms of technical, financial and operational aspects.
Finally, a scope definition and risk analysis are completed to
determine the objectives of the project and identifying potential risks,
such as resource limitations and technical challenges.

•  Design: During this stage, the system is designed based on the

requirements. This stage is the start of the technical design of the
system. This stage includes developing the Specification Design
Document (SDD) made by the architects. It can contain detailed
designs, data structures, interface design, flow of data and
prototyping.

•  Development and implementation: During this stage, the code is

written by the software developers in line with the requirements of the

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 73

project. During this stage code is written, version control, unit testing
and finally integration of modules into one unified system.

•  Testing: This is crucial for the reliability and quality of the software.
This stage focusses on fixing bugs and testing the validation of the
software, ensuring that it works as intended. There will be a range of
testing strategies including functional, integration, unit and
acceptance testing.

•  Deployment: This is the process of taking it from the development
stage and making it available to the end user. This stage is crucial
and requires careful management to ensure a smooth transition.
•  Maintenance, support and refinement: Once the system is live and
has been fully deployed the maintenance support and refinement
stage starts. This is an ongoing support that involves bug fixes,
updates, performance optimisation, security updates and support.

Learners should be aware of the legal, ethical and social consideration
surrounding software development.

Legal Considerations:
•

Intellectual Property (IP): Developers must ensure they respect IP
laws, including copyright, patents, and trademarks.

•  Data Protection and Privacy Laws: Software handling personal or
sensitive data must comply with regulations like the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA).

•  Licensing Agreements: Software developers must adhere to the

terms of software licenses, whether creating open-source, proprietary,
or commercial software. Misuse of licensed content can result in legal
consequences.

•  Liability and Accountability: Developers must consider legal

accountability for defects, bugs, or security vulnerabilities in their
software that could lead to damage or harm.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 74

Ethical Considerations:
•  Security and User Safety: Developers have an ethical responsibility

to create secure software that protects users from threats like
hacking, data breaches, or misuse of personal data. Ignoring security
concerns can harm users.

•  Transparency and Honesty: Ethical developers are transparent

about how their software works, especially concerning data collection
and usage.

•  Bias and Fairness: Developers must ensure that software, especially
algorithms does not have built-in biases that discriminate against
certain groups based on race, gender, or other factors.

•  User Consent: It’s important to obtain user consent when collecting
personal data, and users should be informed clearly about what data
is being collected, why, and how it will be used.

•  Sustainability: Ethical software development should consider the

environmental impact, including the energy efficiency of the software
and its contribution to e-waste, especially in hardware-dependent
applications.

Social Considerations:
•  Access and Digital Divide: Developers should consider the impact
of their software on different communities, ensuring it is accessible to
users regardless of their socio-economic background, disability, or
location.
Impact on Jobs and Society: Automation and software
advancements can disrupt industries and reduce the need for certain
jobs, raising ethical concerns about their impact on employment and
society. Developers should consider the social impact of their
innovations.

•

•  Content Moderation: For platforms that host user-generated content
(e.g., social media), developers must implement tools and policies for
content moderation to prevent the spread of harmful content.
•  Freedom and Control: Social considerations include ensuring that

users have control over their data and experience, rather than feeling

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 75

manipulated by algorithms.

•  Open Source and Collaboration: The open-source movement

promotes the sharing of software for the benefit of all, contributing to
a collaborative, global development community. Developers working
on open-source projects aim to improve software accessibility,
innovation, and transparency.

High-level languages
High-level programming languages were created to simplify the
programming process for developers. These languages have two key
characteristics: They include a set of predefined keywords, such as
PRINT or IF. They follow specific grammar rules (syntax) that are
language specific. High-level source code must be translated into
machine code before it can be executed by the CPU.

Languages such as Python, Java, and C# are widely used for developing
applications for smartphones, computers, and the web. This means you
can write the code once, and it will function across multiple platforms.
These languages simplify the process by offering shortcuts, pre-built
tools, libraries, and subroutines.

High-level languages are commonly chosen for prototyping or testing new
software ideas because they allow for faster development and require
less focus on intricate technical details.

Low-level languages
There are two main types of low-level language: machine code and
assembly language.

Machine code consists of instructions that are executed directly by the
CPU and are made up of bit patterns. Typically, a machine code
instruction is represented as an 8-bit binary value, such as 10110101.
However, this format is not human-friendly, making it difficult to
understand what the instruction does.

1.5.3
Program construction

Learners should understand:
•

the characteristics and purpose of high-level
and low-level languages

•  situations that require the use of a high-level or

•

a low-level language
the purpose and use of the three common
types of program translator:
•  compilers
•
interpreters
•  assemblers.

Learners should understand:
•

the principal stages involved in the compilation
process:
•
lexical analysis
•  syntax analysis
•  semantic analysis
•  code generation
•  code optimisation

•  examples of programming errors.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 76

Different CPUs use unique binary codes to represent specific
instructions, meaning machine code written for one CPU will not work on
another without being rewritten.

Assembly language consists of a relatively small set of command words
known as mnemonics, designed to be more memorable. This is much
more user-friendly compared to raw machine code. For example, the LDA
command loads data, while the ADD command performs addition.
Low-level languages, like assembly, are commonly used for system
programming tasks that require direct hardware access or fine control
over memory management. These tasks include writing device drivers,
operating systems, and embedded systems software.

Low-level languages are also chosen for performance-critical
applications, such as real-time systems, and are often employed in
embedded systems where memory and performance requirements are
strict.

Compilers
A compiler converts high-level languages into machine executable code
in one go.

Compilers check for errors in the code before turning it into machine
code. If there are mistakes, it will point them out, and an error message
will be outputted. Some compilers can improve the code to make it run
faster or use less memory using optimisation.

Advantages of compilers:
•  programs compiled into machine code usually run faster than those
not compiled, because the computer executes the machine code
directly

•  compilers can catch mistakes in the code before you try to run it,

saving you time and frustration

•  many compilers optimise the code, making the final program more

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 77

efficient

•  protects the intellectual property of the code as this cannot be viewed

once it is compiled.

Disadvantages of compilers:
•  compiling a program can take time, especially for large applications.
This means it can be a bit slow before you even run your program
•  code that is compiled for one type of computer might not work on

another without being recompiled.

Interpreters
An interpreter is a type of tool used in computer programming that
translates code written in a programming language into machine code,
line by line. This means that instead of building a program all at once, the
interpreter reads and executes the code one instruction at a time.

Advantages of interpreters:
•  since interpreters execute code line by line, it's easier to spot and fix

errors right where they occur

•  code is more portable as it is not machine dependent as it has not

been translated to machine code.

Disadvantages of interpreters:
•  an interpreter translates code line by line, running interpreted code

•

•

can be slower than running compiled code
interpreted programs may not run as efficiently as those compiled into
machine code, especially for larger, more complex applications
to run the code on a computer, you must have the right interpreter
installed, which could limit portability.

Assemblers
An assembler is a special program that translates assembly language,
which is a low-level programming language, into machine code that a
computer can understand. An assembler is often tailored to work with
specific hardware. It is usually efficient and uses minimal resources.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 78

Principle stages of compilation process:
•  Lexical analysis:

•  Lexical analysis is the process in which the source program's

stream of characters is read from left to right and organised into
tokens.

•  Tokens are sequences of characters that represent a single unit

of meaning.

•  During lexical analysis, other tasks like removing comments,

ignoring white space between tokens, and handling features like
macros may also be performed for convenience.

•  A symbol table is generated during this stage, which stores the

addresses of variables, labels, and subroutines.

•  Syntax analysis:

•  Syntax involves parsing which is analysing the sequence of

tokens to identify the program's syntactic structure.

•  The tokens are checked against the expected spelling and
grammar based on the language's standard definitions.
If any syntax errors are detected, error messages are generated.

•

•  Semantic analysis:

•  This phase conducts semantic checks, such as verifying data

types and ensuring definite assignment confirming that all local
variables are initialised before use.
It ensures that variables are properly declared and used, and
verifies that they are of the correct data type.

•

•  Checks that operations are valid for the type of variable involved.

•  Code generation:

•  Machine code is generated.

•  Code optimisation:

•  Code optimisation may be employed to make it more

efficient/faster/less resource intense.

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 79

Programming Errors
There are various errors that can occur during the programming
development, these are usually identified during testing or the compilation
process.
•  Logical: An error that causes a program to output an incorrect

answer (that does not necessarily crash the program).
Example: Adding two numbers together instead of taking them away.
•  Runtime: An error that only occurs when the program is running and
is difficult to foresee before a program is compiled and run. Example:
Dividing a value by 0.

•  Syntax: An error that occurs when a command does not follow the
expected syntax of the language, e.g. when a keyword is incorrectly
spelt. Examples: ‘edn if’ instead of ‘end if’

•  Linking: An error that occurs when a programmer calls a function
within a program and the correct library has not been linked to that
program. Example: When the square root function is used and the
library that calculates the square root has not been linked to the
program

•  Rounding: Rounding is when a number is approximated to nearest
whole number/tenth/hundredth. Example: 34.5 rounded to nearest
whole number is 35, an error of +0.5.

•  Truncating: Truncating is when a number is approximated to a whole
number/tenth/hundredth. Example: 34.9 truncated to whole number is
34, an error of –0.9.

1.7.1
Operating systems

Learners should understand:
•
•  how the operating system manages:

the purpose of the operating system (OS)

•  CPU
•  multi-tasking
•
interrupts
•  memory
•  backing store
•  peripherals
•
interface
•  security
the purpose and functionality of a range of
utility software.

•

Learners should be aware of:
•

legal and ethical considerations related to
security features in operating systems
•  user privacy concerns in the context of OS

design.

Operating systems (OS) are essential in making all computer systems
work. It helps manage the hardware and software on devices.

It helps manage the user interface; it provides a way for users to
communicate with the computer. Resource Management makes sure that
all components, like memory and processing power, are used efficiently.
It also helps to protect your computer from unauthorised access.

The operating system also manages the following:
•  CPU: The OS ensures that the CPU has the right tasks to perform at

the right time.

•  Multi-tasking: Multi-tasking is when you can work on several things
at once. The OS helps manage multiple programmes running at the
same time without slowing down your device. The OS handles this by
time-slicing, switching between tasks making tasks seem to like they
are running seamlessly.
Interrupts: External devices, such as keyboard or mouse signal
interrupts to the CPU. OS identifies the interrupt type and calls the
corresponding interrupt handler. CPU switches from the current task
to the interrupt handler. Handler executes required actions. CPU
restores saved task state and resumes previous execution.

•

•  Memory: The OS manages the RAM by allocating space within the

RAM to different applications and processes. It will also handle virtual
memory which extends physical memory.

•  Backing store: The OS manages the backing store by loading,

saving and the organisation of data. It also ensures files, and the file
structure are stored efficiently through methods such as
defragmentation on HDDs.

•  Peripherals: The OS handles the communication between peripheral
devices. It uses device drivers to communicate with hardware by both
sending and receiving data between the computer and the external
device.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 83

•

Interface: The OS provides the connection between the user and the
system. There are different types of OS interfaces such as Graphical
User Interface (GUI), Command Line Interface (CLI) menu driven and
Mobile User Interface (MUI).

•  Security: Many operating systems now provide additional security
measures to ensure data and user security. Measures can include
firewalls, encryption, virus scanning, access levels, passwords and
biometric verification.

Purpose and functionality of utility software:
•  Antivirus software: Protects against and removes malicious
software to safeguard the system from security threats.

•  Backup software: Automatically backs up data to external storage or

cloud services to prevent data loss.

•  Disk cleanup: Optimises disk space usage by removing temporary

data to improve system performance.

•  Disk defragmenter: Reorganises fragmented data to improve file

access speed and overall system performance.

•  File compression/archiving software: Compresses files and folders
into a single archive format to save disk space and facilitate easier file
transfer.

•  System optimisation tools: Tweaks system settings, removes

unnecessary startup programs, and optimises system resources to
enhance performance.

•  Disk partitioning software: Divides a hard drive into multiple
partitions for better organisation of data and improved data
management.

•  Data recovery software: Recovers lost or deleted files, folders, and

partitions from storage devices to restore lost data.

•  Network monitoring software: Monitors network traffic and devices

to identify and troubleshoot network issues and optimise
performance.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 84

Data Protection Laws
•  Laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and DPA

(2018). Developers of the OS must follow these laws by ensuring their
operating systems store and process personal data securely.

Cybercrime and Hacking
•  Security features in operating systems are designed to prevent

cybercrime. Weak security can leave systems vulnerable to attacks
by hackers.

•  Operating systems have firewalls and antivirus tools to stop hackers

from accessing your computer.

User Privacy
•  Operating systems collect data for various reasons. Without proper

security, this data can be exposed.

•  They should be transparent about what data is collected and why.
The operating system should ask for your permission before using
your data and keep that information private.

Security Vulnerabilities
•

If security vulnerabilities are not fixed, it could lead to data theft,
financial loss, or other damages.
It is the responsibility of developers to regularly update and patch
these vulnerabilities to keep users safe.

•

Encryption and Access Controls
•  These are crucial security features in operating systems to protect

sensitive data from being accessed by unauthorised users.
•  Developers must balance security and privacy when designing

encryption systems. They need to ensure data is secure, while also
considering how law enforcement or authorities might need access in
extreme cases.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 85

Security for Vulnerable Users
•  Vulnerable users, such as the elderly, are more likely to fall victim to
cyberattacks, scams, or data breaches, so the operating system
needs extra safeguards.

•  Developers have an ethical responsibility to ensure security features
are easy to use and effective for all types of users, especially those
who may not fully understand complex security settings.

Transparency and Trust
•  Users need to trust that the operating system is keeping their data

•

safe and using it responsibly.
It’s unethical for companies to hide how they collect or use data, or to
create "backdoors" in the operating system that allow secret access
to data.

1.8.1
Systems
development
lifecycle (SDLC)

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

When developing a system, it is important to understand all the factors
that can affect the processes involved in the development of the entire
system. Here is consideration of the key elements of this process:
•  Software:

there is the consideration of the requirements of the software

•
•  user design
•  application requirements
•  database structure
•  compatibility with existing systems
•
•

lifecycle management
integration of the various components such as databases,
applications and communication tools within the system.

•  Hardware:

•

infrastructure including the network, computers, peripheral
requirements and any other networking components

•  optimisation to configure the hardware to work efficiently with
software and processes to ensure optimal performance and
reliability

•  scalability considers if the system can be developed further to

meet greater demand

•  maintenance requirements to ensure that any issues or

development requirements can be easily dealt with, without
disrupting the system.

•  People:

•  Stakeholders need to be considered during the system and

development life cycle. The stakeholders can cover a range of
people involved and invested in the system.

•  Users are the people that will be using the system. These could
be the customers or the staff of the company, but it is important
that their needs and behaviours are considered during this
process.

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 87

•  Administrators are those IT and system administrators who will
manage maintain and secure the system. They will be dealing
with troubleshooting, updates network management and system
optimisation.

•  Training and support will often be provided by the people that will
have experience and understanding of the development of the
system. These people will be there to effectively train the users as
well as provide additional support in the future should issues
arise.

•  Processes:

•  Workflow processes involve creating a structured series of tasks
or actions that guide the interaction and functioning of different
system components. These processes ensure that the system
operates smoothly, reliably, and consistently.

•  Compliance with regulations and governance standards is

essential for processes. Well-designed processes incorporate
checks, audits, and detailed documentation to ensure they align
with legal requirements, industry standards, and internal policies.

•  Automation reduces the need for human intervention, increases
speed, and lowers costs by streamlining tasks. Automation tools
take over routine activities, freeing up resources to focus on other
areas.

•  Optimisation of processes is essential for continuous

improvement, with a focus on refining workflows and eliminating
redundancies. This boosts efficiency, minimises delays, and
streamlines overall operations.

•  Data:

•  Data Management is at the core of modern systems allowing for

decision-making, analytics, and user interaction. When developing
a system, efficient data management ensures the collection,
storage, and retrieval of data in a way that is secure, accessible,
and accurate.

•  Data Quality and Integrity is essential for the reliability of the
system. This involves validating and regularly updating data to

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 88

prevent errors or inconsistencies that could disrupt operations or
lead to poor decision-making.

•  Data Integration provide a complete picture, by gathering data
from variety of sources. For example, external systems and a
variety of databases. Integration enables different system
components to share data and collaborate effectively.
•  Data Analytics and Insights is essential for system

development. By using data analytics, organisations can gain
valuable insights that improve decision-making, optimise
operations, and enhance user experiences.

•  Data Security and Privacy is essential in protecting data from

breaches, unauthorised access, or corruption. System processes
must include robust security measures, such as encryption,
access controls, and compliance with privacy laws like DPA
(2018) and GDPR, to safeguard sensitive data.

Processes followed by developers in the SDLC:
•  Scoping and Feasibility: This phase involves defining the project’s
goals, objectives, and requirements. It assesses the project's viability
in terms of technical, economic, and operational factors to determine
whether it should proceed.

•  Analysis: In this stage, detailed requirements are gathered and

analysed. Stakeholders’ needs are documented, and existing systems
are evaluated to identify gaps and opportunities for improvement,
ensuring that the final system will meet user expectations.
•  Design: The design phase focuses on creating the system

•

architecture, user interfaces, and data models. These guide the
development process, outlining how the system components will work
together to fulfil the requirements of the system.
Implementation: During implementation, the actual development of
the system occurs. This includes coding, configuring hardware and
software, and integrating various components according to the design
specifications.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 89

•  Testing: Testing involves evaluating the system to ensure it meets
the specified requirements and functions correctly. Various testing
methods including unit, integration, system, and user acceptance
testing are planned and applied to identify and fix any issues before
deployment.

•  Deployment: In this phase, the completed system is rolled out to

users. This includes installing the system conducting final checks and
providing necessary training and documentation to users.

•  Maintenance: Maintenance is the ongoing process of monitoring,

updating, and improving the system after deployment. This includes
fixing any issues that arise, implementing enhancements, and
ensuring the system continues to meet user needs.

SDLC Methods:
•  Waterfall: This method is when each of the steps are broken down
and works in a strategic linear fashion. Each step must be fully
completed before moving onto the next step.
•  Strengths:

•
it uses a clear navigation and structure
•
this model is intuitive and collaborative with all team members
•  greater understanding of the requirements from the beginning

of the project

•  documentation is incredibly detailed and therefore staff

members can easily step into the project at different points
•  has a project specific timeframe, due to linear nature, which

can be efficient

•  progress can be easily tracked as each phase has set

milestones providing clear indicators of project status and help
spot issues early.

•  Weaknesses:

•  difficult to make changes once the project has moved from the

beginning steps
this method has limited collaboration with end-user or clients

•
•  only effective for smaller projects

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 90

•  working models and testing do not take place until the latter

stages

•  high risk if initial requirements are misunderstood.

•  Agile: The method breaks projects into different phases that can be
iterative, and teams will frequently reflect on the development and
consider any possible improvements. There is no need to complete
one section before moving on and different phases or sprints can be
worked on simultaneously.
•  Strengths:

•  better adapts to change and requirements
•  can detect and fix issues and errors earlier
•  work closely with the end-user and clients to ensure the

system meets the requirements

•  can have a faster turnaround as not each step needs to be

completed before moving on.

•  Weaknesses

•

limited documentation, making harder for new members to the
team

•  harder to measure progress as progress can happen over

different stages at the same time

•  no full understanding of timescale or costing for system as it is

•

changeable
the design and long-term goals can lack cohesion as the
process is fragmented.

•

Iterative: This method will build on the previous phase. This method
involves continuous improvement as the focus is to trial and improve.
This has less focus on research and investigation. This method allows
for early development and testing.
•  Strengths:

•  will have frequent feedback and adjustments based on

outcomes, testing and requirements

•  will have an early prototype of solution than can be reviewed,

feedback and worked on

•  has continuous improvement and refinement.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 91

•  Weaknesses:

•  can be both resources and time intensive with lack of

timescale

•  can be too iterative and get stuck developing and refining
•  not predictable, so difficult to discuss development stages with

end-users and clients.

•  Spiral: This method of project development uses both systematic and
iterative processes in its phases. The project manager will decide on
the number of phases. The spiral is meant to represent the iterative
processes of the system within each phase.
•  Strengths:

•  software is produced early in the development process
•  provides opportunities for early prototypes or proof-of-

concepts
•
this methodology is strongest for handling risk management
•  can easily change requirements and needs during any phase
•  better for larger more complicated systems.

•  Weaknesses:

•

•

it is an expensive method as it requires more resources and
time, therefore not suitable for smaller projects
increased risk of scope creep due to ongoing changes and
refinements

•  can be difficult to estimate timescale on the project due to the

•

iterative element
requires higher level of expertise due to the need to consider
the risk management elements

•  can have fewer comprehensive documents.

Professional considerations related to industry standards for
software development:
•  Code Quality and Clean Coding:

•  Other developers or teams may need to work on the same code.
If the code is clear and well-structured, it's easier to fix bugs, add
new features, and avoid mistakes.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 92

•  Developers follow guidelines like using meaningful variable
names, proper indentation, and writing comments to explain
complex parts of the code.

•  Version Control:

•  Using a system to track changes made to the code over time, like
using Git or GitHub helps teams work together on the same
project without overwriting each other’s work.
It also makes it easy to revert to earlier versions of the software if
something goes wrong.

•

•  Testing:

•  Writing tests to check if the software works as expected, like unit
tests or integration tests ensures that the code is reliable and
helps find bugs early, preventing problems in the final product.

•  Security Practices:

•  Developers must follow best practices, such as encrypting

sensitive data, using secure passwords, and regularly updating
software to fix vulnerabilities.

•  User-Centred Design:

•  Creating software that is easy to use and meets the needs of its

intended users.

•  Developers work with designers and users to ensure the interface

is intuitive and accessible.

•  Compliance with Legal Standards:

•  Ensuring that the software complies with laws and regulations,

such as data protection laws.

•  Developers must understand relevant legal requirements and
ensure that personal data is handled safely and appropriately.

•  Collaboration and Communication:

•  Large software projects often involve many people, including
developers, designers, testers, and project managers. Good
communication ensures that everyone is on the same page and
that the project runs smoothly.

•  Developers should attend team meetings, use collaboration tools

and document their work clearly.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 93

•  Performance Optimisation:

•  Ensuring that the software runs efficiently, using the least number
of resources as possible, such as memory or processing power.
•  Developers should optimise code to improve speed and reduce

the amount of data processed.

•  Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):

•  A practice where developers integrate code into a shared

repository frequently and automatically deploy the software after
successful testing.
It ensures that the software is always in a working state and
allows for quicker releases of new features or bug fixes.

•

•  Developers use tools to automate testing and deployment and
must ensure their code passes all checks before it’s integrated.

•  Ethical Considerations:

•  Developers are responsible for how their software is used and
must consider the consequences of their work. They should
ensure that the software is used for good purposes and doesn’t
cause harm to individuals or society.

Legal and ethical considerations relating to intellectual property in
software development:
•  Ethical Considerations:

•  Privacy: Respect user privacy, minimise data collection, and

ensure that any data collected is securely stored and protected
from unauthorised access.

•  Security: Develop software with robust security measures,

including encryption and regular security audits, to protect against
data breaches and cyber-attacks.

•  Fairness: Avoid bias and discrimination in algorithms and

implement measures to ensure that all users are treated fairly,
regardless of their background.

•  Accessibility: Make software accessible to users with disabilities
by following accessibility standards and guidelines and providing
alternative input and output options.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

  GCSE Computer Science Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 94

•  Transparency: Be transparent about software functionality,
limitations, and risks, providing clear and comprehensive
information to users about how the software operates and what
data it collects.
Intellectual Property: Respect copyrights and licenses, attribute
sources correctly, and ensure that all third-party content used in
the software is properly licensed.

•

•  Environmental Impact: Minimise energy consumption and

electronic waste by optimising software for energy efficiency and
supporting the recycling and proper disposal of electronic devices.

•  Social Impact: Consider broader societal implications of the

software, promoting positive outcomes such as social inclusion,
education, and well-being, while mitigating any negative impacts.
•  Accountability:  Take responsibility for the ethical implications of
the software, promptly addressing and rectifying any issues that
arise, and ensuring that there are clear processes for users to
report concerns.
