About this handbook: Information for Teachers

This handbook contains the assessment materials for Unit 4: Sustainable Solutions.

Within this handbook, you will find:
•
•

information for teachers on how to manage arrangements for assessment
information for candidates which includes:
•  assessment details (phase 1 and phase 2)
•  a detailed breakdown of each task
•

the mark scheme which must be used to assess candidate work.

You must provide each candidate with a copy of the information for candidates
contained within this handbook.

Managing the assessment

This is a centre-marked (internal) non-examination assessment. The following arrangements
must be followed when managing and marking the assessment.

Time

Candidates must be allowed 6 hours to complete this assessment, split into Phase 1
(research) and Phase 2 (completing tasks 1 to 3). Candidates should spend approximately:
•  3 hours completing research into the issue
•  20 minutes completing task 1
•  1 hour 30 minutes completing task 2
•  1 hour 10 minutes completing task 3.

The time suggested for each task takes account of the contribution of the task to the overall
assessment requirements. There can be no changes to the total time available for this
assessment. Centres can, however, amend the suggested time available for each task.

Resources

Candidates must have access to the Resource Pack (released annually in September on the
Portal), the information for candidates from within this handbook and any necessary
resources, as specified in the detailed task tables within the candidate information.

Collaboration

Group work is not allowed.

Supervision

All tasks in this unit are taken under indirect supervision:

Type

Description

Candidates do not need to be directly supervised at all times.

Indirect

•

The centre must ensure that:
•  all candidates participate in the assessment
•

there is sufficient supervision to ensure that work can be
authenticated
the work an individual candidate submits for assessment is
his/her own.

Candidates' work must always remain within the centre and must
be stored securely between timetabled sessions.

Centres must have arrangements in place to ensure candidates cannot access evidence
they have been developing outside of supervised activities.

Authentication

Supervision must be in place to ensure the authenticity of evidence produced for summative
assessment.

You should not provide input or guidance to candidates during the assessment time. This
includes providing formative feedback on the evidence being produced. You can provide
guidance on the requirements of the task and remind candidates of the mark bands and how
they can be interpreted.

Candidates can review and redraft evidence independently within the time controls for the
assessment.

Candidates must sign the declaration to confirm that all evidence submitted for moderation is
their own work and that any sources used have been acknowledged.

Assessors must sign the declaration to confirm that evidence submitted for moderation was
completed under the controlled conditions set out in this assessment.

Candidate evidence

The acceptable formats for evidence of each of the tasks is summarised in the task tables.
Any modified assessment must enable the candidate to generate the evidence required in
this table.

Marking the assessment

The marking scheme for this assessment is included in the candidate pack.

All marking of evidence must be made against the marking scheme provided. Evidence
marked must comply with any requirements set out in the information for candidates.

Written evidence must be annotated to show how it relates to the mark band requirements.

Marking should only be undertaken by a designated assessor. An assessor should have
appropriate expertise in the subject and level for a specified unit. The assessor is
responsible for ensuring that:
•  assessment is conducted under the controls specified in the task table
•

they are clear about the requirements of the assessment and marking scheme prior to
commencing assessment

•  evidence presented for assessment is valid, authentic; reliable and credible
•  assessment decisions are accurately recorded
•  evidence is appropriately annotated
•

judgements are only made against the mark band statements.

A mark record sheet must be completed for each candidate.

Further information

You should refer the JCQ Instructions for conducting non-examination assessment for
further information on managing assessment within our GCSE Qualifications.

Assessment details

For this assessment learners are required to undertake a decision-making exercise based
on a Candidate Resource Pack that contains a sustainability issue with a number of possible
options. In Phase 1 of the decision-making candidates will need to research the issue
beyond the Candidate Resource Pack. Candidates should then produce a maximum of two
sides of A4 notes to be used during the assessment. These notes will be submitted
alongside the response to the tasks to ensure that they are in line with the instructions for
Phase 1 and do not contain pre-written answers to the tasks in Phase 2.

The assignment, included within the Candidate Resource Pack, will be released on the
Portal during the first week of September for assessment in that academic year.  The
Resource Pack will change annually. Learners should not have access to the Resource
Pack until the start of the assessment.  Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the
year learners undertake the assignment.

This assessment contributes to 15% of the overall qualification grade and will take 6 hours to
complete. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions.
The assignment will be marked out of a total of 60 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be marked by the
centre and moderated by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be
handwritten and scanned or completed digitally).

The submission date for your Unit 4 marks and samples via IAMIS will be 5th May in the year
of award. The moderation samples to be submitted will be generated automatically by IAMIS
following the submission of marks.

The set tasks and mark scheme are contained within this handbook. The Candidate
Resource Pack will be released annually starting in September 2026.
