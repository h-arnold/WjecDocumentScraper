# <span id="page-3-0"></span>About this handbook: Information for Teachers

This handbook contains the assessment materials for Unit 4: Sustainable Solutions.

Within this handbook, you will find:

- information for teachers on how to manage arrangements for assessment
- **information for candidates** which includes:
  - assessment details (phase 1 and phase 2)
  - a detailed breakdown of each task
  - the mark scheme which must be used to assess candidate work.

**You must provide each candidate with a copy of the information for candidates contained within this handbook.**

# <span id="page-3-1"></span>Managing the assessment

This is a centre-marked (internal) non-examination assessment. The following arrangements must be followed when managing and marking the assessment.

## **Time**

Candidates must be allowed **6 hours** to complete this assessment, split into **Phase 1** (research) and **Phase 2** (completing tasks 1 to 3). Candidates should spend approximately:

- 3 hours completing research into the issue
- 20 minutes completing task 1
- 1 hour 30 minutes completing task 2
- 1 hour 10 minutes completing task 3.

The time suggested for each task takes account of the contribution of the task to the overall assessment requirements. There can be no changes to the total time available for this assessment. Centres can, however, amend the suggested time available for each task.

## **Resources**

Candidates must have access to the Resource Pack (released annually in September on the Portal), the information for candidates from within this handbook and any necessary resources, as specified in the detailed task tables within the candidate information.

#### **Collaboration**

Group work is **not** allowed.

{4}------------------------------------------------

## **Supervision**

All tasks in this unit are taken under indirect supervision:

| Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|          | Candidates do not need to be directly supervised at all times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Indirect | The centre must ensure that: <ul><li>all candidates participate in the assessment</li><li>there is sufficient supervision to ensure that work can be authenticated</li><li>the work an individual candidate submits for assessment is his/her own. Candidates' work must always remain within the centre and must be stored securely between timetabled sessions.</li></ul> |

Centres must have arrangements in place to ensure candidates cannot access evidence they have been developing outside of supervised activities.

## **Authentication**

Supervision must be in place to ensure the authenticity of evidence produced for summative assessment.

You should not provide input or guidance to candidates during the assessment time. This includes providing formative feedback on the evidence being produced. You can provide guidance on the requirements of the task and remind candidates of the mark bands and how they can be interpreted.

Candidates can review and redraft evidence independently within the time controls for the assessment.

Candidates must sign the declaration to confirm that all evidence submitted for moderation is their own work and that any sources used have been acknowledged.

Assessors must sign the declaration to confirm that evidence submitted for moderation was completed under the controlled conditions set out in this assessment.

#### **Candidate evidence**

The acceptable formats for evidence of each of the tasks is summarised in the task tables. Any modified assessment must enable the candidate to generate the evidence required in this table.

#### **Marking the assessment**

The marking scheme for this assessment is included in the candidate pack.

All marking of evidence must be made against the marking scheme provided. Evidence marked must comply with any requirements set out in the information for candidates.

{5}------------------------------------------------

Written evidence must be annotated to show how it relates to the mark band requirements.

Marking should only be undertaken by a designated assessor. An assessor should have appropriate expertise in the subject and level for a specified unit. The assessor is responsible for ensuring that:

- assessment is conducted under the controls specified in the task table
- they are clear about the requirements of the assessment and marking scheme prior to commencing assessment
- evidence presented for assessment is valid, authentic; reliable and credible
- assessment decisions are accurately recorded
- evidence is appropriately annotated
- judgements are only made against the mark band statements.

A mark record sheet must be completed for each candidate.

#### **Further information**

You should refer the JCQ Instructions for conducting non-examination assessment for further information on managing assessment within our GCSE Qualifications.

{6}------------------------------------------------

# <span id="page-6-0"></span>Assessment details

For this assessment learners are required to undertake a decision-making exercise based on a Candidate Resource Pack that contains a sustainability issue with a number of possible options. In Phase 1 of the decision-making candidates will need to research the issue beyond the Candidate Resource Pack. Candidates should then produce a maximum of **two** sides of A4 notes to be used during the assessment. These notes will be submitted alongside the response to the tasks to ensure that they are in line with the instructions for Phase 1 and do not contain pre-written answers to the tasks in Phase 2.

The assignment, included within the Candidate Resource Pack, will be released on the Portal during the first week of September for assessment in that academic year. The Resource Pack will change annually. Learners should not have access to the Resource Pack until the start of the assessment. Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the year learners undertake the assignment.

This assessment contributes to 15% of the overall qualification grade and will take 6 hours to complete. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions. The assignment will be marked out of a total of 60 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be marked by the centre and moderated by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be handwritten and scanned or completed digitally).

The submission date for your Unit 4 marks and samples via IAMIS will be **5 th May** in the year of award. The moderation samples to be submitted will be generated automatically by IAMIS following the submission of marks.

The set tasks and mark scheme are contained within this handbook. The Candidate Resource Pack will be released annually starting in September 2026.

# <span id="page-7-1"></span>Assessment

## **Phase 1 – Research the issue (approximately 3 hours)**

This phase requires you to use the Candidate Resource Pack, apply your previous learning and undertake research to explore the issue presented.

You should then produce a maximum of **two** sides of A4 notes to be used during the assessment. These notes will be submitted alongside the response to the tasks and must not contain pre-written answers to the tasks you are about to complete.

### **Phase 2 – Responding to the issue (approximately 3 hours)**

You are required to complete the tasks to:

- summarise and present the geographical issue presented in the resource booklet
- present the potential benefits and negative impacts of each proposed option on people (including any human rights and diversity issues), the economy and the environment
- assess the potential positive and negative impacts that you have presented for each of the proposed options to form a sustainability impact assessment
- recommend the most suitable option based on your sustainability impact assessment
- explain why the other options have been rejected
- demonstrate how your chosen option links to specific goals from the:
  - the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
  - the well-being goals in the Well-being of Future Generations Act (Wales) 2015.
