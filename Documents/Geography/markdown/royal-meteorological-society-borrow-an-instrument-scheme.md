## **Royal Meteorological Society Borrow an Instrument Scheme**

We have recently been made aware of this exciting scheme in which the Royal Meteorological Society, through their MetLink website, have been lending out weather instruments, such as thermometers, anemometers, rain gauges, infrared thermometers and Kestrel Weather stations from the Society for use in schools.

This is a free scheme, where all is asked of schools is for them to cover the cost of packaging and posting the materials on return (usually around £13) and to be responsible for any instruments that are borrowed. The Society are keen to link up with schools across the UK, and in particular increase the number of schools accessing the scheme from Wales.

This is a brilliant chance to get hold of and use weather instruments for fieldwork, all the way from Key Stage 3, through GCSE and to A-Level, which would normally be very expensive for schools to purchase and use.
