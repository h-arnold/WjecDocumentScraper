## WJEC GCSE GEOGRAPHY BULLETIN JANUARY2O25

Happy new year to you all! We hope you had a lovely Christmas, got a good break from teaching, and enjoyed the time off with your families and loved ones. This bulletin provides some important information and links to resources to support you with the delivery of the teaching, departmental teams and most importantly your learners.

## EXAMINATIONDATESFORSUMMER2O25

We can confirm the following dates for the Unit 1 and 2 exams in the summer of 2025:

- Unit 1: Tuesday 13th May (am)
- Unit 2: Friday 6th June (pm)

## UNIT 3 NEA ADMINISTRATION

have completed before Christmas, is Friday 17th January. You should have plastic sacks and address labels to return the answer booklets to Treforest, please let us know if you don't have these and we can ensure they are with you in plenty of time to get them sent in. You will need to include an attendance register that contains the following:

- Your centre name and number.
- The NEA paper details (name and code).
- Candidate numbers and candidate names (ensuring that candidates have used the name shown on the register).
- Whether candidates were present or absent for the assessment.
- A seating plan from the assessment sessions.

Don't forget as well to ensure that all extra sheets (up to 5 from the portfolios, should the candidates choose to include them) are securely attached to each individual answer booklet, with candidate names &amp; numbers and centre numbers clearly marked on each one. Using a treasury tag is the best way to do this, please do not staple or glue any extra answer booklets, it is much easier for us to log the statements we receive when they come

## FIELDWORK &amp; UNIT 3 NEA UPDATE:FUTURE PLANNING

It's worth a further reminder here that learners should ideally undertake two fieldwork investigations in contrasting locations for the NEA. Many of you have enquired about this recently, and we can still confirm that it is possible to do the two pieces of fieldwork in one day at the same location, for example a study on Llandudno beach in the morning and a different study in Llandudno CBD in the afternoon, if this is easier for you to organise in your centres. You are still required to complete two days of fieldwork and include these on the centre declarations, but the second day can be undertaken at any time in the year and can be used to support learning during the course for example.

For those of you planning ahead now the current NEA is complete, for the 2026 series (assessed in Autumn 2025), learners should focus on the Methodological Approach of Use of Transects and the Conceptual Framework of Inequality. The guidance slides for these two themes have been updated and are now available on the WJEC GCSE Geography website in English and Welsh. This is the final time that the NEA will be assessed before the new specification comes in next year so good luck with your planning and we hope these fieldwork projects are successful for you. We are also now involved as a GcsE team with the GA National Plan for Geography fieldwork, a potentially very exciting new scheme initiatives like central fieldwork hubs and groups to share trips and ideas may be developed. We will keep you updated about this via the newsletters, websites and CPD events.

## NEW WJEC GEOGRAPHY GCSE SPECIFICATION &amp; RESOURCES UPDATE

You will all be aware by now of the new specification starting in 2025. A lot of work has gone into getting it ready to go and we would like to extend our thanks to everyone who has taken part in all the many different stages of its development. The Specification document is available on the website, as are the Specimen Assessment Materials. We have four very detailed Guidance for Teaching (GFT) documents, written by the Unit writers, covering all 4 Units ready to be published in January. There will also be the Pan-Wales These will involve all schools in one area closing for a day and coming together in cluster events, all locations and details will be published on the website and available from your schools nearer the time. Finally, new Blended Learning documents are being uploaded to the website now in preparation for teaching the new specification in September 2025. These will be editable, so you can adapt them to the location of and expertise within your the subject of our Blended Learning resources before. These new resources can be accessed here: Geography - Educational Resources - WJEC.

## GACONFERENCE2O25

Another reminder for your diaries - the 2025 Geographical Association Conference will be held from 15th to 17th April at Oxford Brookes University. We will be there as always with a stand and subject representatives. It's always an excellent event and is invaluable CPD so it would be great to see a lot of Welsh Geographers there.

## DIGITAL RESOURCES (CURRENT SPECIFICATION)

We always encourage you to visit the Digital Resources website (https://resources.wjec.co.uk/) to access a variety of resources that can be used to support learning and teaching of current spec GCSE Geography in the classroom or as part of a blended/flipped learning programme. Fiona Rennie (our GCSE Geography working on these resources to try and make them more accessible to centres and to Blended Learning resources and Knowledge Organisers and has linked them to key questions within the specification, so you can quickly and easily find the correct resource for any part of the specification you want. This will be available on the website in the new year. Our online 2024 exam feedback presentations for Units 1, 2 and 3 can be found on the website, with specific feedback on all papers and annotated exemplars for you to use u punog a ueo samsue aidwexa asauh asns sue ooed wexa pue uosssan nor u! separate document on the website as well, in the Exemplar Material section.

## EXAMININGFOR WJEC

There are opportunities to become an appointee and examine for WJEC &amp; Eduqas in summer 2025. As an Examiner, you will gain invaluable insight into the assessment process at WJEC, enhance your skill set, and increase your understanding of the subject content.

In 2024 we had, for the first time in a long time, more examiners than we needed for the WJEC exams. We had some Welsh examiners marking Eduqas A Components 1 and 2 (as the content and question styles are exactly the same, these papers also make excellent WJEC revision and practice resources) and may do s0 again in 2025. We will however have opportunities to examine for WJEC in the new specification in 2026 and beyond, s0 please apply and if you are offered Eduqas examining then look on it as excellent CPD and preparation for when we review the teams and advertise for further examiners, in welsh and English papers, for 2026.

All examiner training conferences in 2025 will be held online via Teams. We welcome Welsh medium applications. Please register your interest now. Full details can be found on
