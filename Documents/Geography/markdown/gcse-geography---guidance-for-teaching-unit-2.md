#### <span id="page-3-0"></span>Introduction

The WJEC GCSE Geography has been approved by Qualifications Wales and is available to all centres in Wales. It will be awarded for the first time in Summer 2027, using grades A\* to G.

#### <span id="page-3-1"></span>Aims of the Guidance for Teaching

The principal aim of the Guidance for Teaching is to support teachers in the delivery of WJEC GCSE Geography and to offer guidance on the requirements of the qualification and the assessment process. The Guidance for Teaching is **not intended as a comprehensive reference**, but as support for teachers to develop stimulating and exciting courses tailored to the needs and skills of their learners. The guide offers possible classroom activities and links to useful resources (including our own, freely available digital materials and some from external sources) to provide ideas for immersive and engaging lessons.

#### <span id="page-3-2"></span>Additional ways that WJEC can offer support:

- sample assessment materials and mark schemes
- professional learning events
- examiners' reports on each unit
- direct access to the subject officer
- free online resources
- Exam Results Analysis
- Online Examination Review

{4}------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="page-4-0"></span>Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE Geography consists of 4 units. The qualification is unitised and does not contain tiering. Aside from Unit 1, which is an introductory unit, there is no hierarchy to the order the units should be taught.

|  | Unit title | Type of Assessment | Weighting |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------|
| Unit 1 | Our Physical and Human World | Written examination | 30% |
| Unit 2 | Developing Fieldwork Skills | Non examination assessment | 25% |
| Unit 3 | Our Dynamic and Diverse World | Written examination | 30% |
| Unit 4 | Sustainable Solutions | Non examination assessment | 15% |

#### <span id="page-6-0"></span>Overview of Unit 2

#### **Developing Fieldwork Skills**

Non-examination assessment – Fieldwork enquiry Set and marked by WJEC 25% of qualification 90 marks

The purpose of this unit is to:

- explore both fieldwork and skills
- develop an understanding of the six-stage enquiry model.

Learners should also develop their mathematical and statistical skills whilst preparing for this Unit. The depth of coverage required of these skills is given in Appendix B on pages 44-45 of the specification.

#### **Assessment overview**

For this assessment learners are required to undertake a fieldwork enquiry following the sixstage enquiry process.

The assignment, which includes several tasks, will be issued to centres in an Assessment Pack via the WJEC portal. Tasks are not intended to change for the lifetime of the qualification. The two selected themes will change annually. Centres can select **one** of the two themes. The themes are published in the Assessment Pack for Unit 2 for five years. This will be updated to ensure there are always five years' worth of themes to allow for forward planning. Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the year learners undertake the assignment. However, it is important that centres select the topic from the year that they plan to submit the work for marking as this may be different to the year that the candidates undertake the assessment. If candidates choose to resit this unit later, they must undertake a fieldwork enquiry for one of themes selected for the academic year they are submitting.

This assessment contributes to 25% of the overall qualification grade and will take 7 hours for candidates to complete the tasks (this does not include the time it takes to undertake the fieldwork). The tasks will be marked out of a total of 90 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be set and marked by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be handwritten and scanned or completed digitally).

Centres will be expected to carry out fieldwork for the Unit 2 enquiry on one day, outside the classroom and school grounds. This must be accompanied by a fieldwork statement, signed by the Head of Centre, outlining the date, location and nature of the fieldwork conducted. Centres are encouraged to undertake further fieldwork during the course, either to support learning or to practice for the Unit 2 enquiry, however this is not required to be declared on the fieldwork statement.

| 2.1.1 The six-stage enquiry process | Learners should know the six-stage enquiry process. Learners should understand how: <ul><li>each stage supports other stages in the process</li><li>to select a topic for enquiry.</li></ul> | It is intended that learners are formally taught the content of this unit before they embark on designing and carrying out their own fieldwork enquiry. The aim is for learners to become independent, balanced and sympathetic geographers who would have the confidence and skills to investigate their local environment. Therefore, learning each stage of the 6-stage enquiry process is integral to this. 2.1.1 is an overview of the enquiry process. Learners should know the order in which to carry out a fieldwork investigation, what a 6-stage enquiry is, and the purpose of each stage. Learners should also understand how each stage supports/impacts on all subsequent stages and therefore the importance of early decisions made. See resource: https://geography.org.uk/wp content/uploads/2023/05/NEA_Geographical_investigations_split_to_A4.01.pdf It will also be helpful to share with learners at this stage the concept that the centre has selected for the cohort. As the rest of the unit is taught, examples and discussions could be based around this concept. This will help learners to select a topic within the concept to focus their enquiry on. Learners could be shown some examples of successful geographical enquiries so that they can visualise what they are working towards. Learning activities may include: <ul><li>Explain how planning and data collection can influence conclusions in an enquiry.</li><li>Look through a good quality enquiry report (e.g. from the legacy specification) and highlight what impacts the decisions made during the</li></ul> |

#### 2.1.3 Using maps to locate and plan the enquiry

Learners should be able to plan an enquiry by:

- using appropriate Ordnance Survey (OS) maps to locate fieldwork study sites using four and six figure grid references, ensuring that they have all the correct information (for example, scale, north arrow, key and title)
- interpreting available and relevant Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data.

Learners should be familiar with using and interpreting Ordnance Survey (OS) maps from learning in Unit 1 to inform their understanding about places. It would therefore be useful to teach a quick recap of these skills focusing on the use of grid references and interpreting both physical and human features on the map.

Learners should be taught what makes a good site to collect fieldwork data and all the factors that should be taken into consideration such as representative samples, demands of the enquiry question, health and safety and time constraints.

Learners should also be shown different types of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data and shown how these can contribute to a fieldwork enquiry such as heat maps across a city or using a GPS app to find the exact location that you planned to collect data on a beach.

Teachers should emphasise the value of using GIS to enhance the accuracy of learner's fieldwork outcomes.

Learning activities may include:

- Give learners two extracts of OS maps and ask them to describe the human and physical landscapes they see.
- Put an OS map extract on the whiteboard and ask learners to identify potential study sides for 3 different fieldwork investigations. Class discussion on whether the identified locations are appropriate or not.
- Provide learners with 2 different types of GIS information and brainstorm as a class how these can be used in fieldwork.

{12}------------------------------------------------

#### 2.1.4 Risk and constraint considerations

#### Learners should be able to:

- recognise what safety risks need consideration in the field and suggest strategies that will reduce these risks
- recognise the need to be sympathetic geographers, by recognising ethical considerations, including human rights and diversity, when investigating the world around them
- consider the impact of other restrictions on data collection, such as:
  - accessibility
  - availability of secondary data
  - equipment
  - time
  - travel.

Elements of section 2.1.4 could be taught alongside 2.1.3.

Learners should be taught that all primary data collection activities should be assessed for risk, which is usually in the form of a risk assessment. Discussions should be had on how to reduce these risks whilst still being able to achieve the objectives of the enquiry.

Different types of risks should be considered, reminding learners that they need to be sympathetic geographers who make ethical considerations. Risks to themselves, members of the public and the environment should all be considered.

Learners should be aware that when they carry out their own investigation they will have a limited period in which to collect data and therefore it is important to consider these before planning an investigation. Primary data collection sites need to be accessible, safe and have permission from the landowner if not public land.

Within the context of the chosen concept, learners should know what equipment is available to them from the centre and how this will impact their enquiry design.

Learning activities may include:

- Give learners a partially completed risk assessment for a fieldwork activity. Ask learners to complete the risk to themselves/public/environment columns or the mitigating risk column.
- Class discussion about what sympathetic geographers and ethical consideration are. This could also be done in small groups who are provided with a fieldwork context and the groups are to list the necessary considerations.
- On a given topic e.g. speed of river flow, learners need to write down different ways in which this could be measured including equipment required.

Learners need to be able to choose sampling sites which will provide them with the data they require to complete their enquiry. They should be taught what makes a good/bad site. Teachers should illustrate the impact that different sample sizes can have on the outcomes of an enquiry and the importance of balancing time with gaining a representative and inclusive sample. Learners need to understand the four different methods of sampling and the decisions that are involved in deciding which method to use. Learners should be able to evaluate each one and apply it where relevant to their chosen enquiry. Learning activities may include: <ul><li>Learners to work in small groups.

{14}------------------------------------------------

#### 2.2.2 Methods of collecting primary data

Learners should be able to:

- design primary data collection sheets
- select and use fieldwork equipment to gain accurate and reliable results
- select and use quantitative data collection techniques
- select and use qualitative data collection techniques
- justify the choice of the data collection methods used.

When planning their data collection methods, learners should be encouraged to look at their enquiry question/hypothesis and decide what type of data would help them to answer this question. Then when considering the equipment and time available, they can decide on what data they are going to collect.

Learners should design their own data recording sheets. Thought should be given as to how the data is going to be used which may influence how it is recorded. Therefore, it might be useful to consider section 2.3 when designing recording sheets.

To know what field equipment to select, learners will need to know what instruments measure which data and what equipment centres are able to access. It might be helpful for centres to share equipment in order that learners have the choice of as wide a range of equipment as possible.

Learners need to know the type of data collection techniques (within the context of the chosen concept) ahead of making decisions on what data to collect. Centres should provide opportunities for this within the classroom or school grounds illustrating how and why certain equipment is used. This will allow learners to make an informed choice.

Learners should be taught what quantitative and qualitative data is and how these are used together to produce valid quality data that informs conclusions. For example when investigating flow of people within an urban area, in addition to carrying out a pedestrian count (quantitative data) at various locations, learners could also interview (qualitative data) which might provide some of the reasons behind the quantitative data.

The skill of justification is going to be very important throughout the geographical enquiry and therefore this is something that learners should be taught how to do. In the context of data collection, learners should be able to justify every method of data collection they use and relate this to their enquiry question/hypothesis.

Learning activities may include:

• Describe a primary data collection technique to learners who then need to

{15}------------------------------------------------

|  |  | design a data recording sheet for this data. <ul><li>Split the class into groups. Give each group a fieldwork context. For that context give the learners 6 different methods of collecting data. Learners can then identify each as qualitative or quantitative and write a justification as to why each piece of data would be helpful in the given context.</li><li>Learners to practice using fieldwork equipment within the grounds of the school – in particular equipment that is relevant to the concept that has been chosen by the school.</li></ul> |

| 2.2.3 Methods of collecting secondary data | Learners should be able to: <ul><li>find, select and use relevant secondary data</li><li>ensure the secondary data used adds value to their study in terms of:</li><li>context</li><li>comparison with primary data</li><li>understanding the reliability and validity of secondary data.</li></ul> | It is important that learners understand that secondary data can be just as important as primary data in the context of a geographical enquiry, and it should not be seen as a 'bolt on' piece of evidence. However, to add value, learners need to ensure that secondary data is relevant to their study and furthers understanding. Learners should also have an appreciation of the different ways in which secondary data can be used: <ul><li>Is the purpose of the secondary data to inform the reader about the location of study? For example, OS maps, meteorological office data, images from www.geograph.org.uk.</li><li>Does the enquiry require a comparison over time and therefore the secondary data is providing that comparison? For example, a previous year's data collection sheets.</li><li>Does the secondary data provide context to the wider geographical conditions? For example, statista.com, census data. Centres should also show learners how to assess as to the reliability and validity of the secondary data they have found. They should encourage learners to ask questions such as:</li><li>Who collected this data and why?</li><li>Does the person/organisation have an agenda/message that they want to convey which the data appears to be supporting?</li><li>Was the data collected likely to be accurate or is there a high chance of errors? (Professionally collected or by a previous learner)</li></ul> |

{16}------------------------------------------------

Learning activities may include:

- Split the class into small groups. Give each group a different geographical topic to explore. Give the groups 10 minutes to find as many sources as possible of secondary data for that topic. At the end of the 10 minutes the groups swap the information, and each group then must assess the validity and reliability of each secondary data source the previous group had found.
- Give learners three pieces of secondary evidence on a local topic, learners need to look at the secondary data and explain to the class why they would or would not use this data.

Selecting the most appropriate way to process data is going to be very important for learners when they are drawing their conclusions and therefore it is important they are taught a range of techniques. At the very least learners should be able to: <ul><li>Plot, measure and draw distances on a map – this might be required during the planning stage of the enquiry or during analysis of data e.g. calculating the distance travelled by the river between two data collection sites.

# 2.3.2 Selecting and using appropriate presentation methods for quantitative and qualitative data

Learning activities may include:

- give learners OS map extracts and ask them to calculate various distances on the map
- give learners five sets of varying data, they must select two types of statistical analysis to carry out on the data and provide reasoned judgements as to why those techniques were appropriate
- provide learners with a context, then ask them research a geographical statistical analysis that could be applied to the data.

#### Learners should be able to:

- identify the strengths and weaknesses of different forms of data presentation
- select and use appropriate maps
- select and use appropriate graphs
- select and use appropriate qualitative data such as focus group transcripts, field sketches or photographs.

Like the processing of data, it is also important for learners to select and accurately apply appropriate data presentation techniques for both their quantitative and qualitative data. The presentation of data has a great impact on the visualisation of trends and flows and therefore should be selected carefully.

It is also important to note that learners are not required to present every piece of data that has been recorded – the 'selecting' applies not only to the data presentation method but also to which sets of data they decide to present. This should be decided upon through the value that the data brings in being able to answer the key question/hypothesis of the enquiry. Only present data that is relevant.

For quantitative data there are numerous types of graphs and maps which help to illustrate trends and patterns, and the decision over which to include will depend on the type of data collected.

Appropriate graphs that might be considered include:

- bar graph used to present discrete data
- histogram represents data that is discrete or continuous
- line graph used to present continuous data
- scatter graph used to show the relationship between two sets of data
- pie chart used to show data represented as segments of a circle
- kite diagram a graph that shows the frequency of a factor along a transect
- pictograms a graph where the frequency of an image indicates the value of a factor
- star and radial graphs a graph that shows multiple variables on more than one axis

{19}------------------------------------------------

- triangular graphs a graph that displays three different components
- dispersion graphs illustrates the range of variables within a data set
- cross sections and transects a line graph which shows a visual representation of the cross section/transect being measured.

Appropriate mapping techniques that might be considered include:

- choropleth map a map that uses colour to show a variable
- isoline map a map that uses lines to join points of equal value
- flow line map a map that shows movement from one location to another
- proportional symbols map a map with symbols of different sizes that represent data at certain locations.

Learners should also explore different ways of displaying qualitative data. For each strategy, learners should be shown how to display and what is required.

Appropriate qualitative data presentation techniques that might be considered include:

- annotated sketch maps a simplified drawing of a landscape with explanations of features/processes
- annotated photographs a photograph of a study site with added explanations of features/processes
- transcripts from interviews a written record of an interview
- word clouds displays the frequency of keywords mentioned during interviews.

#### Learning activities may include:

- Put various examples of different types of graphs or maps on the whiteboard. Ask learners to identify the name of the technique and what type of data it can be used with.
- Provide learners with examples of data sets and ask them to present the data using one of the techniques (that is applicable to the concept they will be investigating).
- Put a photograph on the whiteboard and ask learners to come up and add annotations of things that they see.
- Take learners out into the school grounds and ask them to draw a field sketch map of what they see. On returning to the classroom, ask them to add annotations.

{20}------------------------------------------------

#### 2.3.3 Referencing secondary data sources

- Learners should be able to present secondary data in an appropriate way
- consider if stakeholders have a vested interest when reflecting on the reliability of secondary data
- accurately reference all sources of secondary data by citing sources, using a bibliography/resource list.

When learners decide which secondary data they wish to include in their enquiry, consideration should be given to how this is to be presented. Centres should discuss the benefits of presenting secondary data in the format it was found and presenting it in a different format. Ultimately this will depend on the data being considered.

It is important that learners are taught how to consider vested interests and bias in secondary data. They should know what stakeholders are and what influence they might have in how the data is presented.

Learners should be taught what a bibliography is, what it should contain and how to reference secondary resources accurately

Learning activities may include:

- Give the learners a data set. Ask one half of the class to present it to show one viewpoint and the other half to present it to show the opposite viewpoint. Discuss this, and link to how data can be made to show what the writer wants it to show. Discuss ways of avoiding this situation.
- Give the learners several quotes on a topic e.g. different viewpoints on building new houses in a small village. Learners are to recognise the bias in each of the quotes and explain why this person might have this view.
- Give learners several secondary resources (both physical and digital) and ask them to create a bibliography.

| 2.6.1 Evaluating each stage of the enquiry process | Learners should be able to evaluate each stage of the enquiry, including: <ul><li>planning the enquiry</li><li>collecting evidence</li><li>processing and presenting data</li><li>analysing and applying data</li><li>drawing conclusions.</li></ul> | Learners should be taught how to evaluate – weigh up the advantages and disadvantages and draw a conclusion. They should consider accuracy, reliability and bias. Learners should evaluate each stage of the enquiry process. They should consider what worked well, what didn't work well and what impacts this had on future stages of the enquiry process. Learning activities may include: <ul><li>Split the class into five groups. Give one example of an enquiry per group. Each group has five minutes to evaluate one section of the enquiry and then the group moves to the next enquiry and repeats the process.</li><li>Read a geographical enquiry and highlight a decision made in the planning stage. Ask the learners to look for how this decision affects the rest of the enquiry and then discuss how the enquiry would be different if a different decision had been made earlier.</li></ul> |
| 2.6.2 Identifying further areas of investigation/ questions that could now be asked | Learners should be able to identify: <ul><li>further areas of investigation inspired by their findings</li><li>geographical questions that have arisen because of their findings.</li></ul> | Section 2.6.2 could be taught alongside 2.6.1. An important part of a geographical enquiry is the 'next steps' - what could happen next to improve understanding of the concept in the local area. Learners should be taught that sometimes geography can be 'messy' and the expected outcomes do not actually occur. This should not be seen as a failure but an opportunity to carry out further investigations into factors of influence within the area being studied. Learning activities may include: <ul><li>Put a couple of examples of fieldwork conclusions on the board and have a class discussion as to what the 'next steps' for investigation might be.</li><li>Split the class into groups. Hand out a conclusion from a previous year's work. Ask each group to write down three geographical questions that arise from the conclusion.</li></ul> |

#### <span id="page-24-0"></span>Learning Experiences

Learners should be encouraged to consider the following learning experiences and skills to further develop their understanding, appreciation and awareness of the subject content. Information in the table below provides opportunities for teachers to integrate the learning experiences into delivery.

#### make appropriate use of digital technology when completing the qualification, for example through accessing satellite images and digital maps

#### **Learning Experience Exemplification of Learning Experience**

2.1.3 – Digital maps can be used to locate fieldwork data collection sites, together with providing located data which can inform where collection sites might be best located.

Learners could find and select an appropriate map of the area they are planning on studying. They could annotate the map to illustrate the location of study sites or to highlight key physical or human features that will influence the enquiry. Looking at GIS maps may also help to ensure exact locations for study sites or provide further detailed information regarding relevant characteristics at a location.

#### Digital mapping websites:

- Ordnance Survey <https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/>
- Bing maps <https://www.bing.com/maps>
- Digimap for Schools <https://digimapforschools.edina.ac.uk/>
- Google maps <https://www.google.co.uk/maps>

#### GIS websites:

- Zoopla <https://www.zoopla.co.uk/>
- Quikmaps <https://quikmaps.com/>
- Magic <https://magic.defra.gov.uk/>
- Wundermap <https://www.wunderground.com/wundermap>
- ArcGIS online <https://www.arcgis.com/index.html>

2.3.1 – When processing information, learners want to increase the clarity of data so that patterns or trends can be identified. Use of digital maps can increase the accuracy of measuring distance between collection sites or measuring distance to key influencing features.

Digital calculators can also be used to help learners apply statistical techniques to their data such as mean, mode, median, percentages.

#### Digital calculator websites:

- Calculator.net <https://www.calculator.net/>
- Calculator soup <https://www.calculatorsoup.com/>
- 2.3.2 The presentation of data allows for many opportunities to use digital technology to enhance the ability to see patterns and trends.

Therefore, when teaching learners about risk assessments and what should be considered possible themes may include: • how to engage with the public if you want to ask them questions. • being polite if people do not want to engage in questions and thanking those that do • general behaviour and noise levels when in the community • when taking measurements be aware of getting in the way of other members of the public • ensuring any questionnaire/interview designs are inclusive. 2.2.1 – When choosing data collection sites and sampling methods, it should be remembered that the sample of data that is collected should reflect the whole population. Therefore, when sampling features of the population that visit an area, it is important to consider characteristics such as age, ethnicity, gender. Learners need to ensure that unconscious bias does not skew their results. participate in educational visits (other than fieldwork) in person or digitally Opportunities arise throughout Unit 2 for educational visits, both in person and digitally. During the planning stage Google Earth photographs can be used to observe potential study sites suitability. They may also be used as a reinforcement of the wider geographical concepts that are referred to in the analysis and conclusion stages. Pilot visits may also be carried out to practice using equipment or to check on the feasibility of recording sheets/sampling method. engage in collaborative working All sections of Unit 2, during the teaching of skills, and the collection of data in the field.

#### Opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales

#### **Curriculum for Wales Strands**

#### **Cross-cutting Themes**

**There are many opportunities to include Local, National and International Contexts in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because geography encourages them to think about their sense of cynefin and their sense of belonging to the UK and the wider world. These can be explored through real life case studies in Wales, the UK and from around the world across the different themes in the specification and can help to ensure that learners are knowledgeable about their culture, community, society and the world, now and in the past.**

**Below are some examples of how Local, National and International Contexts can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

|  | 2.5.1 | Drawing conclusions from fieldwork enquiries | River study - How does river discharge change from source to mouth? Urban study – Has the number of vacant shops increased in X town or city centre? Coastal study – How do variables x, y and z change inland along the X sand dunes? |  |

{27}------------------------------------------------

|  |  |  | It is important to ensure that the fieldwork study location increases the learner's sense of cynefin. For example, for centres that are not near the coast, would learners still have a sense of cynefin when they are at the seaside? In both these studies, learners will have the opportunity to: <ul><li>measure and observe local features</li><li>observe OS maps to learn more about possible factorss that might influence features</li><li>carry out data collection and experience geography in the field</li><li>compare results with wider geographical theories in national or international contexts and consider these when thinking about further questions.</li></ul> |

|  | There are many opportunities to include Sustainability in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because considering the sustainability of their actions in relation to global issues such as climate change, deforestation, over-abstraction of resources and population growth have never been more important than they are now. Learners should be encouraged to think how their actions now may relate to the sustainability of life on earth for future generations, something that could and should be considered across all the different themes in the specification. This gives them the chance to become ethical and informed citizens of Wales and the world, showing their commitment to the sustainability of the planet. Below are some examples of how Sustainability can be embedded into teaching and learning: |  |  |

| 2.1.4 | Risk and constraint considerations (Risk assessments should contain actions to ensure that learners are sympathetic and ethical geographers who consider their impact on people and the environment when carrying out data | Examples include: <ul><li>Environment – 'Tourists have a great impact on footpath erosion in National Parks' prove or disprove.</li><li>Place and Space – 'The coastal defences at X have had more negative than positive impacts on communities.' Prove or disprove.</li><li>Place and Space – 'The improvements made to X town centre have been positive in increasing visitor numbers to the town'. Prove or disprove. The aim of any data collection activity is to collect/observe the information needed without having any impact on the local community or environment. To be sympathetic and ethical geographers, learners could consider some of the following points in their risk assessment:</li><li>polluting the environment – rubbish, noise, overcrowding</li><li>inconveniencing local communities – ensuring that geographers being in the environment does not get in the way of locals carrying out their usual activities</li><li>politeness and courtesy not to offend communities</li></ul> |

{29}------------------------------------------------

**There are many opportunities to include Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because through the study of people and places in geography, a range of different views and ideologies will be encountered, increasing knowledge of these views and encouraging learners to have fair and unbiased opinions based on what they learn. This will help them develop secure values, establish their spiritual and ethical beliefs and an appreciation of other people's values and views, both locally, nationally and around the world.**

**Below are some examples of how RSE can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

| Relationships and Sexuality Education | 2.2.2 | Methods of collecting primary data | If questionnaires/interviews are appropriate to the enquiry, learners will have the opportunity to explore feelings, thoughts and views or members of the community. This will give them insight and understanding of other people's experiences and perspectives. Using both quantitative and qualitative techniques of collecting data can help learners find out more about people's views, feelings and thoughts. Questions might include: <ul><li>how did you feel when the floodwater overflowed the river channel?</li><li>what do you think of the new channel flood defences?</li><li>in your opinion, has the increased amount of CCTV in town X improved safety for residents?</li></ul> |

{30}------------------------------------------------

**There are many opportunities to include Human Rights Education and Diversity in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because it is vital to consider them when studying key current topics such as migration, settlement growth, and equality of access to resources. Past, present and future issues linked to human rights and diversity must be considered when considering people, places and their interactions between them. Through this, learners can be educated to tackle ignorance and misinformation around this subject and to respect the needs and rights of others, as a member of a diverse society. Below are some examples of how Human Rights Education and Diversity can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

|  | Below are some examples of how Human Rights Education and Diversity can be embedded into teaching and learning: |  |  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  | Specification Reference | Amplification | Example |
|  | 2.1.2 | Posing enquiry questions | Learners can consider Human Rights Education and Diversity as part of their enquiry hypothesis or key questions. |
| Human Rights |  |  | All the concepts which form the basis of the geographical enquiry could have a human rights and diversity focus. |
| Education and |  |  | Examples include: |
| Diversity |  |  | <ul><li>Diversity – 'What are the differences in socio-economic characteristics of area A compared to area B in town X?'</li><li>Place and Space – 'What are the main pull factors for in-migration to city X?'</li></ul> |

|  |  | Ensure sampling of human responses are representative and inclusive of all parts of a diverse community. |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2.2.1 | Selecting locations and sampling | Learners need to consider the impact of their sampling methods on ensuring they collect valid and representative data. |
|  |  | When sampling people, to ensure the true diversity of the population, stratified sampling may have more successful outcomes than random or opportunistic sampling. |
|  |  | Stratified would allow for the data collected to be proportional and representative of the whole. For example, create sub-groups of the population by age and ask an equal number of people per age group to provide the data required. |
| 2.2.2 | Methods of collecting primary data | Carrying out fieldwork in their local community allows learners to foster a sense of cynefin and provides a greater understanding of their local environment. |
|  |  | It should be encouraged that learners focus their geographical enquiry in an area that is local to them, or they are familiar with. Their research and conclusions will help them understand the processes and features that they interact with in greater depth as well as understanding decision making in their communities. |
| 2.6.1 | Evaluating each stage of the enquiry process | Learners are required to form their own views and conclusions from research and evidence that they have collected. |
|  |  | The geographical enquiry is an individual piece of work and therefore it allows learners to form their own views and draw their own conclusions from the data they have gathered. In doing this, learners will be able to make judgements and provide reasoning for these judgements. Reflective evaluation is also required on how valid their findings are. |

{32}------------------------------------------------

*2.6.2 Identifying further areas of investigation/questions that could now be asked*

> *(Learners can apply knowledge to different contexts by building on their investigation results to generate more geographical questions)*

For example, in an investigation into the different cultural facilities in town X learners might gain an improved insight into the needs and preferences of other members of the community who are different to themselves (such as by age, gender, religion). From this data they may reflect and discover certain areas of the community are catered for more than others and be able to reflect on how they feel about it.

In the evaluation stage of the geographical enquiry, learners are not only reflective but would also consider what the next stages may be if they were to continue their research. Can they link their study to the wider world and how can their enquiry transcend the local area?

Questions they may ask are:

- Are my conclusions the same as my predicted outcomes?
- If my conclusions are different, what makes them different? Why are they different?
- What makes my study site unique?
- How are my findings similar/different to the wider geographical theories?
- What information would I like to find out next which would increase my understanding of this topic/my local area?
- Could I do this study elsewhere in the UK or abroad?

{33}------------------------------------------------

**There are many opportunities to include Career and Work-Related Experiences (CWRE) in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because many will go on to future careers in a world increasingly dominated by key geographical issues such as climate change and management of resources. Learners must be equipped with the knowledge and skills to understand these issues and to fire their interest in taking on a career that will make a positive difference to a sustainable future. Signposting opportunities like this is the first step to producing enterprising, creative contributors who are ready to play a full part in life and work.**

**Below are some examples of how CWRE can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

|                  |                     | Below are some examples of how CWRE can be embedded into teaching and learning: |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

This experience could then be applied in future workplaces) Methods of collecting primary data (Learners will have authentic experiences in the field when collecting their primary data. This experience would be applicable to many careers such as working for National Rivers Authority, environmental health, town planning) | Learners are required to carry out their geographical investigation individually and therefore make their own decisions with regards to methodology. One way in which these skills could be developed is: <ul><li>put a photograph on the whiteboard</li><li>pose a geographical question relating to the photograph</li><li>ask learners to list five pieces of data they would want to have about the location to answer the geographical question</li><li>apply restrictions to the data collection (e.g. time, money, safety) and ask learner to ensure their data collection ideas comply with these</li><li>group/class discussion as to what methods are suitable. Experiencing geography in practice will deepen learners understanding compared to classroom-based learning. To prepare them for this, learners could experience practice fieldwork first, this could include:</li><li>Carry out a pedestrian count at locations around the school. Experience firsthand how difficult it is to count large volumes of people moving in different directions and come up with a solution to this.</li></ul> |

{34}------------------------------------------------

|  |  | <ul><li>Carry out an ecosystems study in the school grounds. Experience using quadrats and the decisions required on where to place them, how to count species/numbers of plants, how to record the ones you can't identify, etc.</li></ul> |

#### **Cross-curricular Skills – Literacy**

**There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because need to be able to communicate effectively in different forms and settings, through both Welsh and English. Learners must be able to write and present succinctly and in depth when required to outline their knowledge and views, make ethical and informed decisions on a range of subjects, write and present fieldwork investigations and explain the concepts they are learning about. Learners should take delight in reading on a range of subjects inside and out of their academic subjects such as geography. This will then prepare them for further study and future careers where these skills will be vital as they get ready to play a full part in life and work.**

**Below are some examples of how Literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

| Listening | 2.2 2.4 | Collecting evidence (If interacting with the public to gather information, learners are required to listen carefully to responses) Analysing and applying evidence | When carrying out questionnaires or interviews with members of the public to gather primary data, learners will need to listen carefully in order or record their responses correctly, or when playing back any records of interviews at stage four of the process so that they transcribe all relevant information. To help learners develop this skill: <ul><li>play the class a recording of someone talking (just audio or with visuals as well, no longer than five minutes) and the class just need to sit and listen</li><li>then ask the class to write down the answers to questions that you will ask them once the recording has finished playing</li><li>give the class the answers so they can mark their responses</li><li>reflect with the class why they may have got some answers incorrect and how they could improve their listening skills.</li></ul> |

| Reading | 2.2.3 | Methods of collecting secondary data (Reading sources of secondary data and selecting appropriate information that would help the enquiry) | Reading newspaper articles, government websites, etc. are all valuable ways of providing more data to geographical enquiries. Being able to read through vast quantities of information quickly to establish if they are relevant or not is useful skill. This could be developed by: <ul><li>providing learners with a one-page piece of writing e.g. newspaper article</li><li>put an enquiry heading on the board</li><li>give the learners a short (but appropriate depending on ability) time to read/skim read the article</li><li>class discussion over what information form the article are relevant to the enquiry.</li></ul> |
|  | Specification Reference | Amplification | Example |
|  | 2.2.2 | Methods of collecting primary data | Learners will need to communicate effectively with each other and the public when collecting their primary data. |
|  |  |  | Learners need to be aware of the pace, volume and language of speech that they use when collecting data at fieldwork locations. |
| Speaking |  |  | Learners could carry out a pilot survey with members of staff or learners from another class to see how well they are understood. Once all questions have been asked and answered, the person answering the questions could provide feedback. |
|  |  |  | Learners would also be required to communicate effectively with each other when collecting data. Depending on the type of data collected, it may require a small group of learners working together e.g. river survey. The team would need to communicate effectively for data to be collected in the allocated time. |

{37}------------------------------------------------

|  | Specification Reference | Amplification | Example |
|---------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  | 2.1.4 | Risk and constraint considerations (There are opportunities throughout Unit 2 that provide learners the opportunities to write for various audiences and in a range of styles. In particular: A risk assessment for collecting primary data) | Learners need to use the appropriate style of writing for the context in which they are writing. There are opportunities to develop writing skills throughout Unit 2, but the following are some examples of activities: <ul><li>give learners a partially completed risk assessment and ask them to 'fill in the gaps', ensure that the gaps are random and therefore at some point during the exercise learners will have to write something in every column</li><li>once complete, learners can go through and highlight different types of language such as instructional, evaluative.</li></ul> |
| Writing | 2.4 | Analysing and applying evidence | Provide learners with a graph which shows a clear trend. Ask learners to state what the trend is and then provide three reasons why this trend might be correct. For each reason, learners should try and add elaboration. |
|  | 2.5 | Drawing conclusions (Drawing reasoned and justified conclusions) | Provide learners with a writing frame of how to write a conclusion such as: <ul><li>revisit the enquiry questions to make these the focus of all conclusions</li><li>look at both the primary and secondary evidence collected</li><li>pull together all the relevant information that has been collected for each question</li><li>answer the enquiry question with reasoning and evidence.</li></ul> |
|  | 2.6 | Evaluating techniques (Evaluating each aspect of the enquiry and consider accuracy, bias and reliability) | Encourage learners to evaluate each stage of the enquiry model and consider what went well and what could have been improve upon. The type of questions that could be considered are: <ul><li>Is the data I have collected accurate?</li><li>Did I use the correct units of measure?</li><li>Is my method reliable?</li></ul> |

{38}------------------------------------------------

| <ul><li>Was there any other data that I could have collected that would have made my data more reliable?</li></ul> |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <ul><li>Is my data affected by bias?</li></ul> |
| <ul><li>Did I unintentionally create bias in the wording of questionnaires?</li></ul> |

{39}------------------------------------------------

#### **Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy**

**There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because using number effectively in different contexts is a key skill geographers need when learning across the topic and collecting, presenting and analysing data from fieldwork investigations. Learning to understand how to interpret data and apply mathematical concepts is a key aspect of both academic study and the world of work and provides geographers with a unique skillset that they can apply to a range of different situations.**

**Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

|  | Specification Reference | Amplification | Example |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  | 2.1.3 | Using maps to locate and plan the enquiry | Learners are required to use and interpret OS maps, using four and six figure grid references and measuring distances using the scale. Learners could revisit previous KS3 learning as a refresher as to how to read four and six figure grid references and how to use scale. Learners could be given OS maps and ask them to find various features, using grid references and the distance between places using scale. |
| Developing Mathematical Proficiency | 2.2 2.3.1 | Collecting evidence (Learners may be required to measure angles) Selecting and using appropriate quantitative and qualitative techniques | If measuring angles is likely to form part of the fieldwork enquiry (e.g. beach or river profiles), then giving learners the chance to become familiar with the equipment (such as a clinometer and ranging poles) will be beneficial. For example: <ul><li>place one ranging pole on a chair and the other on the floor with a set distance between them then use the clinometer to measure the angle</li><li>once all learners are confident in using the equipment in the classroom, then they could measure angles of elevation around the school grounds. Learners are expected to process the data that they have collected and to carry out relevant statistical analysis upon it. Basic data processing including percentages, calculating distances, and mean, median and mode should be able to be applied to most investigations.</li></ul> |

{40}------------------------------------------------

|  | 2.3.2 | Selecting and using appropriate presentation methods for quantitative and qualitative data | Processing data and applying statistical analysis to the data can help learners to see patterns and trends more clearly. Revisit statistical skills that learners should already have – percentages, mean, median, mode, range (see https://www.internetgeography.net/skills plus-baseline/skills-plus-baseline-1-statistical-skills/) For some fieldwork activities there are more specialist statistical techniques that learners might wish to explore (although these are not required). For example: Interquartile range – to look at the spread of data within the set (https://resource.download.wjec.co.uk/vtc/2017-18/17-18_2- 2/_eng/unit04/02-interquartile-range.html) Mann-Whitney U Test – to measure whether there is a significant difference between data sets (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO2MiSpnrnE) Manning's n – to calculate the roughness or friction to flow in a river channel (https://www.fsl.orst.edu/geowater/FX3/help/8_Hydraulic_Reference/Mannin g_s_Equation.htm) Learners are expected to present their data using graphs and maps appropriately. This should aid interpretation of data and patterns/trends. Learners are required to select appropriate methods of presenting data which aids its interpretation. Teachers can provide learners with a range of graphs, the type of data that they would be used for and how to draw/interpret them. GCSE Bitesize has a useful graph resource: https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z9xmdxs/revision/1 |

{41}------------------------------------------------

Appropriate graphs that might be considered include:

- bar graph used to present discrete data
- histogram represents data that is discrete or continuous
- line graph used to present continuous data
- scatter graph used to show the relationship between two sets of data
- pie chart used to show data represented as segments of a circle
- kite diagram a graph that shows the frequency of a factor along a transect
- pictograms a graph where the frequency of an image indicates the value of a factor
- star and radial graphs a graph that shows multiple variables on more than one axis.
- triangular graphs a graph that displays three different components
- dispersion graphs illustrates the range of variables within a data set
- cross sections and transects a line graph which shows a visual representation of the cross section/transect being measured.

Learners are required to select appropriate methods of presenting data on maps which aids its interpretation. Teachers can provide learners with a range of maps, the type of data that they would be used for and how to draw/interpret them.

Data can be added to base maps manually or through using digital resources: [https://geography.org.uk/curriculum-support/classroom](https://geography.org.uk/curriculum-support/classroom-practice/maps-and-mapping/working-with-digimap-school-examples/)[practice/maps-and-mapping/working-with-digimap-school-examples/](https://geography.org.uk/curriculum-support/classroom-practice/maps-and-mapping/working-with-digimap-school-examples/)

Appropriate mapping techniques that might be considered include:

- choropleth map a map that uses colour to show a variable
- isoline map a map that uses lines to join points of equal value
- flow line map a map that shows movement from one location to another
- proportional symbols map a map with symbols of different sizes that represent data at certain locations.

| Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world |  |  | Learners can carry out a pilot or small-scale study within the school grounds to learn how shape, space and position influences the geographical processes and features they might be investigating. For example, learners could take some temperature and windspeed readings at various points around the school grounds and follow up with a class discussion as to how shape, space and position affect the microclimates around the school. Learners may be required to measure angles (topic dependent). |
|  |  |  | If measuring angles is likely to form part of the fieldwork enquiry (e.g. beach or river profiles), the giving learners the chance to become familiar with the equipment (such as a clinometer and ranging poles) will be beneficial. For example: |
|  |  |  | <ul><li>place one ranging pole on a chair and the other on the floor with a set distance between them then use the clinometer to measure the angle</li><li>once all learners are confident in using the equipment in the classroom, then they could measure angles of elevation around the school grounds</li><li>when back in the classroom learners can draw out the profile of the measurements they have taken so that they have a visual representation of what they have measured.</li></ul> |

#### **Cross-curricular Skills - Digital Competence**

**There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because in an increasingly digital world, using digital technologies creatively to communicate, find and analyse information provides geographers with vital skills that set them up for future academic studies and careers. As learners become more digitally competent and aware it is vital that they channel this knowledge into using digital technologies safely and with care and apply it to a range of geographical contexts. Combining opportunities for literacy, numeracy and digital competence in Geography will allow learners to undertake research, creatively present and analyse results and evaluate critically what they find as well as express emotions through different media, ensuring they are set up to tackle future challenges and are ready to learn throughout their lives.**

**Below are some examples of how Digital Competence can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

| Citizenship | 2.2.2 | Methods of collecting primary data (The sharing of primary data could see this interaction and collaboration being developed) | As learners can collaborate when collecting their data, the sharing of data is important. Once the full enquiry is completed, learners might also want to share their findings with relevant sections of the community to inform their thinking e.g. a study investigating the flow of people through a town centre could be shared with the local council or the management company. |  |
|  | 2.3.3 | Referencing secondary data sources | Learners should know how to accurately reference all the secondary data that they have used in their enquiry in a bibliography. A guide to this can be found on GCSE Bitesize: https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zctwqty/revision/12 |  |

| Interacting and Collaborating | 2.2.2 2.3.3 | Methods of collecting primary data Referencing secondary data sources (Learners may interact or collaborate with organisations to source relevant primary data) | Learners will most likely collaborate to collect their primary data. Therefore, working as a team is the most effective way to ensure accurate data is collected in the allocated time. Ensure learners practice their role in data collection e.g. if doing a river survey, ensure each group knows who will be holding the tape measure, who will be measuring speed of flow, etc. Practice using the equipment in the classroom or on school grounds first so that it is familiar to learners. Discuss with learners afterwards the importance of collaboration and supporting each other when collecting data. If permission needs to be gained to access a location to collect primary data, involve the learners in the process of contacting the relevant organisation to gain permission for access. |

|  | Throughout Unit 2 | Unit 2 is required to be submitted digitally, and it is expected that most of the elements to the unit will be produced digitally | It is a requirement of the specification that the geographical enquiry is submitted digitally. Therefore, learners should become familiar with packages such as Microsoft Word and Excel, any specialist GIS software and how to convert documents into PDF format which will help them to produce/submit their enquiry report digitally. |
| Producing | 2.1.3 2.3.2 | Using maps to locate and plan the enquiry Selecting and using appropriate presentation methods for quantitative and qualitative data (Learners may use digital software to present their data) | Learners may use GIS data to plan and locate their collection sites. GIS software can be used to help with data collection and data presentation. It would be helpful if learners were familiar with these before they start their own enquiries so that they have the confidence to use them independently. Resources that may help with this are: <ul><li>Field studies council – https://www.field-studies council.org/resources/16-18-geography/gis/gis-for-data collection/</li><li>Royal Geographic Society – https://www.rgs.org/schools/resources-for-schools/free-gis and-maps-for-fieldwork</li><li>Geographical Association – https://geography.org.uk/support and-guidance-with-gis/</li></ul> |

| Data and Computational Thinking | 2.3.1 | Selecting and using appropriate quantitative and qualitative techniques | Learners may use digital software to process their data or to apply statistical techniques. When processing information, learners want to increase the clarity of data so that patterns or trends can be identified. Use of digital maps can increase the accuracy of measuring distance between collection sites or measuring distance to key influencing features for example. Digital calculators can also be used to help learners apply statistical techniques to their data e.g. mean, mode, median, percentages.

#### **Integral Skills** Creativity and Innovation **There are many opportunities to include Creativity and Innovation in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because geography should encourage them to connect and apply their knowledge and skills to create ideas and projects and to think creatively to make decisions and solve problems. When faced with problems to solve and decisions to make on sustainable issues, learners will be able to think about and then make choices that reflect creative ideas and innovative solutions to issues from across the geographical world and beyond. Below are some examples of how Creativity and Innovation can be embedded into teaching and learning:** *Specification Reference Amplification Example 2.1 2.2 Planning an enquiry Collecting evidence (Learners will require creativity and innovation when planning and collecting data for their enquiry)* Learners are required to plan their own geographical enquiries and decide on what data is to be collected. Learners are encouraged to be creative and innovative in when planning their enquiries: • put a stimulus photo on the board • give the learners an enquiry question • ask them to write down four pieces of data they would like to know about the enquiry focus and how they would go about gaining this information • follow with a class discussion as to what is practical to do in the time available.

{49}------------------------------------------------

**There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because the ability to critically assess resources and arrive at informed solutions to a range of problems is a vital skill learners should develop throughout their study. Learners should aim to question the validity and accuracy of resources and data across the Units in the specification and apply this when making decisions and solving problems related to the key issues they will encounter. Learners should be encouraged to enjoy questioning and solving problems and be given a range of opportunities to do so within the subject of geography.**

|  | learning: | There are many opportunities to include Planning and Organisation in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because when faced with investigations to conduct or decisions to make, learners must be able to plan their time, organise their work and meet deadlines effectively. This is a key skill for learners both in geography when faced with decision making exercises, fieldwork investigations and revision for example, and in the wider world as a part of their future life and work. Below are some examples of how Planning and Organisation can be embedded into teaching and |  |  |  |

Learners can experience this by:</li><li>Put all learners standing in a line and ask one learner to select ten people through opportunistic, random, stratified and systematic sampling. The learners could also be lined up in age/height to add greater understanding to stratified sampling. This activity could also be used to illustrate the impact of different sample sizes on outcomes.</li><li>Learners to give the advantages and disadvantages of the four methods of sampling. Learners are required to submit their work digitally and therefore this needs to be included into their planning.</li></ul> |
