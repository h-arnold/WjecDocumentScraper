Set and marked by WJEC
25% of qualification
90 marks

The purpose of this unit is to:
•  explore both fieldwork and skills
•  develop an understanding of the six-stage enquiry model.

Learners should also develop their mathematical and statistical skills whilst preparing for this
Unit. The depth of coverage required of these skills is given in Appendix B on pages 44-45 of
the specification.

Assessment overview
For this assessment learners are required to undertake a fieldwork enquiry following the six-
stage enquiry process.

The assignment, which includes several tasks, will be issued to centres in an Assessment
Pack via the WJEC portal. Tasks are not intended to change for the lifetime of the
qualification. The two selected themes will change annually. Centres can select one of the
two themes. The themes are published in the Assessment Pack for Unit 2 for five years.
This will be updated to ensure there are always five years’ worth of themes to allow for
forward planning. Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the year learners
undertake the assignment. However, it is important that centres select the topic from the
year that they plan to submit the work for marking as this may be different to the year that
the candidates undertake the assessment. If candidates choose to resit this unit later, they
must undertake a fieldwork enquiry for one of themes selected for the academic year they
are submitting.

This assessment contributes to 25% of the overall qualification grade and will take 7 hours
for candidates to complete the tasks (this does not include the time it takes to undertake the
fieldwork). The tasks will be marked out of a total of 90 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be set and marked
by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be handwritten and scanned
or completed digitally).

Centres will be expected to carry out fieldwork for the Unit 2 enquiry on one day, outside the
classroom and school grounds. This must be accompanied by a fieldwork statement, signed
by the Head of Centre, outlining the date, location and nature of the fieldwork conducted.
Centres are encouraged to undertake further fieldwork during the course, either to support
learning or to practice for the Unit 2 enquiry, however this is not required to be declared on
the fieldwork statement.

2.1 Planning an enquiry

GCSE Geography Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 10

Content Amplification

Teacher Guidance

Learners should know the six-stage enquiry process.

It is intended that learners are formally taught the content of this unit before
they embark on designing and carrying out their own fieldwork enquiry.

Learners should understand how:
•  each stage supports other stages in the process
•

to select a topic for enquiry.

The aim is for learners to become independent, balanced and sympathetic
geographers who would have the confidence and skills to investigate their local
environment. Therefore, learning each stage of the 6-stage enquiry process is
integral to this.

2.1.1 is an overview of the enquiry process. Learners should know the order in
which to carry out a fieldwork investigation, what a 6-stage enquiry is,  and the
purpose of each stage. Learners should also understand how each stage
supports/impacts on all subsequent stages and therefore the importance of
early decisions made.

See resource: https://geography.org.uk/wp-
content/uploads/2023/05/NEA_Geographical_investigations_split_to_A4.01.pdf

It will also be helpful to share with learners at this stage the concept that the
centre has selected for the cohort. As the rest of the unit is taught, examples
and discussions could be based around this concept. This will help learners to
select a topic within the concept to focus their enquiry on.

Learners could be shown some examples of successful geographical enquiries
so that they can visualise what they are working towards.

Learning activities may include:
•  Explain how planning and data collection can influence conclusions in an

enquiry.

•  Look through a good quality enquiry report (e.g. from the legacy

specification) and highlight what impacts the decisions made during the

2.1.1
The six-stage
enquiry
process

GCSE Geography Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 11

planning/data collection/ data processing and presenting stages have on
each subsequent stage of the investigation. Highlight areas of cynefin and
discuss how it relates to the chosen topic.

•  List 10 possible topics that could be investigated through the chosen

concept. Discuss and rank in order of ease of completion/suitability, to give
learners an early idea of how to create an accessible enquiry, suitable for
all learners to complete.

This area of content covers deciding on the focus and structure of the enquiry
questions. Learners should explore the different types of enquiry question
(posing a question or stating a hypothesis which is to be proved or disproved).

It might also be helpful to show learners how sub-questions can help to
breakdown the overall enquiry question into measurable components.
Learners should be shown how to justify these questions in the context of the
whole enquiry.

Learners should be taught what a predicted outcome is and why these should
be included in their geographical enquiry. What is their purpose/value?

When thinking about the context of enquiry questions it is important to
remember that an aim of this unit is to foster a sense of Cynefin for learners.

It might also be helpful to teach 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 at the same time so that
context can be given to possible questions.

Learning activities may include:
•  Learners looking out of the classroom window/in the school grounds and

write five enquiry questions relating to what they see.

•  Give learners three fieldwork questions relating to their local area and ask
them to give predicted outcomes. Learners can then swap their predicted
outcomes with a partner who would then add justification to the predictions
and highlight where cynefin is/could be addressed.

•  Give learners an example of a good enquiry question and a weak question

•

and ask them to explain why.
Identify potential sources/theories of geographical understanding that are
applicable to the chosen concept.

2.1.2
Posing
enquiry
questions

Learners should know how to pose enquiry
questions.

Learners should understand the role that enquiry
questions have in framing the enquiry process.

Learners should be able to:
•  plan and design enquiry questions within a given

topic
•
justify enquiry questions
•  give predicted outcomes
•

justify predicted outcomes with reference to
geographical knowledge and understanding.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

2.1.3
Using maps to
locate and
plan the
enquiry

Learners should be able to plan an enquiry by:
•  using appropriate Ordnance Survey (OS) maps
to locate fieldwork study sites using four and six
figure grid references, ensuring that they have
all the correct information (for example, scale,
north arrow, key and title)
interpreting available and relevant Geographical
Information Systems (GIS) data.

•

GCSE Geography Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 12

Learners should be familiar with using and interpreting Ordnance Survey (OS)
maps from learning in Unit 1 to inform their understanding about places. It
would therefore be useful to teach a quick recap of these skills focusing on the
use of grid references and interpreting both physical and human features on
the map.

Learners should be taught what makes a good site to collect fieldwork data
and all the factors that should be taken into consideration such as
representative samples, demands of the enquiry question, health and safety
and time constraints.

Learners should also be shown different types of Geographical Information
Systems (GIS) data and shown how these can contribute to a fieldwork enquiry
such as heat maps across a city or using a GPS app to find the exact location
that you planned to collect data on a beach.

Teachers should emphasise the value of using GIS to enhance the accuracy of
learner's fieldwork outcomes.

Learning activities may include:
•  Give learners two extracts of OS maps and ask them to describe the

human and physical landscapes they see.

•  Put an OS map extract on the whiteboard and ask learners to identify
potential study sides for 3 different fieldwork investigations. Class
discussion on whether the identified locations are appropriate or not.
•  Provide learners with 2 different types of GIS information and brainstorm

as a class how these can be used in fieldwork.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

Learners should be able to:
•

•

•

recognise what safety risks need consideration
in the field and suggest strategies that will
reduce these risks
recognise the need to be sympathetic
geographers, by recognising ethical
considerations, including human rights and
diversity, when investigating the world around
them
consider the impact of other restrictions on data
collection, such as:
•  accessibility
•  availability of secondary data
•  equipment
•
•

time
travel.

GCSE Geography Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 13

Elements of section 2.1.4 could be taught alongside 2.1.3.

Learners should be taught that all primary data collection activities should be
assessed for risk, which is usually in the form of a risk assessment.
Discussions should be had on how to reduce these risks whilst still being able
to achieve the objectives of the enquiry.

Different types of risks should be considered, reminding learners that they
need to be sympathetic geographers who make ethical considerations. Risks
to themselves, members of the public and the environment should all be
considered.

Learners should be aware that when they carry out their own investigation they
will have a limited period in which to collect data and therefore it is important to
consider these before planning an investigation. Primary data collection sites
need to be accessible, safe and have permission from the landowner if not
public land.

Within the context of the chosen concept, learners should know what
equipment is available to them from the centre and how this will impact their
enquiry design.

Learning activities may include:
•  Give learners a partially completed risk assessment for a fieldwork activity.

Ask learners to complete the risk to themselves/public/environment
columns or the mitigating risk column.

•  Class discussion about what sympathetic geographers and ethical
consideration are. This could also be done in small groups who are
provided with a fieldwork context and the groups are to list the necessary
considerations.

•  On a given topic e.g. speed of river flow, learners need to write down

different ways in which this could be measured including equipment
required.

2.2 Collecting evidence

Content Amplification

Teacher Guidance

GCSE Geography Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 14

Learners should understand:
•

•

•

the importance of choosing data collection
locations
the importance of obtaining representative and
inclusive samples
the process of sampling, including:
factors influencing sample size
•
the choice of sampling methods, including:
•
•  opportunistic
•
random
•  stratified
•  systematic.

Learners should be able to choose and justify:
•  data collection sites within a given area
•  sample size
•  sampling method.

Elements of section 2.2.1 (especially the first bullet point) could be taught
alongside section 2.1.3 and 2.1.4.

Learners need to be able to choose sampling sites which will provide them with
the data they require to complete their enquiry. They should be taught what
makes a good/bad site.

Teachers should illustrate the impact that different sample sizes can have on
the outcomes of an enquiry and the importance of balancing time with gaining a
representative and inclusive sample.

Learners need to understand the four different methods of sampling and the
decisions that are involved in deciding which method to use. Learners should be
able to evaluate each one and apply it where relevant to their chosen enquiry.

Learning activities may include:
•  Learners to work in small groups. They are given an OS map with six

potential study sites. They are told that there is only time to collect data from
three sites, so the groups need to identify their chosen sites and justify why.

•  Put all learners standing in a line and ask one learner to select 10 people
through opportunistic, random, stratified and systematic sampling. The
learners could also be lined up in age/height to add greater understanding to
stratified sampling. This activity could also be used to illustrate the impact of
different sample sizes on outcomes.

•  Candidates to give the advantages and disadvantages of the four methods

of sampling.

GCSE Geography Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 15

When planning their data collection methods, learners should be encouraged to
look at their enquiry question/hypothesis and decide what type of data would
help them to answer this question. Then when considering the equipment and
time available, they can decide on what data they are going to collect.

Learners should design their own data recording sheets. Thought should be
given as to how the data is going to be used which may influence how it is
recorded. Therefore, it might be useful to consider section 2.3 when designing
recording sheets.

To know what field equipment to select, learners will need to know what
instruments measure which data and what equipment centres are able to
access. It might be helpful for centres to share equipment in order that learners
have the choice of as wide a range of equipment as possible.

Learners need to know the type of data collection techniques (within the context
of the chosen concept) ahead of making decisions on what data to collect.
Centres should provide opportunities for this within the classroom or school
grounds illustrating how and why certain equipment is used. This will allow
learners to make an informed choice.

Learners should be taught what quantitative and qualitative data is and how
these are used together to produce valid quality data that informs conclusions.
For example when investigating flow of people within an urban area, in addition
to carrying out a pedestrian count (quantitative data) at various locations,
learners could also interview (qualitative data) which might provide some of the
reasons behind the quantitative data.

The skill of justification is going to be very important throughout the
geographical enquiry and therefore this is something that learners should be
taught how to do. In the context of data collection, learners should be able to
justify every method of data collection they use and relate this to their enquiry
question/hypothesis.

Learning activities may include:
•  Describe a primary data collection technique to learners who then need to

GCSE Geography Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 16

design a data recording sheet for this data.

•  Split the class into groups. Give each group a fieldwork context. For that

context give the learners 6 different methods of collecting data. Learners can
then identify each as qualitative or quantitative and write a justification as to
why each piece of data would be helpful in the given context.

•  Learners to practice using fieldwork equipment within the grounds of the

school – in particular equipment that is relevant to the concept that has been
chosen by the school.

Learners should be able to:
•
•  ensure the secondary data used adds value to

find, select and use relevant secondary data

It is important that learners understand that secondary data can be just as
important as primary data in the context of a geographical enquiry, and it should
not be seen as a ‘bolt on’ piece of evidence.

their study in terms of:
•  context
•  comparison with primary data
•  understanding the reliability and validity of

secondary data.

However, to add value, learners need to ensure that secondary data is relevant
to their study and furthers understanding. Learners should also have an
appreciation of the different ways in which secondary data can be used:
•

Is the purpose of the secondary data to inform the reader about the location
of study? For example, OS maps, meteorological office data, images from
www.geograph.org.uk.

•  Does the enquiry require a comparison over time and therefore the

secondary data is providing that comparison? For example, a previous
year’s data collection sheets.

•  Does the secondary data provide context to the wider geographical

conditions? For example, statista.com, census data.

Centres should also show learners how to assess as to the reliability and validity
of the secondary data they have found. They should encourage learners to ask
questions such as:
•  Who collected this data and why?
•  Does the person/organisation have an agenda/message that they want to

convey which the data appears to be supporting?

•  Was the data collected likely to be accurate or is there a high chance of

errors? (Professionally collected or by a previous learner)

Learning activities may include:
•  Split the class into small groups. Give each group a different geographical
topic to explore. Give the groups 10 minutes to find as many sources as
possible of secondary data for that topic. At the end of the 10 minutes the
groups swap the information, and each group then must assess the validity
and reliability of each secondary data source the previous group had found.
•  Give learners three pieces of secondary evidence on a local topic, learners
need to look at the secondary data and explain to the class why they would
or would not use this data.

2.3 Processing and presenting evidence

Content Amplification

Teacher Guidance

GCSE Geography Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 18

2.3.1
Selecting and
using
appropriate
quantitative
and
qualitative
techniques

Learners should be able to select appropriate
techniques to process evidence which aids
interpretation, including calculating:
•  distance on maps
•  median, mean, range and mode
•  percentages
•  other relevant techniques.

The way data is analysed and presented can have a large impact on how easy
or difficult it is to see patterns and trends in the data. Selecting the most
appropriate way to process data is going to be very important for learners when
they are drawing their conclusions and therefore it is important they are taught a
range of techniques.

At the very least learners should be able to:
•  Plot, measure and draw distances on a map – this might be required during
the planning stage of the enquiry or during analysis of data e.g. calculating
the distance travelled by the river between two data collection sites. It is vital
that this is done accurately and maybe done by hand using an OS map or
via a GIS system such as ArcGIS.

•  Calculating the median, mean, range and mode of a data set is a basic

statistical analysis of the data. Learners should be shown the benefits and
drawbacks of using each in addition to knowing the format the data is
required to be in for them to be able to apply the technique.

•

•  Converting data to percentages is a skill that most learners will have but
they should know why they are doing this. Does a particular statistical
technique need data as percentages? Does it help with data presentation?
In addition to the above techniques, there are many other ways to
manipulate data or apply statistical techniques which may improve
understanding of patterns and trends. These further techniques are
optional and not required to gain full marks. However, some candidates
maybe confident to apply them. Such statistical techniques will depend upon
the type of data and the context; however, some examples are:
•
Interquartile range
•  Mann-Whitney U Test
•  Manning’s n
•  Wetted perimeter

GCSE Geography Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 19

Learning activities may include:
•  give learners OS map extracts and ask them to calculate various distances

on the map

•  give learners five sets of varying data, they must select two types of
statistical analysis to carry out on the data and provide reasoned
judgements as to why those techniques were appropriate

•  provide learners with a context, then ask them research a geographical

statistical analysis that could be applied to the data.

Like the processing of data, it is also important for learners to select and
accurately apply appropriate data presentation techniques for both their
quantitative and qualitative data. The presentation of data has a great impact on
the visualisation of trends and flows and therefore should be selected carefully.

It is also important to note that learners are not required to present every piece
of data that has been recorded – the ‘selecting’ applies not only to the data
presentation method but also to which sets of data they decide to present. This
should be decided upon through the value that the data brings in being able to
answer the key question/hypothesis of the enquiry. Only present data that is
relevant.

For quantitative data there are numerous types of graphs and maps which help
to illustrate trends and patterns, and the decision over which to include will
depend on the type of data collected.

line graph – used to present continuous data

Appropriate graphs that might be considered include:
•  bar graph – used to present discrete data
•  histogram – represents data that is discrete or continuous
•
•  scatter graph – used to show the relationship between two sets of data
•  pie chart – used to show data represented as segments of a circle
•  kite diagram – a graph that shows the frequency of a factor along a transect
•  pictograms – a graph where the frequency of an image indicates the value of

a factor

•  star and radial graphs – a graph that shows multiple variables on more than

one axis

•  select and use appropriate maps
•  select and use appropriate graphs
•  select and use appropriate qualitative data such
as focus group transcripts, field sketches or

GCSE Geography Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 20

triangular graphs – a graph that displays three different components

•
•  dispersion graphs – illustrates the range of variables within a data set
•  cross sections and transects – a line graph which shows a visual
representation of the cross section/transect being measured.

Appropriate mapping techniques that might be considered include:
•  choropleth map – a map that uses colour to show a variable
•
•
•  proportional symbols map – a map with symbols of different sizes that

isoline map – a map that uses lines to join points of equal value
flow line map – a map that shows movement from one location to another

represent data at certain locations.

Learners should also explore different ways of displaying qualitative data. For
each strategy, learners should be shown how to display and what is required.

Appropriate qualitative data presentation techniques that might be considered
include:
•  annotated sketch maps – a simplified drawing of a landscape with

explanations of features/processes

•  annotated photographs – a photograph of a study site with added

explanations of features/processes
transcripts from interviews – a written record of an interview

•
•  word clouds – displays the frequency of keywords mentioned during

interviews.

Learning activities may include:
•  Put various examples of different types of graphs or maps on the

whiteboard. Ask learners to identify the name of the technique and what type
of data it can be used with.

•  Provide learners with examples of data sets and ask them to present the

data using one of the techniques (that is applicable to the concept they will
be investigating).

•  Put a photograph on the whiteboard and ask learners to come up and add

annotations of things that they see.

•  Take learners out into the school grounds and ask them to draw a field

sketch map of what they see. On returning to the classroom, ask them to
add annotations.

2.3.3
Referencing
secondary
data sources

•  Learners should be able to present secondary

data in an appropriate way

•  consider if stakeholders have a vested interest

when reflecting on the reliability of secondary
data

•  accurately reference all sources of secondary

data by citing sources, using a
bibliography/resource list.

GCSE Geography Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 21

When learners decide which secondary data they wish to include in their
enquiry, consideration should be given to how this is to be presented. Centres
should discuss the benefits of presenting secondary data in the format it was
found and presenting it in a different format. Ultimately this will depend on the
data being considered.

It is important that learners are taught how to consider vested interests and bias
in secondary data. They should know what stakeholders are and what influence
they might have in how the data is presented.

Learners should be taught what a bibliography is, what it should contain and
how to reference secondary resources accurately

Learning activities may include:
•

 Give the learners a data set. Ask one half of the class to present it to show
one viewpoint and the other half to present it to show the opposite viewpoint.
Discuss this, and link to how data can be made to show what the writer
wants it to show. Discuss ways of avoiding this situation.

•  Give the learners several quotes on a topic e.g. different viewpoints on

building new houses in a small village. Learners are to recognise the bias in
each of the quotes and explain why this person might have this view.
•  Give learners several secondary resources (both physical and digital) and

ask them to create a bibliography.

2.4 Analysing and applying evidence

GCSE Geography Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 22

Teacher Guidance

Learners should be able to select:
•  primary data which contributes to answering the

enquiry question

It is important that learners know that they need to be selective about the data
sets that they include in analysing results. Candidates should be selecting data
that contributes towards answering their enquiry question/hypothesis.

•  secondary data which contributes to answering

the enquiry question.

Both primary and secondary data should be analysed.

When selecting secondary data, if the data set is large then learners need to
know how to include just relevant sections which contribute towards their
enquiry.

Learning activities may include:
•  Give learners a range of primary and secondary data together with an

enquiry question. Ask them to select the most relevant data that can be used
to answer the enquiry question.

Learners should be able to:
•  analyse and synthesise relevant data to identify

Learners should be taught how to analyse and synthesise data so that they only
include data that specifically contributes towards their enquiry question.

patterns and trends from primary and
secondary data

•  use data to interpret and justify trends

described.

Learners should be encouraged to look for links between data sets e.g. how one
factor influences another. Detailed explanation and the use of selected extracts
of data should also be encouraged as part of justification of their analysis.

When discussing trends and patterns, learners should make specific reference
to maps or graphs. These should be in the context of answering the enquiry
question.

Learning activities may include:
•  Give learners a set of primary data and ask them to make connections

between the data. Encourage learners to interpret these connections and
describe trends/patterns in the data.

•  Provide learners with a selection of secondary data which relates to the

primary data. Class discussion as to which secondary data contributes to the
enquiry question and reinforces the primary data.

Learners should be taught how to structure a conclusion to ensure that they
answer the enquiry question/hypothesis. The structure can be guided by any
sub-questions the learner included during the planning stage of their enquiry. It
is expected that they provide reasoned judgements based on evidence that they
have collected with consideration to the wider field geographical concepts.

It would be good practice to remind learners of the relevant geographic theories
within the chosen concept so that they are able to select appropriately.

2.6.1
Evaluating
each stage of
the enquiry
process

Learners should be able to evaluate each stage of
the enquiry, including:
•  planning the enquiry
•  collecting evidence
•  processing and presenting data
•  analysing and applying data
•  drawing conclusions.

Learners should be able to identify:
•

further areas of investigation inspired by their
findings

•  geographical questions that have arisen

because of their findings.

2.6.2
Identifying
further areas
of
investigation/
questions that
could now be
asked

Learners should be taught how to evaluate – weigh up the advantages and
disadvantages and draw a conclusion. They should consider accuracy, reliability
and bias.

Learners should evaluate each stage of the enquiry process. They should
consider what worked well, what didn’t work well and what impacts this had on
future stages of the enquiry process.

Learning activities may include:
•  Split the class into five groups. Give one example of an enquiry per group.

•

Each group has five minutes to evaluate one section of the enquiry and then
the group moves to the next enquiry and repeats the process.
 Read a geographical enquiry and highlight a decision made in the planning
stage. Ask the learners to look for how this decision affects the rest of the
enquiry and then discuss how the enquiry would be different if a different
decision had been made earlier.

Section 2.6.2 could be taught alongside 2.6.1.

An important part of a geographical enquiry is the ‘next steps’ - what could
happen next to improve understanding of the concept in the local area.

Learners should be taught that sometimes geography can be ‘messy’ and the
expected outcomes do not actually occur. This should not be seen as a failure
but an opportunity to carry out further investigations into factors of influence
within the area being studied.

Learning activities may include:
•  Put a couple of examples of fieldwork conclusions on the board and have a
class discussion as to what the ‘next steps’ for investigation might be.
•  Split the class into groups. Hand out a conclusion from a previous year’s

work. Ask each group to write down three geographical questions that arise
from the conclusion.

2.1.3 – Digital maps can be used to locate fieldwork data
collection sites, together with providing located data which
can inform where collection sites might be best located.

Learners could find and select an appropriate map of the
area they are planning on studying. They could annotate the
map to illustrate the location of study sites or to highlight key
physical or human features that will influence the enquiry.
Looking at GIS maps may also help to ensure exact
locations for study sites or provide further detailed
information regarding relevant characteristics at a location.

2.1.4 – When geographers are out in the field, consideration
must be given to the community and environment that they
are in. Therefore, when teaching learners about risk
assessments and what should be considered possible
themes may include:
•  how to engage with the public if you want to ask them

questions.

•  being polite if people do not want to engage in questions

and thanking those that do

•  general behaviour and noise levels when in the

community

•  when taking measurements be aware of getting in the

2.2.1 – When choosing data collection sites and sampling
methods, it should be remembered that the sample of data
that is collected should reflect the whole population.

Therefore, when sampling features of the population that
visit an area, it is important to consider characteristics such
as age, ethnicity, gender. Learners need to ensure that
unconscious bias does not skew their results.

Opportunities arise throughout Unit 2 for educational visits,
both in person and digitally.

During the planning stage Google Earth photographs can be
used to observe potential study sites suitability. They may
also be used as a reinforcement of the wider geographical
concepts that are referred to in the analysis and conclusion

Cross-cutting Themes

GCSE Geography Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 27

There are many opportunities to include Local, National and International Contexts in GCSE Geography. These
opportunities are important to Learners because geography encourages them to think about their sense of
cynefin and their sense of belonging to the UK and the wider world. These can be explored through real life
case studies in Wales, the UK and from around the world across the different themes in the specification and
can help to ensure that learners are knowledgeable about their culture, community, society and the world, now
and in the past.

It is important to ensure that the fieldwork study location increases
the learner's sense of cynefin. For example, for centres that are not
near the coast, would learners still have a sense of cynefin when they
are at the seaside?

In both these studies, learners will have the opportunity to:
•  measure and observe local features
•  observe OS maps to learn more about possible factorss that

might influence features

•  carry out data collection and experience geography in the field
•  compare results with wider geographical theories in national or
international contexts and consider these when thinking about
further questions.

There are many opportunities to include Sustainability in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important
to Learners because considering the sustainability of their actions in relation to global issues such as climate
change, deforestation, over-abstraction of resources and population growth have never been more important
than they are now. Learners should be encouraged to think how their actions now may relate to the
sustainability of life on earth for future generations, something that could and should be considered across all
the different themes in the specification. This gives them the chance to become ethical and informed citizens of
Wales and the world, showing their commitment to the sustainability of the planet.

The aim of any data collection activity is to collect/observe the
information needed without having any impact on the local
community or environment. To be sympathetic and ethical
geographers, learners could consider some of the following points in
their risk assessment:
•  polluting the environment – rubbish, noise, overcrowding
•

inconveniencing local communities – ensuring that geographers
being in the environment does not get in the way of locals
carrying out their usual activities

•  politeness and courtesy not to offend communities
•
realising that approaching people in groups might be intimidating
•  distance travelled and method of travel to study site – air pollution

There are many opportunities to include Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in GCSE Geography.
These opportunities are important to Learners because through the study of people and places in geography, a
range of different views and ideologies will be encountered, increasing knowledge of these views and
encouraging learners to have fair and unbiased opinions based on what they learn. This will help them develop
secure values, establish their spiritual and ethical beliefs and an appreciation of other people’s values and
views, both locally, nationally and around the world.

understanding of other people’s experiences and perspectives.

Using both quantitative and qualitative techniques of collecting data
can help learners find out more about people’s views, feelings and
thoughts. Questions might include:
•  how did you feel when the floodwater overflowed the river

channel?

•  what do you think of the new channel flood defences?
•

There are many opportunities to include Human Rights Education and Diversity in GCSE Geography. These
opportunities are important to Learners because it is vital to consider them when studying key current topics
such as migration, settlement growth, and equality of access to resources. Past, present and future issues
linked to human rights and diversity must be considered when considering people, places and their
interactions between them. Through this, learners can be educated to tackle ignorance and misinformation
around this subject and to respect the needs and rights of others, as a member of a diverse society.

•  Diversity – ‘What are the differences in socio-economic

characteristics of area A compared to area B in town X?’

•  Place and Space – ‘What are the main pull factors for in-migration

2.2.1

Selecting locations and
sampling

Learners need to consider the impact of their sampling methods on
ensuring they collect valid and representative data.

Ensure sampling of human responses are representative and
inclusive of all parts of a diverse community.

When sampling people, to ensure the true diversity of the population,
stratified sampling may have more successful outcomes than random
or opportunistic sampling.

Stratified would allow for the data collected to be proportional and
representative of the whole. For example, create sub-groups of the
population by age and ask an equal number of people per age group
to provide the data required.

2.2.2

Methods of collecting primary
data

Carrying out fieldwork in their local community allows learners to
foster a sense of cynefin and provides a greater understanding of
their local environment.

It should be encouraged that learners focus their geographical
enquiry in an area that is local to them, or they are familiar with. Their
research and conclusions will help them understand the processes
and features that they interact with in greater depth as well as
understanding decision making in their communities.

2.6.1

Evaluating each stage of the
enquiry process

Learners are required to form their own views and conclusions from
research and evidence that they have collected.

The geographical enquiry is an individual piece of work and therefore
it allows learners to form their own views and draw their own
conclusions from the data they have gathered. In doing this, learners
will be able to make judgements and provide reasoning for these
judgements. Reflective evaluation is also required on how valid their
findings are.

Identifying further areas of
investigation/questions that
could now be asked

(Learners can apply
knowledge to different
contexts by building on their
investigation results to
generate more geographical
questions)

GCSE Geography Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 33

For example, in an investigation into the different cultural facilities in
town X learners might gain an improved insight into the needs and
preferences of other members of the community who are different to
themselves (such as by age, gender, religion). From this data they
may reflect and discover certain areas of the community are catered
for more than others and be able to reflect on how they feel about it.

In the evaluation stage of the geographical enquiry, learners are not
only reflective but would also consider what the next stages may be if
they were to continue their research. Can they link their study to the
wider world and how can their enquiry transcend the local area?

Questions they may ask are:
•  Are my conclusions the same as my predicted outcomes?
•

If my conclusions are different, what makes them different? Why
are they different?

•  What makes my study site unique?
•  How are my findings similar/different to the wider geographical

theories?

•  What information would I like to find out next which would
increase my understanding of this topic/my local area?

•  Could I do this study elsewhere in the UK or abroad?

There are many opportunities to include Career and Work-Related Experiences (CWRE) in GCSE Geography.
These opportunities are important to Learners because many will go on to future careers in a world
increasingly dominated by key geographical issues such as climate change and management of resources.
Learners must be equipped with the knowledge and skills to understand these issues and to fire their interest
in taking on a career that will make a positive difference to a sustainable future. Signposting opportunities like

•  pose a geographical question relating to the photograph
•  ask learners to list five pieces of data they would want to have

about the location to answer the geographical question

•  apply restrictions to the data collection (e.g. time, money, safety)
and ask learner to ensure their data collection ideas comply with
these

•  group/class discussion as to what methods are suitable.

Experiencing geography in practice will deepen learners
understanding compared to classroom-based learning. To prepare
them for this, learners could experience practice fieldwork first, this
could include:
•  Carry out a pedestrian count at locations around the school.

Experience firsthand how difficult it is to count large volumes of
people moving in different directions and come up with a solution
to this.

There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to
Learners because need to be able to communicate effectively in different forms and settings, through both
Welsh and English. Learners must be able to write and present succinctly and in depth when required to outline
their knowledge and views, make ethical and informed decisions on a range of subjects, write and present
fieldwork investigations and explain the concepts they are learning about. Learners should take delight in
reading on a range of subjects inside and out of their academic subjects such as geography. This will then
prepare them for further study and future careers where these skills will be vital as they get ready to play a full
part in life and work.

listen
then ask the class to write down the answers to questions that you will
ask them once the recording has finished playing

Methods of collecting
primary data

Learners will need to communicate effectively with each other and the public
when collecting their primary data.

Learners need to be aware of the pace, volume and language of speech that
they use when collecting data at fieldwork locations.

Learners could carry out a pilot survey with members of staff or learners from
another class to see how well they are understood. Once all questions have
been asked and answered, the person answering the questions could
provide feedback.

Learners would also be required to communicate effectively with each other
when collecting data. Depending on the type of data collected, it may require
a small group of learners working together e.g. river survey. The team would
need to communicate effectively for data to be collected in the allocated
time.

Learners need to use the appropriate style of writing for the context in which
they are writing. There are opportunities to develop writing skills throughout
Unit 2, but the following are some examples of activities:
•  give learners a partially completed risk assessment and ask them to ‘fill
in the gaps’, ensure that the gaps are random and therefore at some
point during the exercise learners will have to write something in every
column

•  once complete, learners can go through and highlight different types of

language such as instructional, evaluative.

Provide learners with a graph which shows a clear trend. Ask learners to
state what the trend is and then provide three reasons why this trend might
be correct. For each reason, learners should try and add elaboration.

Drawing conclusions
(Drawing reasoned

Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy

GCSE Geography Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 40

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to
Learners because using number effectively in different contexts is a key skill geographers need when learning
across the topic and collecting, presenting and analysing data from fieldwork investigations. Learning to
understand how to interpret data and apply mathematical concepts is a key aspect of both academic study
and the world of work and provides geographers with a unique skillset that they can apply to a range of
different situations.

Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning:

equipment (such as a clinometer and ranging poles) will be beneficial. For
example:
•  place one ranging pole on a chair and the other on the floor with a set
distance between them then use the clinometer to measure the angle
•  once all learners are confident in using the equipment in the classroom,
then they could measure angles of elevation around the school grounds.

Learners are expected to process the data that they have collected and to
carry out relevant statistical analysis upon it. Basic data processing
including percentages, calculating distances, and mean, median and mode
should be able to be applied to most investigations.

For some fieldwork activities there are more specialist statistical techniques
that learners might wish to explore (although these are not required). For
example:

Learners will collect quantitative data about the real world.

Learners can carry out a pilot or small-scale study within the school grounds
to learn how shape, space and position influences the geographical
processes and features they might be investigating. For example, learners
could take some temperature and windspeed readings at various points
around the school grounds and follow up with a class discussion as to how
shape, space and position affect the microclimates around the school.

Learners may be required to measure angles (topic dependent).

If measuring angles is likely to form part of the fieldwork enquiry (e.g. beach
or river profiles), the giving learners the chance to become familiar with the
equipment (such as a clinometer and ranging poles) will be beneficial. For
example:
•  place one ranging pole on a chair and the other on the floor with a set
distance between them then use the clinometer to measure the angle
•  once all learners are confident in using the equipment in the classroom,
then they could measure angles of elevation around the school grounds

•  when back in the classroom learners can draw out the profile of the

measurements they have taken so that they have a visual representation
of what they have measured.

Cross-curricular Skills - Digital Competence

GCSE Geography Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 45

There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are
important to Learners because in an increasingly digital world, using digital technologies creatively to
communicate, find and analyse information provides geographers with vital skills that set them up for future
academic studies and careers. As learners become more digitally competent and aware it is vital that they
channel this knowledge into using digital technologies safely and with care and apply it to a range of
geographical contexts. Combining opportunities for literacy, numeracy and digital competence in Geography
will allow learners to undertake research, creatively present and analyse results and evaluate critically what
they find as well as express emotions through different media, ensuring they are set up to tackle future
challenges and are ready to learn throughout their lives.

Below are some examples of how Digital Competence can be embedded into teaching and learning:

As learners can collaborate when collecting their data, the sharing
of data is important.

Once the full enquiry is completed, learners might also want to
share their findings with relevant sections of the community to
inform their thinking e.g. a study investigating the flow of people
through a town centre could be shared with the local council or
the management company.

2.3.3

Referencing secondary data

Learners will most likely collaborate to collect their primary data.
Therefore, working as a team is the most effective way to ensure
accurate data is collected in the allocated time. Ensure learners
practice their role in data collection e.g. if doing a river survey,
ensure each group knows who will be holding the tape measure,
who will be measuring speed of flow, etc. Practice using the
equipment in the classroom or on school grounds first so that it is
familiar to learners. Discuss with learners afterwards the
importance of collaboration and supporting each other when
collecting data.

If permission needs to be gained to access a location to collect
primary data, involve the learners in the process of contacting the
relevant organisation to gain permission for access.

There are many opportunities to include Creativity and Innovation in GCSE Geography. These opportunities
are important to Learners because geography should encourage them to connect and apply their knowledge
and skills to create ideas and projects and to think creatively to make decisions and solve problems. When
faced with problems to solve and decisions to make on sustainable issues, learners will be able to think about
and then make choices that reflect creative ideas and innovative solutions to issues from across the
geographical world and beyond.

There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE Geography. These
opportunities are important to Learners because the ability to critically assess resources and arrive at
informed solutions to a range of problems is a vital skill learners should develop throughout their study.
Learners should aim to question the validity and accuracy of resources and data across the Units in the
specification and apply this when making decisions and solving problems related to the key issues they will
encounter. Learners should be encouraged to enjoy questioning and solving problems and be given a range
of opportunities to do so within the subject of geography.

There are many opportunities for learners to think critically
when interpreting both primary and secondary data. For
example, when considering secondary data, they can
consider if the resource is biased.

To develop these skills, give learners different opinions
about a local controversial planning issue. Learners to
decide as to why each person had that opinion and whether
the resource is reliable.

Learners need to be confident in looking at data to draw
conclusions. Learners should benefit from regular practice
of using and interpreting data.

Encourage learners to evaluate each stage of the enquiry
model and consider what went well and what could have
been improve upon. The type of questions that could be
considered are:
•
•  Did I use the correct units of measure?
•

Is the data I have collected accurate?

Is my method reliable?

GCSE Geography Unit 2 Guidance for Teaching 51

•  Was there any other data that I could have collected that

would have made my data more reliable?
Is my data affected by bias?

•
•  Did I unintentionally create bias in the wording of my

questionnaires?

•  What questions do my findings point me into asking

next?

There are many opportunities to include Planning and Organisation in GCSE Geography. These opportunities
are important to Learners because when faced with investigations to conduct or decisions to make, learners
must be able to plan their time, organise their work and meet deadlines effectively. This is a key skill for
learners both in geography when faced with decision making exercises, fieldwork investigations and revision
for example, and in the wider world as a part of their future life and work.

submissions are presented in order of the six stages, and all
are complete, therefore time management is key. Support to
learners could include:
•  giving learners set times to complete each stage of the
enquiry to ensure that all are completed in the seven
hours' time limit

•  when teaching section 2.1.1 ensure learners understand
the six-stage process and what is required at each
stage.

•  data collection strategies
•  data processing strategies
•  data presentation strategies.

Learners should know the impact that different sample sizes
can have on the outcomes of an enquiry and the importance
of balancing time with gaining a representative and inclusive
sample. Learners can experience this by:
•  Put all learners standing in a line and ask one learner to

select ten people through opportunistic, random,
stratified and systematic sampling. The learners could
also be lined up in age/height to add greater
understanding to stratified sampling. This activity could
also be used to illustrate the impact of different sample
sizes on outcomes.

•  Learners to give the advantages and disadvantages of

the four methods of sampling.

Learners are required to submit their work digitally and
therefore this needs to be included into their planning.
