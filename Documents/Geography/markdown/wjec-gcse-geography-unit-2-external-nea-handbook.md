# <span id="page-3-0"></span>About this handbook: Information for Teachers

This handbook contains the assessment materials for Unit 2: Developing Fieldwork Skills**.**

Within this handbook, you will find:

- information for teachers on how to manage arrangements for assessment
- **information for candidates** which includes:
  - details of the assignment
  - a detailed breakdown of each task
  - information about things that they must and must not do when they are completing the assessment

**You must provide each candidate with a copy of the complete candidate assessment pack.**

# <span id="page-3-1"></span>Managing the assessment

This is a WJEC marked (external) non-examination assessment. The following arrangements must be followed when managing the assessment.

# **Task setting**

This assignment has been produced by WJEC and cannot be changed.

# **Time**

Candidates must be allowed **seven hours** to complete this assessment (this does not include the time it takes to undertake the fieldwork). Candidates should spend approximately:

- 1 hour completing task 1
- 1 hour 30 minutes completing task 2
- 1 hour 30 minutes completing task 3
- 45 minutes completing task 4
- 1 hour completing task 5
- 1 hour 15 minutes completing task 6.

The time suggested for each task takes account of the contribution of the task to the overall assessment requirements. There can be no changes to the total time available for this assessment. Centres can, however, amend the suggested time available for each task.

# **Resources**

Candidates must always have access to this handbook and the resources within it during the completion of the NEA.

{4}------------------------------------------------

# **Collaboration**

The report needs to be undertaken without collaboration. However, candidates can collaborate with other candidates as part of the planning and for data collection purposes (Tasks 1 and 2).

# **Supervision**

All tasks in this unit are taken under indirect supervision.

| Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Indirect | Candidates do not need to be directly supervised at all times The centre must ensure that: <ul><li>all candidates participate in the assessment</li><li>there is sufficient supervision to ensure that work can be authenticated</li><li>the work an individual candidate submits for assessment is his/her own.</li></ul> |
|  | Candidates' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be stored securely between timetabled sessions. |

Centres must have in place systems to ensure candidates cannot access evidence they have been developing outside of supervised activities.

### **Authentication**

Supervision must be in place to ensure the authenticity of evidence produced for summative assessment.

You should not provide input or guidance to candidates during the assessment time. This includes providing formative feedback on the evidence being produced. You can provide guidance on the requirements of the task and remind candidates of the mark bands and how they can be interpreted.

Candidates can review and redraft evidence independently within the time controls for the assessment.

Candidates must sign the declaration to confirm that all evidence submitted for moderation is their own work and that any sources used have been acknowledged.

Assessors must sign the declaration to confirm that evidence submitted for moderation was completed under the conditions set out in this assessment.

# **Candidate evidence**

The acceptable formats for evidence of each of the tasks is summarised in the task tables. Any modified assessment must enable the candidate to generate the evidence required in this table.

{5}------------------------------------------------

# **Task marking**

WJEC will mark all evidence produced by candidates.

Centres **must** ensure that a **candidate cover sheet** is completed for every candidate and digitally attached to the front of the candidate's work.

Centres **must** also ensure that candidates complete a **candidate declaration form**, which must also be digitally attached to the candidate's work alongside the candidate cover sheet.

Centres must complete a **fieldwork statement**, confirming that each learner has been provided with an opportunity to undertake their Unit 2 Geographical Fieldwork on one day and in one named location. These forms should be sent in digitally when all candidate work is being submitted in the February of the year of the final award.

These three documents, along with this NEA handbook, will be stored in the Fieldwork Guidance section of the WJEC GCSE Geography website.

# **Notes on the completion of the Candidate Cover Sheet and Candidate Declaration Form**

- The forms must be completed and securely attached to the Candidate's work, which is then uploaded via Surpass.
- The forms can be completed electronically or manually. Electronic signatures will be accepted.

# **Further information**

You should refer the JCQ Instructions for conducting non-examination assessment for further information on managing assessment within our GCSE Qualifications.

{6}------------------------------------------------

# <span id="page-6-0"></span>Assessment details

For this assessment learners are required to undertake a fieldwork enquiry following the sixstage enquiry process.

Tasks are not intended to change for the lifetime of the qualification. The two selected topics will change annually; the choice of topics up to 2030 is outlined in the table below. Further topics will be released at a later date; Centres can select **one** of the two topics. Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the year learners undertake the assignment.

This assessment contributes to 25% of the overall qualification grade and will take 7 hours for candidates to complete the tasks (this does not include the time it takes to undertake the fieldwork). The tasks will be marked out of a total of 90 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment, which will be set and marked by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be handwritten and scanned or completed digitally).

WJEC has set two topic areas every year and an annual decision will be made by the centre on **one** topic area that the fieldwork enquiry will be based on.

| Year of submission | Choice of topic (Centres to select one from two) |  |  |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--|
| 2026                  | Geographical flows                                  | Settlement         |  |
| 2027                  | Sustainability                                      | Change over time   |  |
| 2028                  | Mitigating risk                                     | Place and space    |  |
| 2029                  | Inequality                                          | Geographical flows |  |
| 2030                  | Settlement                                          | Sustainability     |  |

*It is important that centres select the topic from the year that they plan to submit the work to WJEC for marking as this may be different to the year that the candidates undertake the assessment*. If candidates choose to re-sit this unit at a later date, they must undertake a fieldwork enquiry for one of topics selected for the academic year they are submitting. The submission deadline for Unit 2 work will be **5 th February** in the year allocated to each topic.

Centres will be expected to carry out fieldwork for the Unit 2 enquiry on one day, outside the classroom and school grounds. This must be authenticated by completing the fieldwork statement, signed by the Head of Centre, outlining the date, location and nature of the fieldwork conducted. Centres are encouraged to undertake further fieldwork during the course, either to support learning or to practice for the Unit 2 enquiry, however this is not required to be declared on the fieldwork statement.

# <span id="page-7-0"></span>Information for Candidates

# **About this pack: information and instructions for candidates**

This information is for candidates completing Unit 2 Developing Fieldwork Skills.

Within this pack, you will find:

- your assignment
- a detailed breakdown of each task, the evidence requirements, and the conditions (controls) under which the task is to be completed
- information which tells you about things that you must and must not do when you are completing the assessment
- the mark scheme which will be used to assess your work

# **You will have seven hours in total to complete this assessment.** You should spend approximately:

- 1 hour completing task 1
- 1 hour 30 minutes completing task 2
- 1 hour 30 minutes completing task 3
- 45 minutes completing task 4
- 1 hour completing task 5
- 1 hour 15 minutes completing task 6.

You can collaborate on Tasks 1 and 2 but must work independently on Tasks 3 to 6. You must not take your work home at any time. It must stay securely stored in your centre between assessment sessions.

Your teacher is allowed to help you to understand the assessment requirements and the tasks, but there are rules about the kind of help and how much they can give you. You should speak to your teacher if you have any questions about what you are and are not allowed to do as you are completing the tasks, as they will know how much help they are allowed to give you.

You and your teacher will be required to sign a declaration that all work presented is your own work and was completed without any assistance beyond any collaboration with other students to develop enquiry questions and safely collect data.

You are advised to check your work carefully to make sure that it is accurate and correct.

{8}------------------------------------------------

# **Assessment:**

Plan and carry out an individual fieldwork enquiry based on the given topic. You will need to produce a written report by completing tasks 1 to 6 which follow the 6-stage enquiry process.

You have **seven** hours to complete your report. Undertaking your fieldwork is **not** included in this time. You will carry out your fieldwork data collection in a group, with your teacher present to oversee the activity. You must not do it on your own.

Your report needs to be undertaken independently. However, you can collaborate with other learners as part of the planning and for data collection purposes (Tasks 1 and 2). Exactly what you can collaborate on is outlined in the Task 1 and 2 instructions on the next 3 pages.

WJEC will set two topic areas in any given year, and an annual decision will be made in your centre on **one** topic area that your fieldwork enquiry will be based on. The topics include:

- change over time
- geographical flows
- inequality
- place and space
- mitigating risk
- settlement
- sustainability.

# You are required to:

- plan your individual fieldwork investigation
- collect your evidence
- process and present your evidence
- analyse and apply your evidence
- draw conclusions
- evaluate each stage of your enquiry.

# **Information for candidates**

The following information has been taken from the [JCQ Information for candidates](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) – non[examination assessments](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) and the [JCQ Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) Use in Assessments:](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/)  [Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/) This tells you about things that you **must** and **must not** do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not understand, you **must** ask your teacher.

# **Information for Candidates**

• When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you are signing to say that the work has been produced in line with controls and guidance set out for this assessment.

# **Instructions for Candidates**

- If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you **must** tell your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
- If you worked as part of a group on Tasks 1 and/or 2, you **must** each write up your own account of what you did. Even if the data you have is the same, you **must** describe in your own words how that data was obtained, and you **must** independently draw your own conclusions from the data.
- Take care of your work and keep it safe. **Do not** leave it lying around where your classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You **must** always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; **do not** share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your password secure.
- **Do not** copy anyone's work and try to pass it off as your own.
- **Do not** use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI tools and chatbots).
- You **must not** write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

# **Plagiarism**

Plagiarism involves taking someone else's words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them off as your own. **It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously.** There are many ways to detect plagiarism:

- Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
- Markers are highly experienced subject specialists they may have read the source you are using or even marked the work you have copied from!
- Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and style of writing or punctuation.

# **Penalties for breaking the regulations**

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, you will be referred to the Malpractice panel who might impose a penalty.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

**Remember – it's your qualification so it needs to be your own work.**

{16}------------------------------------------------

# **Marking scheme**

**0 marks will be awarded if there is no evidence or submitted work is not worthy of credit.**

# **Task 1 (a)**

Plan your enquiry question/s.

You should:

- link your question/s to a given topic
