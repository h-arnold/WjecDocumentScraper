# <span id="page-3-0"></span>Aims of the Delivery Guide

The aim of the Delivery Guide is to give an overview of the qualification and to help teachers understand how we assess the GCSE. It will offer an introduction to the specification, an assessment overview, and will support teachers in better understanding how to prepare their learners for the assessment of the different units. More information on each unit can be found in the separate unit guides.

# <span id="page-3-1"></span>Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE Geography consists of 4 units:

|        | Unit title                    | Type of Assessment         | Weighting |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------|
| Unit 1 | Our Physical and Human World  | Written examination        | 30%       |
| Unit 2 | Developing Fieldwork Skills   | Non-examination assessment | 25%       |
| Unit 3 | Our Dynamic and Diverse World | Written examination        | 30%       |
| Unit 4 | Sustainable Solutions         | Non-examination assessment | 15%       |

All units are compulsory.

This is a unitised qualification. It is not tiered.

# <span id="page-3-2"></span>Unit 1

#### **Our Physical and Human World**

Written examination 30% of qualification 90 marks

#### **Overview of unit**

The purpose of this unit is to:

- introduce learners to the key concepts to be explored throughout the course
- explore an equal balance of physical and human geography
- include core topics that will set the context for the course and give the background needed to complete the other three units.

Learners should also develop their mathematical and statistical skills whilst preparing for this Unit. The depth of coverage required of these skills is given in Appendix B on pages 44-45 of the specification.

{4}------------------------------------------------

### <span id="page-4-0"></span>Unit 2

# **Developing Fieldwork Skills**

Non-examination assessment – Fieldwork enquiry Set and marked by WJEC 25% of qualification 90 marks

# **Overview of unit**

The purpose of this unit is to:

- explore both fieldwork and skills
- develop an understanding of the six-stage enquiry model.

Learners should also develop their mathematical and statistical skills whilst preparing for this Unit. The depth of coverage required of these skills is given in Appendix B on pages 44-45 of the specification.

#### **Assessment overview**

For this assessment learners are required to undertake a fieldwork enquiry following the sixstage enquiry process.

The assignment, which includes several tasks, will be issued to centres in an Assessment Pack via the WJEC portal. Tasks are not intended to change for the lifetime of the qualification. The two selected themes will change annually. Centres can select **one** of the two themes. The themes are published in the Assessment Pack for Unit 2 for five years. This will be updated to ensure there are always five years' worth of themes to allow for forward planning. Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the year learners undertake the assignment. However, it is important that centres select the topic from the year that they plan to submit the work for marking as this may be different to the year that the candidates undertake the assessment. If candidates choose to re-sit this unit later, they must undertake a fieldwork enquiry for one of the themes selected for the academic year they are submitting.

This assessment contributes to 25% of the overall qualification grade and will take 7 hours for candidates to complete the tasks (this does not include the time it takes to undertake the fieldwork). The tasks will be marked out of a total of 90 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be set and marked by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be handwritten and scanned or completed digitally).

Centres will be expected to carry out fieldwork for the Unit 2 enquiry on one day, outside the classroom and school grounds. This must be accompanied by a fieldwork statement, signed by the Head of Centre, outlining the date, location and nature of the fieldwork conducted. Centres are encouraged to undertake further fieldwork during the course, either to support learning or to practice for the Unit 2 enquiry, however this is not required to be declared on the fieldwork statement.

{5}------------------------------------------------

### <span id="page-5-0"></span>Unit 3

# **Our dynamic and diverse world**

Written examination: 30% of qualification 90 marks

# **Overview of unit**

The purpose of this unit is to introduce learners to key areas of human and physical geography, exploring the economic, social, cultural and political inter-connectedness between people and places. Learners will investigate:

- inequality, focusing on human rights and diversity
- weather
- climate and climate change
- physical and human global challenges, including a focus on endangered environments (land and ocean).

Learners should also develop their mathematical and statistical skills whilst preparing for this Unit. The depth of coverage required of these skills is given in Appendix B on pages 44-45 of the specification.

# <span id="page-5-1"></span>Unit 4

#### **Sustainable Solutions**

Non-examination assessment – Decision making exercise Set by WJEC, marked by centre and moderated by WJEC 15% of qualification 60 marks

#### **Overview of unit**

The purpose of this unit is to:

- explore current geographical issues and sustainable futures
- introduce the three pillars of sustainability and sustainability goals, based on taking action
- increase problem solving skills.

Learners should also develop their mathematical and statistical skills whilst preparing for this Unit. The depth of coverage required of these skills is given in Appendix B on pages 44-45 of the specification.

#### **Assessment overview**

For this assessment learners are required to undertake a decision-making exercise based on a Resource Pack that contains sustainable issues with several possible options. In Phase 1 of the decision-making candidates will need to research the issue beyond the Resource Pack. Candidates should then produce a maximum of two sides of A4 notes to be used during the assessment. These notes will be submitted alongside the response to the tasks.

The assignment, including the Resource Pack, will be released during the first week of September for assessment in that academic year. The Resource Pack will change annually. Learners should not have access to the Resource Pack until the start of the assessment. Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the year learners undertake the assignment.

# <span id="page-9-0"></span>Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:

- Specification this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to know by the end of their course.
- Assessment Pack this contains the Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) i.e.: sample exam papers and sample NEA tasks, relevant controls for the NEA and, mark schemes

This guide builds upon the information in the specification and assessment pack to help further your understanding of said documents.

# <span id="page-9-1"></span>Understanding the specification amplification

Learners should be made aware of:

- the specification stems
- what the specification stems mean.

# <span id="page-9-2"></span>Specification Stems

When you look through the specification you will notice in the amplification column, we use a variety of wording before the list of content learners need to know; we call this a stem:

![](_page_9_Picture_12.jpeg)

#### Each stem is used for a slightly different reason

| Specification Stem | When it is used |  |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
| Learners should know | When learners are required to use direct recall. |  |
| Learners should be aware of | When learners do not need to understand all aspects of the specified content in detail. Teachers should refer to guidance for teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and breadth to which this content should be taught. |  |
| Learners should understand | When learners are required to demonstrate greater depth than straight identification or recall, for example they can apply knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and can synthesise and evaluate information for a given purpose. |  |
| Learners should be able to | When learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques. |  |

{10}------------------------------------------------

### <span id="page-10-0"></span>Command words

Learners should be made aware of:

- what command words are
- what each command word means
- what each command word assesses.

Command words are the words and phrases used in assessments that tell learners how they should answer the question or complete the task. Command words direct the learner through the question or task and indicate the nature of the response required.

![](_page_10_Picture_7.jpeg)

The following tables are not exhaustive, but will give you a good idea of the command words we typically use:

| Command words for direct recall  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |  |

# <span id="page-15-0"></span>Mark Schemes

Mark schemes and/or assessment criteria test the intended learning outcomes for a component. They describe the knowledge and skills (and possibly attitude) that a candidate is expected to demonstrate in their responses, and they are then used in marking the work.

# **Objective based mark scheme:**

For very short answer questions requiring one correct response.

| Question |  | Answer | AO1 | AO2 | AO3 | Total Mark |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|---------------|
| 1. (a) Find the correct definition for the term 'drainage basin' below. Put a tick (✓) next to the correct definition. |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | Award one mark for: <ul><li>An area of land drained by a river and its tributaries.</li></ul> | 1 |  |  | 1 |

#### **Points based mark scheme**

For short answer questions with a range of possible responses

| (c) |  | Give two reasons why the amount of water in the rivers of a Welsh drainage basin, like the one in Diagram 1, is usually higher in winter than in summer. |  |  |  |  |
|  | Award <ul><li>fewer</li><li>rivers. example:</li><li>fewer</li></ul> | one or two marks for basic reasons, for example: leaves on trees in winter so less interception of rainfall precipitation is higher in winter so more water in the rivers lower temperatures meaning less evaporation from the river surfaces snow is more likely in winter so adds water to the rivers when melting winter storms bring more rainfall so more water in the Award three or four marks for more developed reasons, for leaves on trees in winter so less interception meaning water gets into the rivers more quickly and increases flow/discharge precipitation is higher in winter, so soil becomes saturated more quickly and water enters rivers more quickly lower temperatures give frozen ground, so less water is available to evaporate from the rivers snow is more likely in winter so adds water to rivers when melting, especially if the soil is frozen underneath and infiltration doesn't happen winter storms bring more rainfall that leads to rapid infiltration and saturation of the soil, leading to increased overland flow and subsequently more water in the rivers. | 4 |  |  | 4 |

#### **Levels based mark schemes**

For questions requiring extended responses

**5.** (d) Discuss impacts of international migration on **one** named source country and **one** named host country you have studied.

# **Indicative Content**

Impacts selected should be appropriate to the countries selected. Impacts could include:

- spread and appreciation of other cultures in the host country
- money sent home in remittances to families in the home country
- integration into the host country society creating first and second generation families
- population density and unemployment in the source country is reduced
- host country receives skilled migrants to fill key positions e.g. healthcare professionals, and migrants willing to do low paid, menial jobs so a range of employment is available
- migrants who return home are often more skilled, experienced and talented
- reduces labour shortages in the host country
- segregation/discrimination/racism/alienation of migrants in the host country often occurs
- use of detention centres often keeping migrants in poor, prison like conditions
- highly skilled migrants often end up in low paid jobs not suited to the knowledge and skills they can offer the host country
- high risk of death and disease during the migration journey
- brain drain from the source country
- increased pressure on housing, services and amenities in the host country
- break up of families in the source country if some family members migrate and some stay at home.

Examples could vary but might include Mexicans to the USA, Polish (and other EU) migrants to the UK since 2004, African, Caribbean & Asian Migrants to Europe (historical and present day) or a recent environmental example e.g. Haitians to the USA (Florida) after the 2010 earthquake.
