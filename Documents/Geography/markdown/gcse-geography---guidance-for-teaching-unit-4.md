# <span id="page-6-0"></span>Overview of Unit 4

#### **Sustainable Solutions**

Non-examination assessment – Decision making exercise Set by WJEC, marked by centre and moderated by WJEC 15% of qualification 60 marks

The purpose of this unit is to:

- explore current geographical issues and sustainable futures
- introduce the three pillars of sustainability and sustainability goals, based on taking action
- increase problem solving skills.

## **Assessment overview**

Learners should also develop their mathematical and statistical skills whilst preparing for this Unit. The depth of coverage required of these skills is given in Appendix B on pages 44-45 of the specification.

For this assessment learners are required to undertake a decision-making exercise based on a Resource Pack that contains sustainable issues with several possible options. In Phase 1 of the decision making, candidates will need to research the issue beyond the Resource Pack. Candidates should then produce a maximum of two sides of A4 notes to be used during the assessment. These notes will be submitted alongside the response to the tasks.

The assignment, including the Resource Pack, will be released during the first week of September for assessment in that academic year. The Resource Pack will change annually. Learners should not have access to the Resource Pack until the start of the assessment. Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the year learners undertake the assignment.

This assessment contributes to 15% of the overall qualification grade and will take 5 hours to complete. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions. The assignment will be marked out of a total of 60 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be marked by the centre and moderated by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be handwritten and scanned or completed digitally).

| 4.1.1 Developing ideas of sustainability | Learners should know a definition of sustainability. Learners should understand the importance of seeking sustainable solutions. | Teachers could consider whether the learning in 4.1 is taught at the start of the course in Year 10. Sustainability is referenced throughout all the other units. Starting with 4.1 would support learners to develop the key knowledge of sustainability and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which would support them when learning in all other units. |  |
|  |  | Learners should be able to provide a definition of sustainability. Although there is no single clear definition, learners may start with the definition from the United Nations Brundtland Commission in 1987 that was 'meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.' |  |
|  |  | Sustainability is not just environmentalism, and some definitions will focus on the environmental aspect. Most definitions of sustainability will also bring in the aspects of social equity and economic development. Definitions could be explored through online dictionaries. It may be helpful to consider what people value or find desirable, their vested interest, or their viewpoint from economic/social status. When considering this we could ask what do people want for the future, and do they all value the same things? |  |
|  |  | Exploring the ideas of Kate Raworth and the Doughnut Economics Action Lab may support the learners to consider the changing mindset needed when exploring sustainable solutions. <ul><li>Hello Doughnut!   DEAL</li></ul> |  |

{9}------------------------------------------------

## 4.1.2 The three pillars of sustainability

Learners should understand the three pillars of sustainability:

- economic
- environmental
- social.

Learners should understand that three components need to be considered when making sustainable decisions. Introducing models of sustainability, such as the three pillars (or stool), the overlapping circles or Venn model and the nested circles model will support learners in understanding the interconnection of the three elements.

Learners could be introduced to other language used in discussing sustainability as during any independent research online learners may encounter models that refer to the three P's (people, profit and planet).

Useful starting points could be articles and blogs such as:

- <https://earth.org/what-is-sustainability/>
- [https://sustainabilityadvantage.com/2010/07/20/3-sustainability](https://sustainabilityadvantage.com/2010/07/20/3-sustainability-models)[models](https://sustainabilityadvantage.com/2010/07/20/3-sustainability-models)

## 4.1.3 Sustainability goals

Learners should understand:

- the 17 United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
- how the goals relate to the seven well-being goals in the Well-being of Future Generations Act (Wales) 2015
- how the goals relate to the three pillars of sustainability
- how the goals can contribute to sustainable solutions.

Learners should understand how the United Nations developed these goals for all countries to tackle poverty and other deprivations whilst tackling climate change and working to preserve natural habitats. They should be familiar with the UN diagram of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

• <https://sdgs.un.org/goals>

Learners should understand that the development of the 7 well-being goals in Wales was informed by the 17 UN SDGs. Links can be made between the seven goals in Wales and the UN goals.

- [https://www.gov.wales/wales-and-the-sustainable-development](https://www.gov.wales/wales-and-the-sustainable-development-goals)[goals](https://www.gov.wales/wales-and-the-sustainable-development-goals)
- <https://www.gov.wales/wellbeing-wales-2024> (this link is the most up to date at the time of publication, but is expected to be updated annually)
- [https://www.futuregenerations.wales/about-us/future-generations](https://www.futuregenerations.wales/about-us/future-generations-act)[act](https://www.futuregenerations.wales/about-us/future-generations-act)

{10}------------------------------------------------

Whilst learning is being undertaken in other Units of the course, the SDGs and the Welsh goals could be used as a 'lens' when learning about issues, for example in 1.2.5 or 1.4.4. This could support the learner to apply the goals to issues at a range of scales and in different countries, and to develop a deeper appreciation of how the goals can be applied.

Learners should understand that 17 SDGs can be categorised under the headings of the three pillars of sustainability. Models and diagrams could be used to support learners in making those connections.

![](_page_10_Figure_3.jpeg)

<https://sustainability-success.com/three-pillars-of-sustainability>

Sustainable solutions should be considered through the 17 UN SDGs and learners should understand that more than one of the SDGs may be applied to, or considered, when deciding about an issue or challenge. When studying issues in all units of the course a starting point may to be to discuss which of the goals most apply to that issue or challenge. This could be an activity, for example a diamond rank, that supports learners in understanding the interconnected nature of the SDGs and the Welsh goals.

| 4.2.1 The skills of decision making • • • • • • | Learners should be able to use the following skills when undertaking decision making: cartographic, graphical, numerical and statistical skills communication skills evaluative skills interpretative skills problem-solving skills referencing skills. | Cartographic, graphical, numerical and statistical skills can be applied to issues and challenges addressed in other units e.g. 1.2.5 coastal change, 1.3.3 managing migration, 1.4.1 urbanisation, with a focus on sustainable solutions. Learners should have opportunities throughout the course to use a range of skills applying them to a variety of different resources and information. Opportunities will arise, during the study of issues and challenges, for learners to debate the social, economic and environmental implications and how these could be mitigated through sustainable solutions. Opportunities to debate and discuss issues and challenges will support learners to develop increasingly sophisticated arguments and improve communication of issues, challenges and possible solutions. Using case studies, at a range of scales, learners could be supported to evaluate and interpret a range of data on issues and challenges, e.g. analysis of changes in development indicators or reducing the development gap whilst learning in 3.1.4, or interpreting data on oceanic pollutants whilst learning in 3.5.2 managing the threats to our oceans. Problem-solving skills can be developed throughout the course through a variety of case studies e.g. 3.5.2 managing threats to our oceans or 3.3.1 worldwide hazards caused by extreme low pressure. Learners problem-solving skills could be developed through collaborative investigations of issues, where scaffolds could be used to support their thinking around issues and challenges. |

{12}------------------------------------------------

|  |  | Learners could develop referencing skills throughout the course, especially in 2.3.3 when referencing secondary data sources. These skills should build upon learning in the Digital Competence Framework and learners should develop the skills to cite and reference sources using appropriate methods. |

| 4.2.2 Using evidence to identify issues | Learners should be able to use and research evidence to identify geographical issues by: <ul><li>identifying key information within sources and supporting materials</li><li>researching appropriate information</li><li>synthesising the information to clearly identify the issue</li><li>referencing the researched information</li><li>recognising misleading or invalid information, including bias and vested interest.</li></ul> | Learners could develop skills in using evidence throughout the course in all units. These skills will build upon learning in the Numeracy Framework and Digital Competence Framework. Opportunities could be developed in all other units, for example: <ul><li>1.4.4 Urbanisation in contrasting global cities - learners could explore a range of data and information to understand the impacts of urbanisation in two contrasting global cities.</li><li>1.3.2 Managing migration - learners could explore a range of data and information from the media and debate whether this is misleading and how this influences public perceptions.</li></ul> |
| 4.2.3 Potential benefits of proposed solutions | Learners should be able to consider the potential benefits of proposed options for: <ul><li>society (including human rights and diversity)</li><li>the economy</li><li>the environment.</li></ul> | Learners could be supported when studying other units to consider all three components of sustainability in each issue or challenge. Learners could be supported with grids when studying a new issue and over time become increasingly independent in their analysis of the issue or challenge. For example: <ul><li>3.5.2 Managing threats to our oceans - learners could explore several strategies at a range of scales and with support identify the benefits for the three components of sustainability within each strategy.</li></ul> |

| 4.2.4 Potential negative impacts of proposed solutions | Learners should be able to consider the potential negative impacts of proposed options for: <ul><li>society (including human rights and diversity)</li><li>the economy</li><li>the environment.</li></ul> | Learners could be supported when studying other units to consider all three components of sustainability in each issue or challenge. Learners could be supported with grids when studying a new issue and over time become increasingly independent in their analysis of the issue or challenge. For example: <ul><li>3.1.4 Reducing the development gap - learners could explore several strategies that governments and agencies are using to reduce the development gap and identify the potential negative impacts for the three components of sustainability within each strategy.</li></ul> |

| 4.2.5 Sustainability impact assessment | Learners should be able to: <ul><li>undertake a sustainability impact assessment of proposed options</li><li>explain why some options or ideas may have been rejected</li><li>reach a decision based on the sustainability impact assessment of the best potential option.</li></ul> | Learners could be supported to explore different versions of sustainability impact assessments that can be found online. The learners, with support, could consider the most appropriate questions to consider in creating a basic sustainability impact assessment (SIA). When options have been considered the learners could then create a report to explain why some options are less sustainable than others. This approach could also support learning in other units. One possible online assessment tool that could be used is: <ul><li>https://sdgimpactassessmenttool.org/en-gb</li><li>Example: 3.3.1 Worldwide hazards caused by extreme low pressure - learners could use a SIA approach when studying the sustainability of responses to a specific global extreme low pressure event.</li></ul> |

## <span id="page-14-0"></span>Learning Experiences

Learners should be encouraged to consider the following learning experiences and skills to further develop their understanding, appreciation and awareness of the subject content. Information in the table below provides opportunities for teachers to integrate the learning experiences into delivery.

The learning experiences suggested in the table below are not to be considered as discrete activities and nor are they solely for consideration in Unit 4. Learners could focus on an issue in Unit 1 or Unit 3, in preparation for using the resource booklet, and have opportunities to consider different viewpoints on an issue, explore the study area digitally, or in person, and work collaboratively with others on potential solutions.

| Learning Experience                                                                                                                                          | Exemplification of Learning Experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| make appropriate use of digital technology when completing the qualification, for example through accessing satellite images and digital maps | 4.2.1 Learners could use online mapping tools, including OS maps, satellite images and 3D views, to explore study areas. Learners could use these digital tools to develop their locational understanding of the place where there is an issue or challenge. |
| develop empathy, tolerance, compassion and curiosity, through studying different geographical contexts | 4.1.2, 4.1.3, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, 4.2.4, 4.2.5 Learners will need to consider the views and opinions of other people from a range of diverse backgrounds and with different views and perspective. Learners could also consider their own values and attitudes when exploring issues and potential solutions. Learners should be able to explore issues with a greater understanding and tolerance of the views of others. Learners could be encouraged to critically challenge common beliefs and views on a range of issues. |
| participate in educational visits (other than fieldwork) in person or digitally | 4.2.1 Learners could be provided with learning experiences in environments outside of the classroom, or via online platforms, that support them in developing a greater understanding of an issue, challenge or potential solution. E.g. Learners could visit a local site that is being developed in a sustainable way or virtually 'meet' a person or organisation that is promoting a sustainable way of working. |
| engage in collaborative working | 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, 4.2.4, 4.2.5 Learners could work collaboratively throughout the study for unit 4. Learners may wish to work together in collating information. They could be encouraged to debate the validity of information and the range of views in relation to the issue or challenge. Learners may benefit from working collaboratively on issues and challenges encountered during the course (e.g. 1.3.3 Managing migration) to discuss and debate the different approaches taken to manage these in a sustainable way. |

# Opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales

#### **Curriculum for Wales Strands**

#### **Cross-cutting Themes**

**There are many opportunities to include Local, National and International Contexts in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because geography encourages them to think about their sense of cynefin and their sense of belonging to the UK and the wider world. These can be explored through real life case studies in Wales, the UK and from around the world across the different themes in the specification and can help to ensure that learners are knowledgeable about their culture, community, society and the world, now and in the past.**

**Below are some examples of how Local, National and International Contexts can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

<span id="page-15-0"></span>Local, National & International Contexts

| 4.2.2 | Using evidence to identify issues | The context of the issue or challenge could be exemplified at a range of scales and learners could be provided with a range of evidence, e.g. maps, text, newspaper reports, images that would support their learning. The SDGs and the Welsh goals can be applied to the issue and challenge at any scale, even if the issue is at an international scale the Welsh goals could be used as a 'lens' applied to the country in question to focus the learner's exploration of the issue. For example: |
|  |  | A proposal to build new houses in the local area – using plans, traffic data, images and reports from the local newspaper. |
|                            |                                      | Or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|  |  | Proposed solutions to tackle plastic pollution in the Pacific Ocean, using images, data and proposals from several different countries. |

| Sustainability | could and should in depth throughout the unit. | There are many opportunities to include Sustainability in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because considering the sustainability of their actions in relation to global issues such as climate change, deforestation, over-abstraction of resources and population growth have never been more important than they are now. Learners should be encouraged to think how their actions now may relate to the sustainability of life on earth for future generations, something that be considered across all the different themes in the specification. This gives them the chance to become ethical and informed citizens of Wales and the world, showing their commitment to the sustainability of the planet. Unit 4 has a focus on making decisions that have sustainable solutions, and this topic will be covered |  |

{17}------------------------------------------------

| There are many opportunities to include Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because through the study of people and places in geography, a range of different views and ideologies will be encountered, increasing knowledge of these views and encouraging learners to have fair and unbiased opinions based on what they learn. This will help them develop secure values, establish their spiritual and ethical beliefs and an appreciation of other people's values and views, both locally, nationally and around the world. Below are some examples of how RSE can be embedded into teaching and learning: |  |  |  |

Relationships and Sexuality Education

| identify issues | Whilst researching and synthesising information learners should consider the view and perspectives of other people. They should develop empathy and understanding on why people may hold a different view to themselves. They should understand the idea of values and that other people may value economic or social development more than environmental development or vice versa. This will support learners in their understanding of bias and vested interest. |  |

**There are many opportunities to include Human Rights Education and Diversity in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because it is vital to consider them when studying key current topics such as migration, settlement growth, and equality of access to resources. Past, present and future issues linked to human rights and diversity must be considered when considering people, places and their interactions between them. Through this, learners can be educated to tackle ignorance and misinformation around this subject and to respect the needs and rights of others, as a member of a diverse society.**

**There are many opportunities to include Career and Work-Related Experiences (CWRE) in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because many will go on to future careers in a world increasingly dominated by key geographical issues such as climate change and management of resources. Learners must be equipped with the knowledge and skills to understand these issues and to fire their interest in taking on a career that will make a positive difference to a sustainable future. Signposting opportunities like this is the first step to producing enterprising, creative contributors who are ready to play a full part in life and work.**

**Below are some examples of how CWRE can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

## **Cross-curricular Skills – Literacy**

**There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because need to be able to communicate effectively in different forms and settings, through both Welsh and English. Learners must be able to write and present succinctly and in depth when required to outline their knowledge and views, make ethical and informed decisions on a range of subjects, write and present fieldwork investigations and explain the concepts they are learning about. Learners should take delight in reading on a range of subjects inside and out of their academic subjects such as geography. This will then prepare them for further study and future careers where these skills will be vital as they get ready to play a full part in life and work.**

**Below are some examples of how Literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

|  | Specification Reference | Amplification | Example |
|-----------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  | 4.2.1 | The skills of decision making | Learners should have the opportunity to listen to a range of values, views and points of view when considering complex issues surrounding sustainability especially if interviewing people or listening |
| Listening | 4.2.2 | Using evidence to identify issues | to speakers e.g. as outlined in the earlier learning experiences section on possible educational visits. Other examples include: <ul><li>1.3.3 – Managing migration, when exploring the role of the media in influencing public perceptions on migration.</li><li>3.5.1 – Managing climate change, learners could respond to a range of sources that reflect different views on climate change.</li></ul> |

| Reading | 4.2.2 | Using evidence to identify issues | Learners should have the opportunity to independently research a wide range of sources to develop an understanding of complex issues and challenges. They should also be encouraged to explore in detail how information is interpreted and distinguish between facts/evidence and bias and arguments within source materials. This will support them as they explore different interpretations of issues to use written sources to support their opinions. These skills can be explored throughout the course: <ul><li>1.3.3 – Managing migration, when exploring the role of the media in influencing public perceptions on migration.</li><li>1.1.6 – How rivers and their landforms impact on physical and human environments, when exploring sustainability issues of people managing rivers.</li></ul> |
|  | Specification Reference | Amplification | Example |
| Speaking | 4.2.1 | The skills of decision making | Learners can be supported to develop speaking skills through structured debate and argument on issues and challenges. Learners should be encouraged and supported to share thoughts, feelings and opinions on increasingly challenging and contentious issues. Through this, learners will develop the skills to organise talk effectively to critically evaluate and respond to what they read and see in sources. For example: <ul><li>1.3.3 – Managing migration, learners could debate public perceptions on migration and the different approaches to managing migration.</li></ul> |
