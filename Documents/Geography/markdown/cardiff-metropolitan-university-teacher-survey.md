Cardiff Metropolitan University & Canterbury Christ Church University Research Survey

Dear Teacher,

As  you  may  know,  we're  working  with  Canterbury  Christ  Church  University  on  a  research  project  to
explore  teacher-teacher  dialogue  around  Curriculum  for  Wales.  As a  first  stage  of  the  project,  we're
releasing a survey aimed at secondary school teachers across Wales. We would really appreciate you,
as  a  secondary  school  teacher  in  Wales,  taking  the  time  to  complete  this  survey.  It  should  take  15
minutes. We also ask you to have a conversation with your teaching colleagues about the survey so that
they have a reminder to  complete  it. We're hoping to understand the conversations you have before
launching some research interventions later in the project. We plan to donate money to some Welsh
charities in line with responses to the survey. Go to our website to find out more about our project and
sign up for updates. https://nicer.org.uk/cultivating-dialogue
