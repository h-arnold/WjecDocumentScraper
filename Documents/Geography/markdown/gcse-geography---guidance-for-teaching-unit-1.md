#### **Our Physical and Human World**

Written examination 30% of qualification 90 marks

The purpose of this unit is to:

- introduce learners to the key concepts to be explored throughout the course
- explore an equal balance of physical and human geography
- include core topics that will set the context for the course and give the background needed to complete the other three units.

Learners should also develop their mathematical and statistical skills whilst preparing for this Unit. The depth of coverage required of these skills is given in Appendix B on pages 44-45 of the specification.

| In this unit, learners will develop knowledge, skills and understanding in: |                                                                      |  |

#### 1.1.2 The drainage basin system

Learners should know:

- the characteristics of an open system
- what is meant by the term drainage basin.

Learners should understand:

- the inputs, transfers, stores and outputs that operate within a drainage basin
- how water moves through the drainage basin
- how the amount of water in a drainage basin varies seasonally.

An open system, such as a drainage basin, has inputs and outputs, meaning the amount of 'water' within the system can change over time and between places.

- Inputs: Precipitation.
- Outputs: Evaporation, Transpiration and Channel Flow.
- Flows: Overland flow, Infiltration, Percolation, Throughflow and Groundwater Flow.
- Stores: Vegetation, Surface, Soil and Rocks.

An open system, such as a drainage basin, will have variation in mass balance. For example:

- if the inputs are greater than the outputs, there will be a surplus of 'water' in the system
- if the inputs are less than the outputs, there will be a deficit of 'water' in the system.

Discharge is the amount of water flowing in a river channel at a given time. It is measured in cumecs (m<sup>3</sup> /s).

There is seasonal variation in an open system:

- Winter: greater precipitation levels; colder temperatures, allowing for reduced evaporation and reduced interception/transpiration due to deciduous vegetation losing their leaves. This can result in an increase in river discharge and a possible flood.
- Summer: reduced precipitation levels; warmer temperatures allowing for increased evaporation and increased interception and transpiration. This can result in a reduced river discharge and a possible drought.

Seasonal variation can be illustrated on a hydrograph/river regime: [rvyTOhwOC3pFzHT3hn5Ssg.jpg \(500×276\) \(quizlet.com\)](https://o.quizlet.com/rvyTOhwOC3pFzHT3hn5Ssg.jpg)

Erosion occurs within the river channel and there are four types:

- Hydraulic Action is when air is forced into cracks in the banks/bed of the river, forcing them to expand.
- Abrasion / corrasion is when rocks carried in the flow of the river smash into the banks/bed of the river.
- Solution / corrosion is where chemicals in the river dissolve minerals in the bank/bed of the river.
- Attrition is when rocks crash together as they move along in the river.

Vertical erosion results in the deepening of the channel. Lateral erosion results in the widening of the channel.

Transportation occurs to move sediment along the river. There are four types:

- Solution is when dissolved minerals are carried in the flow of the water.
- Suspension is when fine particles are float in the river flow.
- Saltation is when rocks bounce along the riverbed.
- Traction is when boulders roll over smaller rocks on the riverbed.

River Transportation Processes Video: [River transport processes](https://timeforgeography.co.uk/videos-list/rivers/river-transport-processes/)  [\(timeforgeography.co.uk\)](https://timeforgeography.co.uk/videos-list/rivers/river-transport-processes/)

Deposition: When the flow of the water slows it has less energy to carry sediment, so it is deposited. This can be on the inside bend of a meander or the banks and floodplain of a river when it floods.

This is known as the long profile. <ul><li>The upper course of the river, near the source: Here the land is steep, and rivers often have more obstacles (larger rocks, boulders) in the channel, creating greater friction between the water and bed & banks. This reduces the velocity of the river. Vertical erosion levels are high, and the cross profile will be narrow and shallow with low discharge levels. Velocity may sometimes be higher in the upper course however e.g. when the gradient of the valley is steepest, after heavy rain or when few obstacles are present in the channel.</li><li>The middle course of the river: Here the land isn't quite so steep, and the river has fewer obstacles in the channel, increasing velocity and giving higher levels of lateral erosion. Sediment will continue to be transported by the channel. The cross profile will be wider and deeper with increased discharge levels because of tributaries adding to the main channel flow, also increasing the velocity.</li><li>The lower course of the river, near the mouth: Here the gradient has shallowed out and the river velocity will be highest, as friction between the water and bed & banks has decreased. Deposition will be the dominant process operating. The cross profile will be wider and deeper again, because of tributaries adding to the main channel flow.</li></ul> |

{14}------------------------------------------------

• It must be noted however that a variety of factors can affect the velocity of the river from source to mouth and the idea of velocity increasing from source to mouth is not always true. Factors such as sudden changes in gradient, flooding, obstructions in the channel (e.g. reservoirs and weirs slowing the velocity, waterfalls and rapids speeding it up) and changes in material in the channel (e.g. build-up of vegetation or debris in the channel, changes in the size and nature of material carried by the river) all may cause local variations to velocity and therefore the characteristics of a certain river at certain points along its course.

In the lower course, the fastest flow of water will be in the centre of the channel as there will be reduced friction here. Friction with the riverbed and banks will slow the velocity of the river down. This can be illustrated using isovels: <a href="Mailto:CrossSection Velocity Uniform.JPG">CrossSection Velocity Uniform.JPG</a> (366×247) (coolgeography.co.uk).

Rates of erosion within a drainage basin will vary depending on a range of natural factors:

- Geology: Impermeable rock such as granite is more resistant and will have reduced rates of erosion whereas permeable rock such as sandstone is less resistant and will have increased rates of erosion.
- Gradient: Steeper gradients result in faster flow and increased energy contributing to increased erosion whereas gentler gradients result in slower flow and decreased erosion

#### Suggested learning activities:

#### 1.1.5 How drainage basin landforms are created

#### Learners should understand:

- the development of erosional landforms in upper and middle courses of rivers, including:
  - gorges
  - plunge pools
  - waterfalls.
- the development of depositional landforms, in middle and lower courses of rivers, including:
  - floodplains
  - meanders
  - oxbow lakes.
- an example of a local or Welsh river valley to identify its major landforms of erosion and deposition.

Waterfall formation diagram: [5f45bad6622e86d6cac7723aff208d58.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5f/45/ba/5f45bad6622e86d6cac7723aff208d58.jpg)  [\(1504×1972\) \(pinimg.com\)](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5f/45/ba/5f45bad6622e86d6cac7723aff208d58.jpg)

Waterfalls form where hard, impermeable rocks such as granite, sit on top of soft, permeable rocks such as sandstone. The sandstone is more rapidly eroded by processes such as hydraulic action and abrasion, undercutting the hard, impermeable rock to create an overhang.

Over time the overhang increases in size, but due to its increased weight being unsupported, it topples into the plunge pool below, because of gravitational collapse.

Here, the broken pieces of overhang are used to widen and deepen the plunge pool due to abrasion. The material also becomes smaller and more rounded due to attrition, and the undercutting/erosion continues.

Over time the waterfall retreats upstream, leaving behind a steep sided gorge.

An example of a Welsh waterfall would be Pistyll Rhaeadr, in the upper Tanat Valley, Mid-Wales.

Formation of a waterfall video: [Formation of a waterfall and gorge](https://timeforgeography.co.uk/videos-list/rivers/formation-waterfall-gorge/)  [\(timeforgeography.co.uk\)](https://timeforgeography.co.uk/videos-list/rivers/formation-waterfall-gorge/)

Meanders are a bend in the river that begin to occur in the middle course of the river but are often fully established in the lower course of the river, on the flat floodplain.

Cross section through a meander diagram: [meander-cross-section.png](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=1920/uploads/2022/06/meander-cross-section.png)  [\(1100×622\) \(savemyexams.com\).](https://cdn.savemyexams.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,width=1920/uploads/2022/06/meander-cross-section.png)

On the outside bend of a meander, the river is always flowing fastest and so there is increased energy.

{17}------------------------------------------------

This results in erosion, particularly hydraulic action, as the river crashes into the riverbanks and bed, making the channel deeper and the sides steeper. This creates a river cliff.

On the inside bend of a meander, the river is always flowing slowly as there is increased friction with the riverbed and banks, reducing the river's energy. This results in increased deposition creating a slip-off slope.

Due to the processes operating on the inside and outside of the bends, the position of the meander will change over time. This is referred to as meander migration.

Fast flowing water on the outside of the bend causes the neck of the meander to become increasingly narrower. In times of flood, the river's energy levels will be highest. At this point the river will completely cut through the meander neck.

Deposition occurs on the inside of the bend, due to slower flow and increased friction with the riverbed. This deposition clogs the channel, cutting off and isolating the meander loop, creating an oxbow lake. Over time the water in the oxbow lake will drain away, leaving behind a meander scar.

Floodplains Video: [Floodplains \(timeforgeography.co.uk\)](https://timeforgeography.co.uk/videos-list/rivers/floodplains/)

Examples of Welsh river valleys could include the Taff, Conwy, Ystwyth or Severn/Hafren.

Suggested learning activities:

- annotated sketch to show waterfall formation
- use data to plot and label a cross section through a meander

# migration sketch 1.1.6 Interrelationships between rivers and people Learners should understand: • how people use rivers and their landforms in sustainable and non-sustainable ways: • floodplains for farming • housebuilding on a floodplain • rivers for Hydro-electric power (HEP) • waterfalls for tourism. • the impact of rivers and their landforms on people, including: • flooding and its associated impacts • erosion, transportation and deposition in river environments • hard and soft river engineering/management. Learners should know how these factors have influenced change along a stretch of a local or Welsh river. side of the channel. quality of the yields. previously deforested.

- annotated cross section through a meander to explain meander
- annotated sketch to show oxbow lake formation
- OS map landform identification
- satellite image landform identification
- fieldwork: visit a local waterfall and complete an annotated field
- fieldwork: visit a local meander and take width and depth readings at regular intervals to investigate changes across the channel
- use a GIS package, such as Digimap for schools, ESRI Survey 123 or Arc GIS, to investigate a local Welsh river valley and identify features/landforms along its course.

Floodplains are formed in the lower course of a river, when a river bursts its banks, depositing sediment in layers on the flat land either

The material deposited is known as silt/alluvium and it is highly fertile and so floodplains are often favoured by farmers to increase the

Sustainable ways people use rivers and their landforms:

- Arable farming: growing crops on the floodplain and in the surrounding drainage basin. This can increase interception, root absorption and transpiration thus reducing the flood risk.
- HEP: using Welsh rivers as a source of infinite, clean renewable energy such as the Rheidol Hydropower Station, near Aberystwyth.
- Reforestation is the replanting of trees in areas which have been
- Afforestation is the planting of trees in areas where trees were not previously found.

Reforestation and afforestation increase interception, transpiration and root absorption, thus decreasing the flood risk.

{19}------------------------------------------------

They also provide habitat for animals, are a natural carbon sink and are aesthetically pleasing.

Unsustainable ways people use rivers and their landforms :

- Pa storal farming: rearing animals on the floodplain and in the surrounding drainage basin. Animals can compact the soil, reducing infiltration and increasing overland flow, contributing to an increased flood risk.
- Mechanised farming: Machines will compact the soil, reducing infiltration and increasing overland flow. Emissions from machines will enhance the greenhouse effect and cause localised pollution issues .
- Agrichemicals: Pesticides used on the farms can run off into local rivers and cause eutrophication , whilst pesticides and herbicides can poison local ecosystems .
- Housebuilding on a floodplain: Urbanisation uses impermeable materials such as concrete, tarmac and slate, resulting in reduced infiltration, percolation and increased overland flow. Urbanisation also results in increased presence of drains designed to flush water straight back into the river channel, increasing the river discharge. [Flooding: Calls to stop building homes on flood plains](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-51712267)  - [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-51712267) For example , building 33 flats in the flooding zone at Afon Rheidol , as part of the redevelopment of Aberystwyth Town Football Club's Park Avenue ground .
- Tourism: Although there are socio -economic positives attached with tourism, there are many environmental problems linked with congestion, litter, pollution (noise, air and visual) at natural attractions such as waterfalls. For example: Waterfall Country in the Bannau Brycheiniog National Park | [Waterfall Country | Bannau Brycheiniog National Park Authority](https://beacons-npa.gov.uk/environment/waterfall-country/)

{20}------------------------------------------------

 Deforestation: the cutting down and removal of trees. Urbanisation, agriculture and tourism will all contribute to deforestation.
Deforestation reduces soil absorption, interception and transpiration and increases overland flow, hence increasing the flood risk. Animal habitats are also destroyed.

Flooding occurs when a river's discharge increases and exceeds the bankfull capacity, and the river bursts its banks.

Flood risk can be demonstrated using a flood hydrograph: <u>factors-that-affect-a-storm-hydrograph.png</u> (1200×869) (saymedia-content.com)

Lag time is the time difference between peak precipitation and peak discharge.

- A shorter lag time results in a flashier hydrograph and has a greater flood risk, as the river responds quickly to the precipitation event.
- A longer lag time results in a flatter hydrograph and has a reduced flood risk as the river responds slowly to the precipitation event.

There are physical and human causes of flooding:

#### Physical causes:

- Geology: Impermeable rocks such as granite will reduce percolation and result in increased overland flow, reducing the lag time and increasing the flood risk.
- Gradient: Steeper slopes will result in greater amounts of overland flow, reducing the lag time and increasing the flood risk.
- Vegetation amount: Vegetation increases interception, root absorption and transpiration, reducing the amount of water in the drainage basin and so reducing the flood risk.
- Frozen ground: will reduce infiltration and percolation, increasing overland flow, reducing the lag time and increasing the flood risk.

{21}------------------------------------------------

- Saturated ground: water will be unable to infiltrate into the soil and so there will be greater overland flow, reduced lag time and increased flood risk.
- Baked ground: infiltration and percolation will reduce causing increased overland flow. This reduces the lag time and increases the flood risk.

#### Human causes:

- deforestation
- changing land use
- infrequent dredging.

Impacts of flooding can be seen as positive (such as increased alluvium being deposited which can benefit farmers) and negative.

Impacts must be classified as:

- social (affecting people) such as people being forced to evacuate their homes
- economic (financial costs) such as the cost of the cleanup and recovery
- environmental (affecting the environment) such as the damage caused to animal habitats.

Hard river management strategies are expensive strategies, often involving technology and modification of the river channel, using artificial structures. Examples include:

- dams and reservoirs
- levees/embankments
- river straightening.

Soft river management strategies are a more natural approach to river management, working with the natural processes of the river to reduce the flood risk. Examples include:

afforestation/reforestation

{22}------------------------------------------------

- flood warnings
- land use zoning.

| 1.2.1 The processes that operate along a coastline | Learners should know the processes operating along a coastline, including: <ul><li>weathering</li><li>mass movement</li><li>erosion</li><li>transportation</li><li>deposition. Learners should understand the similarities and differences between the processes operating within a drainage basin and the processes that operate along a coastline.</li></ul> | A coastline is a dynamic landscape located where the land meets the sea. Learners need to understand the different processes that operate along a coastline. Weathering occurs on the upper part of a cliff and can be categorised as mechanical, chemical and biological: <ul><li>Mechanical weathering includes freeze thaw weathering and salt crystallisation.</li><li>Chemical weathering includes carbonation.</li><li>Biological weathering includes animal burrowing and root penetration. Weathered material moves to the beach below through processes of mass movement:</li><li>rockfalls – the movement of a mass of rocks off a cliff</li><li>landslide – a collapse of a mass of earth or rock from a cliff. Coastal Weathering and Mass Movement Video: Subaerial erosion processes (timeforgeography.co.uk) Erosion occurs in the wave contact zone at the base of the cliff and there are four types:</li><li>Hydraulic Action is when air is forced into cracks in a cliff by waves, forcing them to expand.</li><li>Abrasion/corrasion is when rocks carried in waves smash into cliffs, knocking bits off.</li><li>Solution/corrosion is where seawater dissolves minerals in the cliff.</li><li>Attrition is when rocks crash together as they move along in the sea.</li></ul> |  |

Coastal Erosion Video: [Marine erosion processes](https://timeforgeography.co.uk/videos-list/coasts/marine-erosion-processes/)  [\(timeforgeography.co.uk\)](https://timeforgeography.co.uk/videos-list/coasts/marine-erosion-processes/)

Transportation occurs to move sediment along the coastline. There are four types:

- Solution is when dissolved minerals are carried in the flow of the water.
- Suspension is when fine particles float along in the current.
- Saltation is when rocks bounce along the seabed.
- Traction is when boulders roll over smaller rocks on the seabed.

Transportation of beach sediment occurs in a zig zag pattern. This is known as Longshore Drift. Waves/swash carry material up the beach in the direction of the fetch. The waves/backwash return material down the beach at right angles/perpendicular to the coastline.

Longshore drift diagram: [transportation-in-coastal-landscapes](https://mammothmemory.net/images/user/base/geography/Coastal%20Landscapes/transportation-in-coastal-landscapes-geography-new-.8f9cacc.v2.jpg)[geography-new-.8f9cacc.v2.jpg \(750×446\) \(mammothmemory.net\).](https://mammothmemory.net/images/user/base/geography/Coastal%20Landscapes/transportation-in-coastal-landscapes-geography-new-.8f9cacc.v2.jpg)

Deposition: Material is deposited along a coastline in low energy conditions.

Suggested Learning Activities:

- annotated sketches to describe and explain the processes that operate within a drainage basin
- photograph analysis to identify coastal process
- coastal fieldwork identifying locations along a local stretch of coastline where these processes are active
- coastal fieldwork sediment analysis along a stretch of coastline.

#### 1.2.2 Constructive and destructive waves

#### Learners should understand:

- wave formation
- the characteristics of constructive and destructive waves
- the role of the fetch in influencing wave characteristics
- how seasonal changes in wave energy leads to differing beach profiles.

#### Constructive waves [Constructive-Wave-1024x764.png \(1024×764\)](https://www.alevelgeography.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Constructive-Wave-1024x764.png) [\(alevelgeography.com\):](https://www.alevelgeography.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Constructive-Wave-1024x764.png)

- a long wavelength
- a low frequency (8–10 waves per minute)
- low typically under one metre in height
- typically found in sheltered bays and spits
- build up sandy beaches
- more common in summer
- weak backwash strong swash.

#### Destructive waves [Destructive-wave\\_orig.png \(1073×800\)](https://www.thegeographeronline.net/uploads/2/6/6/2/26629356/destructive-wave_orig.png) [\(thegeographeronline.net\):](https://www.thegeographeronline.net/uploads/2/6/6/2/26629356/destructive-wave_orig.png)

- usually very tall and steep
- a short wavelength
- very frequent
- weak swash strong backwash
- more common in winter
- erosion is greater.

Coastal fetch: Fetch is just the maximum length of open water over which the wind can blow. Typically, the bigger the fetch, the greater the wave energy and more destructive the wave is.

Waves have greater energy in the wintertime due to increased storm activity and stronger winds, making the waves more destructive. As a result, there is greater coastal erosion in the winter making the beach profile steeper.

Waves have less energy in the summertime due to a reduction in storm activity and lighter winds, making the waves more constructive. As a result, there is greater coastal deposition in the summertime making the beach profile gentler.

| 1.2.3 Development of erosional landforms | Learners should understand how coastal processes interact to create the following erosional landforms: <ul><li>cave, arch, stack, stump sequence</li><li>cliffs</li><li>headlands and bays</li><li>wave cut platform. Learners should know an example of a local or Welsh coastline where erosional landforms can be located.</li></ul> | Cave – Arch – Stack - Stump sequence: <ul><li>Destructive waves erode a headland made of impermeable rock through hydraulic action and abrasion.</li><li>A weakness runs through the headland such as a joint or bedding plane. This is more easily eroded.</li><li>The joint widens to form a wave cut notch.</li><li>Continual erosion causes the notch to enlarge to become a cave.</li><li>The cave erodes through the headland to become a coastal arch.</li><li>Weathering such as salt crystallisation and hydraulic action in the upper part of the headland weakens the roof of the arch until it eventually falls to the water below.</li><li>The remaining pillar of rock is a coastal stack.</li><li>Continual erosion and weathering cause the stack to collapse to form a coastal stump. For example: Green Bridge of Wales Diagram: https://bam.files.bbci.co.uk/bam/live/content/ztkmk2p/large. Stack Formation Video: Formation of a sea stack (timeforgeography.co.uk)</li></ul> |

{27}------------------------------------------------

Cliffs and wave cut platforms :

- At high tide, the waves erode the base of the cliff in the wave contact zone by processes such as hydraulic action, abrasion and solution .
- This creates a wave cut notch .
- Above the wave cut notch there is an overhang which gets progressively bigger with increased erosion .
- At the same time, the upper part of the cliff is weathered by processes such as freeze -thaw, salt crystallisation, carbonation and biological weathering, thus weakening the cliff.
- Eventually the overhang undergoes gravitational collapse to the beach below and the cliff retreats backwards .
- At the base of the cliff there is now a flat wave cut platform, with rock pools, that is visible at low tide but submerged at high tide .
- The wave cut platform indicates how far backwards the cliff has retreated over time .

Wave Cut Platform Diagram: [601981\\_orig.jpg \(469×349\)](https://geographicalstructures.weebly.com/uploads/5/1/6/5/51655785/601981_orig.jpg)  [\(weebly.com\)](https://geographicalstructures.weebly.com/uploads/5/1/6/5/51655785/601981_orig.jpg) .

Wave Cut Example: This is evident along the Glamorganshire Heritage Coast .

#### Headland and Bays :

- Form along coastlines with alternating geology (permeable and impermeable) .
- Permeable/ soft rock coastlines are more rapidly eroded and weathered backwards to form sheltered bays .
- Impermeable/ hard rock coastlines are more slowly eroded and weathered to form headlands .
- The headlands help to shelter the bays allowing sand to build up in the bays creating a beach .

Suggested learning activities: • landform identification on OS maps • landform identification from photographs • annotated diagrams to explain landform formation • compare OS maps of the same stretch of coastline over time to see how the landforms have changed • coastal fieldwork – field sketches of the different coastal landforms. 1.2.4 Development of depositional landforms Learners should understand how erosion, longshore drift and deposition interact to create the following depositional landforms: • beach • sand dune • spit. Learners should know an example of a local or Welsh coastline where depositional landforms can be located. Beaches: Composed of eroded sediment that has been transported via longshore drift from elsewhere along the coastline and then deposited. • Sandy beaches occur where waves have limited energy and where the water is shallow, such as in sheltered areas like bays. Constructive waves build up beaches with their strong swash and a weak backwash, depositing sediment. • Pebble beaches occur where cliffs are being eroded and weathered and where there are higher energy waves, resulting in greater amounts of mass movement to the beach below. Example of a sandy beach: Whitmore Bay. Example of a pebble beach: Cwm Colhuw Beach, Llantwit Major. Coastal spit: • Erosion, weathering and mass movement of a cliff provide the beach with material that is moved along a coastline by longshore drift.

{29}------------------------------------------------

- There is a sudden change in direction of the coastline, crating sheltered conditions allowing the sediment to be deposited.
- The material is deposited in a long, thin finger-like shape that extends out from the coastline.
- A hooked end often forms if there is a change in wind direction.
- Spits will continue to grow due to the continual sediment supply thanks to longshore drift, creating a coastal bar, unless they travel out across a river estuary.
- On a mature spit, sand dunes will develop.
- In the sheltered zone behind the spit, a salt marsh develops.

Coastal Spit Example: Ynyslas/Aberdyfi.

Coastal Spit Diagram: <u>3fddaa8140e4364184d4587fab658b5b.jpg</u> (931×439) (pinimg.com).

Sand dunes form where there is:

- a large supply of dry sand
- a large, flat beach
- strong onshore winds
- an obstacle on the beach for the dune to form against, e.g. driftwood.

#### Sand dunes:

- Wind blows sand onshore, and it hits an obstacle on the beach and gets deposited around it.
- The sand builds up to become an embryo dune.
- As you move backwards away from the beach, the sand dunes get older and bigger, such as the fore dune or yellow dune and mature dune.
- The dunes also become colonised with new plant species.
- The first plants are known as pioneers such as marram grass and sea rocket.

| 1.2.5 Human and physical factors that affect the rates of coastline change | Learners should understand: <ul><li>physical factors that affect rate of coastal change, including:</li><li>climate</li><li>fetch</li><li>geology – linking to concordant and discordant coasts.</li><li>human factors that affect rate of coastal change, including:</li><li>human activity such as settlement, industry and agriculture</li><li>hard and soft engineering/management</li><li>sustainability issues of managing coastal change.</li></ul> | Physical factors that affect rates of coastal change: <ul><li>Climate: Wind, that produces waves, influences how quickly sediment is moved along a beach by the swash and backwash of longshore drift; Storms generate destructive waves where the backwash has more energy than the swash, removing sediment from a beach and making it smaller; In summer there are more constructive waves, where the swash has more energy than the backwash, meaning that beaches are built up and made bigger by them.</li><li>Fetch: Longer fetches allow waves to gather more energy, leading to increased rates of erosion. For example, the fetch across the Atlantic affecting Cornwall is thousands of kilometres in length whereas the fetch affecting the east coast of England is much shorter.

{31}------------------------------------------------

Learners should know how these factors have influenced change along a stretch of local or Welsh coastline.

- Geology: The orientation of the geology influences the types of landforms produced.
- Concordant coastlines the different rock types are positioned parallel to the coast with erosion forming coves and long thin islands, e.g. the Dalmatian coast in Croatia.
- Discordant coastlines the different rock types are positioned 90° to the sea, leading to alternating bands of hard and soft rocks creating a coastline formed of bays and headlands, e.g. Pembrokeshire coast.
- Rocks that are more heavily jointed or has more bedding planes, will also be eroded more quickly. Diagram: [qGFVyKPmKIvuyK1FWpnYAQ\\_b.png \(555×372\)](https://o.quizlet.com/qGFVyKPmKIvuyK1FWpnYAQ_b.png)  [\(quizlet.com\).](https://o.quizlet.com/qGFVyKPmKIvuyK1FWpnYAQ_b.png)

Human factors that affect rate of coastal change include:

Hard engineering: permanent, manmade structures often involving technology

Groynes: Wood or rock barriers built 90° to the beach to stop/slow longshore drift and increase deposition

- Stop longshore drift, increasing deposition and beach size thus reducing rates of cliff erosion
- Starve down shore beaches of sediment causing beaches to become narrow, increasing cliff erosion.

Sea Wall: A wall made of hard rock or reinforced concrete that reduces the energy of waves when they hit it

- Prevent flooding
- Prevent/slow erosion
- Expensive to build and maintain in the long-term.
- Do not look attractive and can impede access to the beach.

{32}------------------------------------------------

.

Rock Armour: Large boulders or large piles of coral are piled up in front of eroding cliffs.

- Boulders absorb the wave energy, reducing/ slowing cliff erosion
- Can be moved away by storms
- Costs money to maintain and move the boulders back in place.

Soft engineering : Schemes that work with nature

Beach Nourishment: Sand is brought in and added to the existing beach to build it up.

- cheap to construct
- creates wider/higher beaches to reduce wave energy and block storm surges
- increases deposition
- must be done regularly as material is constantly removed by longshore drift
- effects sea life if sand is removed from offshore sand banks .

Dune Regeneration: Restoring sand dunes by stabilising them with sand and planting vegetation, such as marram grass, to hold the dune together.

- cheap to construct
- increases deposition and reduces erosion
- can only be done on coasts with existing sand dune s
- only offers protection from flooding for small areas of coastline .

Planting Mangrove Forests: Planting these salt-tolerant trees along the coastline reduces the energy of waves.

- cheap (used in LICs) and sustainable
- reduces wave energy and erosion
- increases rates of deposition
- can only be used in tropical locations.

Coastal locations are desirable places to live and work and so are becoming crowded. They are especially popular with elderly retirees e.g. Aberaeron in Ceredigion with 56.4% economically inactive (2021).

Coastal plains are popular with farmers using them for grazing animals.

Flat coastal areas are popular places to locate large power stations, oil refineries, ports and steelworks e.g. Port Talbot or Pembroke Dock.

Coastal areas are popular with tourist developments for example Barry Island – tourists visiting the beach can contribute to coastal erosion through carrying sand away on their feet.

Sand can be extracted/dredged from coastal areas for use in construction industry this can speed up rates of coastal erosion.

Shoreline Management Plans (SMP) are developed by councils in deciding how to manage a coastline. Options include:

- managed retreat allows the shoreline to move inland
- do nothing not implementing management plans in coastal areas
- hold the line management plans to keep the coastline in its current position
- advance the line build new coastal defences further out to sea
- hard and soft strategies.

{34}------------------------------------------------

SMP Example: Ceredigion County Council and Aberaeron Coastal Defence works 2024: Coastal Defence - [Ceredigion County Council.](https://www.ceredigion.gov.uk/resident/coast-countryside/coast-and-flood-risk-management/coastal-defence/)

#### Suggested Learning Experiences:

- diamond nine or rank order the different factors affecting coastal change in terms of significance and justify reasoning
- research a Welsh example of coastal flood management scheme and produce a fact file
- classify coastal management strategies
- complete an evaluation matrix on the different hard and soft management strategies
- identify stakeholders who would be for/against the different coastal management strategies and justify opinions
- analyse OS maps and photographs of coastlines impacted by industry or settlement.

{36}------------------------------------------------

The causes of forced migration include:

- escaping war/conflict Ukraine war
- human rights violation Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar
- famine Somalia and Ethiopia
- natural disasters/climate change Maldives and Tuvalu.

The causes of voluntary migration can be classified as:

- Push factors are the reasons that cause migrants to leave a country – migrants are pushed out by these factors.
  - economic: high unemployment levels
  - social: poor standards of education
  - environmental: drought and famine
  - political: unstable/corrupt governments
- Pull factors are the reasons that cause migrants to move to a country – migrants are attracted to these factors.
  - economic: improved employment prospects
  - social: joining family
  - environmental: less extreme climatic conditions
  - political: trade blocs.

#### **The list of push/pull factors is not exhaustive.**

Suggested named examples of voluntary economic migratory flows:

- Mexicans migrating into the USA
- Polish people migrating into the UK
- Syrian people migrating into Turkey.

Host country positive impacts: <ul><li>brain gains through welcoming educated migrants to work and contribute to the local economy</li><li>migrants share their cultural heritage: language, dress, foods, festivals, promoting diversity. Source country positive impacts:</li><li>reduced pressures on services such as education and healthcare</li><li>migrants send remittances back home.</li></ul> |

{38}------------------------------------------------

Host country negative impacts:

- segregation as some cultures struggle to integrate into the host country's society and this can lead to tension
- increased pressure on services such as housing, education and healthcare.

Source country negative impacts:

- brain drains as educated and skilled workers leave the country to work elsewhere e.g. doctors
- over-reliance on remittances.

#### **The list of impacts on the host/source country is not exhaustive.**

Impacts on the migrants:

- negative: might feel isolated and excluded from society, especially if dealing with a language barrier
- positive: opportunity to work, earn a decent wage and improve standards of living and quality of life.

#### **The list of impacts on the migrants is not exhaustive.**

Suggested named examples of voluntary international migratory flows:

- Mexicans migrating into the USA
- Polish people migrating into the UK.

In the circumstances the migration flow is forced:

- An asylum seeker is someone who flees their home country due to persecution or danger and seeks protection in another country but has not yet received official refugee status.
- A refugee is an individual who has been granted this status by a host country or international body, recognizing that they cannot safely return home due to war, persecution, or violence.

{40}------------------------------------------------

Visa Free Travel – to manage legal, short term stays e.g. tourism or transit :

- visa application is not required
- based on agreements between countries or regions
- travellers must meet entry requirements and may need to show proof of onward travel or sufficient funds
- for example, ESTA for US travel (from 2008) - [Official ESTA](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/)  [Application Website, U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/)  [\(dhs.gov\)](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/)
- for example: ETIAS for EU travel (from 2025) - ETIAS - [European](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/etias_en)  [Union \(europa.eu\)](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/etias_en) .

UNHDR: United Nations Declaration of Human Rights applies to everyone : [Universal Declaration of Human Rights | United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights)

- Article 3: Everybody has the right to life, liberty and security of person – providing the legislation to allow for safe refugee movements where people life, liberty or security are at threat .
- Article 13: Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state; Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country .
- Article 14: Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution; This right may not be invoked in the case of prosecutions genuinely arising from non -political crimes or from acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations .

UNHCR: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees - [UNHCR,](https://www.unhcr.org/)  [the UN Refugee Agency | UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/) – helps to ensure refugees can exercise their rights and provides them with necessary support .

These international policies help to protect refugees from deportation, especially if their return would result in harm.

{41}------------------------------------------------

Perception is about how a feature is regarded or understood.

Public perceptions can be both positive and negative and these are reinforced by various media representations/headlines.

#### Positive perceptions:

- contribute to the local economy
- fill labour shortages
- foster cultural diversity.

#### Negative perceptions:

- strain on services
- taking jobs from locals
- challenging national identify.

There are opportunities here to explore equality, diversity and inclusion contexts in terms of the examples selected.

#### Suggested Learning Experiences:

- map analysis of the main illegal migratory flows
- read newspaper articles/watch news reports on illegal migration into the UK - [what life is like for migrants who arrive on uk shores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_9kwOtCMZk)  [\(youtube.com\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_9kwOtCMZk)
- newspaper headline interpretation
- perception Venn diagram classification
- stakeholder perception justifications
- what would you do? design your own migration policy and justify your decision
- fieldwork: questionnaire on opinions and perceptions of migration and present the results.

| 1.4.1 Urbanisation | Learners should know what is meant by the process of urbanisation. Learners should understand how urbanisation rates have changed over time and between places. | Urbanisation is the process by which an increasing proportion of people live in urban area areas, resulting in urban areas growing in terms of aerial extent. Rates of urbanisation vary between HICs and LICs: <ul><li>HICs – High Income Countries</li><li>LICs – Low Income Country Urbanisation began in HICs with the onset of the industrial revolution whereas urbanisation in LICs/NICs it is more recent, beginning around 1950. Global urbanisation rates graph: 861474_orig.png (570×385) (thegeographeronline.net) – comparing rates in HICs and LICs. Urbanisation rates vary between different continents. Continental Urbanisation rates: 23349.jpeg (1200×1200) (statcdn.com) – comparing rates between continents. For a country to be classed as urban, over 50% of the population need to be living in urban areas. World Urbanisation rates: Urban population (% of total population) Data (worldbank.org). Urbanisation rates in UK: Urban population (% of total population) - United Kingdom   Data (worldbank.org). Urbanisation rates in Brazil: Urban population (% of total population) - Brazil   Data (worldbank.org).</li></ul> |

{43}------------------------------------------------

|  |  | Urbanisation rates in India: Urban population (% of total population) - India   Data (worldbank.org). There are two causes of urbanisation: <ul><li>rural to urban migration</li><li>natural population increases. Suggested learning activities:</li><li>graph construction to show urbanisation rates over time or between countries</li><li>graphical analysis</li><li>statistical analysis</li><li>comparison of rates of urbanisation between different countries.</li></ul> |

| 1.4.2 Urban land use patterns | Learners should understand: <ul><li>the similarities and differences between the urban land use patterns of cities in contrasting countries and the physical and human reasons for these differences</li><li>the characteristics of the different sectors of a city:</li><li>Central Business District (CBD)</li><li>rural-urban fringe</li><li>informal settlements</li><li>inner city</li><li>suburbs.</li></ul> | Land use is what the land is used for also known as its function/purpose. The main urban land uses include: <ul><li>residential</li><li>industrial</li><li>commercial/retail</li><li>administrative</li><li>infrastructure/transport</li><li>open space. Characteristics of the CBD include:</li><li>high-rise office buildings, hotels, and shopping malls</li><li>densely populated area with a mix of residential, commercial, and office buildings</li><li>crowded streets with lots of pedestrians and vehicles</li><li>very high land prices and property values</li><li>lack of open or green spaces.</li></ul> |

{44}------------------------------------------------

#### Characteristics of the Inner City include:

- high density of buildings
- lack of good quality open space (e.g., parks)
- older housing stock, including 19th-century low -cost housing (such as terraced houses)
- some industrial use
- poor quality housing with a scarcity of gardens
- gridiron street pattern
- presence of derelict land
- gentrified districts
- rebranded/repurposed industrial/historical/cultural buildings
- high rise luxury apartments
- gated communities
- tertiary industry: shopping and entertainment districts; hotels
- modern high-rise offices.

#### Characteristics of the Suburbs include:

- sprawling, low-density development
- predominantly single-family residential uses
- separation of retail and commercial uses
- car dependence so commuting rates high.

#### Characteristics of the Rural Urban Fringe include:

- mixture of land use, including residential areas, recreational facilities, and farming
- better quality housing with larger gardens and houses due to lower land values and more open space
- gradual change in types of buildings and land use as you move from the city centre towards the outskirts
- conflict between urban and rural ways of life
- impact of urban expansion on agricultural land.

{45}------------------------------------------------

#### Characteristics of informal settlements include:

- lack of security of tenure for land or dwellings
- few/no basic services
- poor infrastructure
- inefficient land use
- environmental degradation
- poor living conditions.

#### Features of a HIC city :

- the CBD is found in the centre
- land values in the CBD are high, so the most profitable shops and businesses locate here
- industries and factories develop in the inner city and along transport routes
- cheap, older, working class terraced housing lies close to the CBD in the inner city (with small plot sizes) and alongside the industry
- larger, more expensive, middle -class housing is found in the suburbs, where properties have gardens and garages
- high class housing is found in the rural -urban fringe locations, with increased distance from the CBD
- smaller, expensive luxury apartments are in redeveloped inner -city locations
- retailing is locating in the rural -urban fringe locations, such as retail parks and shopping malls
- diagram: [small \(304×461\) \(bbci.co.uk\)](https://bam.files.bbci.co.uk/bam/live/content/zygqhyc/small) .

#### Features of a LIC city :

- the CBD is in the centre
- high -cost housing is found close to the CBD and along some transport routes
- basic housing, known as the peripheria , is located between the high -cost housing and the informal settlements
- industries and factories develop along transport routes

{46}------------------------------------------------

- informal settlements are found around the edge of the city, where land values are lower
- image: set 012.gif (546×322) (bbc.co.uk).

#### Physical reasons for the land use differences

- availability of space to allow for urban sprawl
- gradient of land informal settlements often develop on unfavourable land, prone to landslides, such as steep slopes
- proximity to features such as river flood plains flood plains are flat and easier to build on although the flood risk makes them unfavourable and often informal settlements locate there
- coastlines.

#### Human reasons for the land use differences:

- bid rent and competition for the land driving up land prices
- sphere of influence retailing prefers central locations due to having a large sphere of influence
- nodal points and infrastructural patterns all road networks and public transport routes meet in the CBD making it most accessible.

#### Contrasting cities could include:

- Cardiff
- London
- Sao Paulo
- Mumbai.

#### Suggested learning activities:

- annotated sketch model of the land use of an urban area
- photograph analysis and interpretation of different sectors of the city
- most likely to exercise relating to the different urban land uses
- classification of characteristics in the different sectors of the city
- Venn diagram comparing land use in HICs and LICs
- OS map analysis to identify features of the different sectors of the urban area

| 1.4.3 Global cities | Learners should know: <ul><li>the difference between:</li><li>global cities</li><li>megacities</li><li>named examples of each of the above and their global location and distribution. Learners should understand why a city can be classed as a global city and why opinions on this vary.</li></ul> | Millionaire cities have over one million people living in them. Examples include London (9.6m) and New York (8.3m). Megacities have over 10 million people living in them. Examples include Paris (11.2m), Buenos Aires (16.8m), Tokyo (37.3m) and Sao Paulo (22.6m). City population data: Largest Cities by Population 2024 (worldpopulationreview.com). Global cities are cities that are connected to other cities/economic systems around the world through: <ul><li>finance – location of bank headquarters or stock exchanges</li><li>trade – international ports for exports and imports or locations of MNCs</li><li>governance – governmental buildings or centres of governance located there</li><li>diversity – popular host countries for international migrants</li><li>media – media corporations located there</li><li>cultural centres – location for entertainment venues such as stadiums</li><li>innovation – location for top rated universities or leading in research and development. Global cities are dominant cities that have a strong global influence. There are over 300 identified global cities.</li></ul> |

{48}------------------------------------------------

|  |  | Global cities can be classified as: <ul><li>Alpha++ cities much better connected to the global economy than any other city e.g. London and New York</li><li>Alpha+ cities that connect with the global economy e.g. Paris, Tokyo</li><li>Alpha cities that connect important economic regions with the rest of the world e.g. Los Angeles, Dublin.

| 1.4.4 Urbanisation in contrasting global cities | Learners should understand: <ul><li>causes and impacts of urbanisation</li><li>responses to the problems caused by urbanisation</li><li>sustainability issues with responses to the problems caused by urbanisation</li><li>specific cultural identities in two contrasting global cities.</li></ul> | Rural to urban migration is responsible for urbanisation within countries. Examples of contrasting global cities include: <ul><li>Sao Paulo</li><li>Mumbai</li><li>Cardiff</li><li>New York</li><li>Beijing. The causes of urbanisation are driven by natural population increase:</li><li>birth rate: the number of babies born per 1000 of the population</li><li>death rate: the number of deaths per 1000 of the population</li><li>natural population change: the difference between birth rate and death rate</li></ul> |

{49}------------------------------------------------

- natural increase: when the birth rate outweighs the death rate
- natural decrease: when the death rate outweighs the birth rate
- life expectancy: the average age a person is expected to live to.

Life expectancy is high in HIC countries and is increasing in LIC countries.

The causes of urbanisation are driven by push and pull factors.

In LICs/NICs such as Brazil or India:

#### Rural push factors include:

- economic: unemployment or low wages
- environmental: drought causing crop failure and famine
- social: poor living conditions and poor health/education services.

#### Urban pull factors include:

- economic: employment opportunities and higher wages
- social: improved living conditions and health/education services
- environmental: fertile soils and more tolerable climate.

In HICs such as London or Cardiff:

#### Rural push factors include:

- social: poor access to healthcare and education services
- economic: rural unemployment and lack or rural investment
- environmental: decline in availability of raw materials.

#### Urban pull factors include:

- social: improved access to healthcare and education services
- economic: advanced transport links (port, airport, motorways and wider infrastructure) and industrial growth encourages further industrial investment creating employment opportunities
- environmental: regeneration of the CBD/ inner city urban areas is encouraging re-urbanisation in recent years.

{50}------------------------------------------------

The impacts of urbanisation in LICs/NICs such as Brazil or India include:

- housing pressures and the creation of informal settlements
- overemployment and the creation of the informal sector
- healthcare pressures
- education pressures
- transport pressures
- pollution
- · congestion.

The impacts of urbanisation in HICs such as Cardiff or London include:

- housing pressures
- transport pressures
- healthcare pressures
- education pressures
- congestion
- pollution
- social segregation.

The response to the issues created by urbanisation in LICs/NICs such as Brazil or India include:

- self-help schemes
- site and service schemes
- relocation schemes
- developing exclusive enterprise zones such as the blue amazon
- slum clearance and redevelopment.

The response to the issues created by urbanisation in HICs such as Cardiff or London include:

- tackling urban deprivation and poverty
- social housing provision
- urban regeneration
- congestion charges and Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ).

{51}------------------------------------------------

#### Suggested learning examples:

- Calculating natural population change for different countries using birth rate and death rate
- graphical presentation of urbanisation rates in select global cities
- categorisation matrix or Venn diagram for the push and pull factors
- diary of a migrant outlining what life was like in rural areas and why they want to migrate to urban areas
- decision making when packing for a journey identifying what to take when migrating
- photograph analysis describing life in the informal settlements
- diamond nine ranking the issues of urban areas and justifying decisions
- decision making: solving the issues in the informal settlements.

#### <span id="page-52-0"></span>Learning Experiences

Learners should be encouraged to consider the following learning experiences and skills to further develop their understanding, appreciation and awareness of the subject content. Information in the table below provides opportunities for teachers to integrate the learning experiences into delivery.

| Learning Experience                                                                                                | Exemplification of Learning Experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Make appropriate use of digital technology when completing the qualification, | 1.1.3 Learners could access digital maps/GIS systems to identify features and landforms associated with drainage basins. |
| for example through accessing satellite images and digital maps | 1.4.2 Learners could access digital maps/GIS systems or satellite images to identify and analyse the characteristics of the different land use sectors as seen in HICs and LICs. |
| Develop empathy, tolerance, compassion and curiosity, through studying different geographical contexts | 1.3.1 Learners could investigate the causes of migration in different countries and assess the significance of different factors, including conflict, persecution, poverty and apply this knowledge to a justification for migration. |
|  | 1.4.4 Learners could assess the extent of the impacts associated with urbanisation in HICs and LICs, especially the negative impacts, and use this knowledge to help develop a sustainable plan for overcoming the issues. |
| Participate in educational visits (other than fieldwork) in person or digitally | 1.1.6 Learners could visit a location where river management strategies have been implemented to experience them first hand; they could also visit an HEP station such as Dinorwig, to understand how these schemes work and to visualise their scale. |
|  | 1.4.1 Learners could visit old industrial sites that helped encourage the onset of urbanisation, such as Big Pit or Rhondda Heritage Park to learn about the role of the mines in drawing people to urban areas during the 19th Century. |
| Engage in collaborative working | 1.1.4 Learners could work collaboratively conducting primary data collection on river landforms, such as measuring the changing depth across a river channel on a meander. |
|  | 1.3.3 Learners could collaborate in investigating changing perceptions on the different migration management strategies that have been implemented by different countries, before designing their own migration policy. |

#### Opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales

#### **Curriculum for Wales Strands**

#### **Cross-cutting Themes**

**There are many opportunities to include Local, National and International Contexts in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because geography encourages them to think about their sense of 'cynefin' and their sense of belonging to the UK and the wider world. These can be explored through real life case studies in Wales, the UK and from around the world across the different themes in the specification. Geography can help to ensure that learners are knowledgeable about their culture, community, society and the world, now and in the past.**

**Below are some examples of how Local, National & International Contexts can be embedded into teaching and learning:**

<span id="page-53-0"></span>

|  |  | Specification Reference | Amplification | Example |
|--|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  | Local, National & International Contexts | 1.1.2 | The drainage basin system | Teachers focus on applying this theory to a local drainage basin or a drainage basin in Wales. Learners could calculate mass balance within the drainage basin system, comparing inputs and outputs. |
|  |  | 1.1.3 | Drainage basin characteristics | Focussing on a local /Welsh drainage basin learners could identify features from an OS map or from photograph analysis. They could also visit the drainage basin to sketch/describe features when undertaking fieldwork. |
|  |  | 1.3.2 | Impacts of migration | Focussing on a national level, learners could evaluate how Wales has been impacted by migration flows. Learners could graph net migration figures for Wales and classify impacts (positive/negative) using a classification matrix. |
|  |  | 1.4.3 | Global cities | Learners to understand the characteristics of a global city and how they are linked to other countries around the world. Learners could map the different connections for two select global cities (e.g. Cardiff and Sao Paulo) to compare the different global connection. |

{54}------------------------------------------------

**There are many opportunities to include Sustainability in GCSE Geography. These opportunities are important to Learners because considering the sustainability of their actions in relation to global issues such as climate change, deforestation, over-abstraction of resources and population growth have never been more important than they are now. Learners should be encouraged to think how their actions now may relate to the sustainability of life on earth for future generations, something that could and should be considered across all the different themes in the specification. This gives them the chance to become ethical and informed citizens of Wales and the world, showing their commitment to the sustainability of the planet.**
