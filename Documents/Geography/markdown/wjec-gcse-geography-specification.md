# GCSE GEOGRAPHY

<span id="page-6-0"></span>

## 1. INTRODUCTION

<span id="page-6-1"></span>

### 1.1 Aims

GCSE Geography supports learners to:

- become independent, balanced and sympathetic geographers with a detailed understanding of spatial relationships and the changing world
- appreciate the complex, pluralistic and diverse nature of societies and their interactions with diverse and dynamic physical landscapes
- demonstrate a geographical viewpoint on values, attitudes and perspectives surrounding the interrelationships between people and their environment
- apply geographical understanding and practice to a range of contexts and enquiries
- foster a curiosity to explore geographical causes, effects and consequences
- make sense of the world to work towards a sustainable future.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales' Approval Criteria.

<span id="page-6-2"></span>

### 1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Geography qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification.

Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/statements-of-what-matters/)  [what matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/statements-of-what-matters/) and those [subject specific skills and concepts](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area) outlined in the '[Designing](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/designing-your-curriculum/)  [your Curriculum](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/designing-your-curriculum/)' section of the Humanities Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted in 'Opportunities for integration of learning experiences' on page 34, the Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

{8}------------------------------------------------

The GCSE Geography qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:

- supporting the statements of what matters[1](#page-7-0) by giving learners the opportunity to:
  - gain a deeper understanding of the concepts underpinning humanities, and their application in local, national and global contexts
  - help learners gather, justify, present, analyse, and evaluate a range of evidence
  - explore how and why interpretations may differ and by critical understanding of a range of interpretations and representations derived from a variety of evidence, be better placed to evaluate their validity
  - experience the wonder of the natural world
  - understand and appreciate how and why places, landscapes and environments in their locality and elsewhere in Wales, as well as in the wider world, are changing
  - develop an understanding of how human actions in the past and present can affect interrelationships between the natural world and people
  - heighten learners' awareness of how the future sustainability of our world and climate change is influenced by the impact of those actions
  - appreciate how the evolution of places, communities and societies is driven by the interplay between a range of factors, including environmental, economic, social, political and cultural processes and human actions
  - develop an understanding of their responsibilities as citizens of Wales and the wider interconnected world
  - develop as self-aware, informed, ethical global citizens, who critically reflect on their own and others' beliefs, values and attitudes.
- supporting the principles of progression[2](#page-7-1) by encouraging learners to:
  - ask increasingly sophisticated enquiry questions
  - demonstrate greater independence in finding suitable information, making informed predictions and hypotheses, and making judgments
  - increase their breadth and depth of knowledge and underlying concepts
  - develop an understanding of themselves in the world
  - demonstrate an ability to work with an increasing number and sophistication of sources of information, as well as a growing understanding of how to resolve contradictory or conflicting accounts
  - demonstrate a growing ability to transfer existing skills and knowledge into new, and increasingly unfamiliar contexts.

<span id="page-7-1"></span><sup>2</sup> <https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/principles-of-progression/>

{9}------------------------------------------------

- supporting the subject specific considerations for geography[3](#page-8-2) by:
  - providing opportunities to understand and investigate physical and human landscapes, and a context for the causes and consequences of physical and human inter-relationships and interdependence which characterise our modern world
  - providing opportunities to understand and investigate key geographical issues
  - equipping learners with the skills to question, use and analyse maps, images, and geographical information systems
  - equipping learners with the geographical skills to formulate research questions, and to collect, manipulate and present data so they can evaluate and think critically about problems and issues
  - providing a range of opportunities to learn outdoors, through fieldwork and the outdoor classroom, and to experience and reflect on the wonder of the natural world in a variety of physical, human and historical environments.

The GCSE Geography qualification is based on the following geographical concepts:

- place and space[4](#page-8-3)
- scale
- process
- continuity and change
- inter-relationships
- diversity
- environment
- interpretation.

Each of these concepts have been mapped to concepts stated within the Welsh Government 'designing your curriculum' guidance as well as those within the statements of what matters and progression steps for humanities.

<span id="page-8-0"></span>

### 1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of geography at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

<span id="page-8-1"></span>

### 1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE Geography has been designed to be delivered within 120 – 140 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

<span id="page-8-2"></span><sup>3</sup> <https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area>

<span id="page-8-3"></span><sup>4</sup> We have placed the two concepts together due to their natural inter-relationship.

{10}------------------------------------------------

<span id="page-9-0"></span>

### 1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

<span id="page-9-1"></span>

### 1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website [\(www.jcq.org.uk\)](http://www.jcq.org.uk/).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

<span id="page-10-0"></span>

## 2 SUBJECT CONTENT

<span id="page-10-1"></span>

### How to read the amplification

The amplification provided in the right-hand column uses the following four stems:

- 'Learners should be aware of' is used when learners do not need to understand all aspects of the specified content in detail. Teachers should refer to Guidance for Teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and breadth to which this content should be taught.
- 'Learners should know' is used when learners are required to demonstrate basic knowledge and understanding.
- 'Learners should understand' is used when learners are required to demonstrate greater depth of knowledge and understanding, application of knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and analysis and evaluation of information for a given purpose.
- 'Learners should be able to' is used when learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques.

The use of the word 'including' indicates that the specified content must be taught and could be subject to assessment.

The use of the words 'for example' or 'such as' indicates that the specified content is for guidance only, and alternative examples could be chosen.

### 3.2 Arrangements for non-examination assessment

#### Unit 2: Overview

For this assessment learners are required to undertake a fieldwork enquiry following the six-stage enquiry process.

The assignment, which includes several tasks, will be issued to centres in an Assessment Pack via the WJEC Portal. Tasks are not intended to change for the lifetime of the qualification. The two selected themes will change annually. Centres can select **one** of the two themes. The themes are published in the Assessment Pack for Unit 2 for five years. This will be updated to ensure there are always five years' worth of themes to allow for forward planning. Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the year learners undertake the assignment. However, it is important that centres select the topic from the year that they plan to submit the work for marking as this may be different to the year that the candidates undertake the assessment. If candidates choose to resit this unit at a later date, they must undertake a fieldwork enquiry for one of themes selected for the academic year they are submitting.

This assessment contributes to 25% of the overall qualification grade and will take 7 hours for candidates to complete the tasks (this does not include the time it takes to undertake the fieldwork). The tasks will be marked out of a total of 90 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be set and marked by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be handwritten and scanned, or completed digitally).

Centres will be expected to carry out fieldwork for the Unit 2 enquiry on one day, outside the classroom and school grounds. This must be accompanied by a fieldwork statement, signed by the Head of Centre, outlining the date, location and nature of the fieldwork conducted. Centres are encouraged to undertake further fieldwork during the course, either to support learning or to practice for the Unit 2 enquiry, however this is not required to be declared on the fieldwork statement.

#### Unit 4: Overview

For this assessment learners are required to undertake a decision making exercise based on a Resource Pack that contains sustainable issues with a number of possible options. In Phase 1 of the decision making, candidates will need to research the issue beyond the Resource Pack. Candidates should then produce a maximum of two sides of A4 notes to be used during the assessment. These notes will be submitted alongside the response to the tasks.

The assignment, including the Resource Pack, will be released during the first week of September for assessment in that academic year. The Resource Pack will change annually. Learners should not have access to the Resource Pack until the start of the assessment. Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the year learners undertake the assignment.

This assessment contributes to 15% of the overall qualification grade and will take 6 hours to complete. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions. The assignment will be marked out of a total of 60 marks.

{39}------------------------------------------------

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be marked by the centre and moderated by WJEC. Assessments must be submitted digitally (they may be handwritten and scanned, or completed digitally).

## 4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for GCSE Geography.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our [Guide to preventing, reporting and](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)  [investigating malpractice.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC [\(malpractice@wjec.co.uk\)](mailto:malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet [Suspected](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)  [Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)

## 5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

<span id="page-40-1"></span>

### 5.1 Entries and awards

This is a unitised qualification. Candidates are entered for each unit separately.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer assessment period each year, until the end of the life of the specification.

Unit 1, Unit 2 and Unit 3 will be available in 2026 (and each year thereafter). Unit 4 will be available in 2027 (and each year thereafter) and the qualification will be awarded for the first time in summer 2027.

Pre-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or under on 31st August in the academic year in which they were entered)

The terminal rule is set at 40% of the overall qualification for Pre-16 Candidates for GCSE Geography.

If the assessment being re-taken contributes to the 40% terminal rule requirement, the mark for the new assessment will count regardless of previous results in that assessment.

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade subject to the terminal rule being satisfied first, i.e. that candidates must complete 40% of the assessment for a qualification in the series in which they are cashing in.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s). This is referred to as a 'fresh start'. When retaking a qualification (fresh start), a candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from examination units taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating the new grade(s).

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be used for the life of the specification.

Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1st September in the academic year in which they are entered)

There is no terminal rule that applies to Post-16 Candidates for GCSE Geography.

There is no limit on the number of times a candidate can resit an individual unit; however, the better uniform mark score from the most two recent attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade.

The 'fresh start' rule does not apply to post-16 candidates.

{42}------------------------------------------------

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be used for the life of the specification.
