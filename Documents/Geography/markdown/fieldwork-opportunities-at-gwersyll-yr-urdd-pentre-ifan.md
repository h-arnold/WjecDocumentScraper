## METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH – Change Over Time and Transects

Explore the sand dunes of Trefdraeth: vegetation, gradient, soil pH, and human impact.

**Examples of Curriculum-Aligned Fieldwork** 

- Visit popular beaches to assess coastal erosion and the geographical processes involved
- Analyse the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park's 'Changing Coast' archive.

#### **Oualitative Surveys**

- Assess the impact of honeypot sites on local communities.
- Take a walk through the ancient woodland of Tŷ Canol: biodiversity, ecosystems, and the carbon cycle.

#### Conceptual Framework – Place

- Use OS maps to sketch and identify key features: contour lines, grid references, and map symbols.
