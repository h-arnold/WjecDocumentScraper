(g) The grid box referred to in Question 2 (e) Map 1 contains meanders and oxbow lakes on the River Severn. Meanders on the River Severn are also shown in Photograph 1.

The stages in the formation of oxbow lakes are shown in Diagram 2 below.

**Diagram 2: Oxbow Lake Formation**

The following statements explain the formation of an oxbow lake and are represented with a letter A to F on diagram 2 above.

Complete the table by matching each statement from the table to a letter on Diagram 2. **A** has been completed for you.

| Water flows slowly on the inside bend of the meander.                                                                                                   |        |
| Continuous lateral erosion causes the neck of the meander to become increasingly narrow. |  |
| Deposition occurs in this low energy environment and a slip off slope is formed that begins to block the channel. |  |
| In times of high discharge, the neck of the meander cuts through from each side |  |
| Water flows quickly on the outside bend of a meander. Lateral erosion (hydraulic action) occurs in high energy conditions creating a river cliff. | A |
| Eventually the deposition will build up and block the channel, isolating the meander loop to form an oxbow lake. |  |

(a) Groynes are marked on Map 2 in grid box 6091 and shown on Borth beach in Photograph 3. Boulder Reefs are shown on Photograph 4 being constructed on Borth beach. Both defences are examples of hard engineering methods that are used to protect coastlines around the UK from beach erosion and flooding.

#### **MARK SCHEME**

#### **Guidance for examiners**

#### **Generic marking principles**

- Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
- Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.
- Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
- Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

#### **Positive marking**

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising candidates for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates' answers. The list is not exhaustive. The inclusion of *'Credit any other valid response.*' (or similar instruction) within mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates' responses. Credit should be given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates' answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However, unless there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks where the answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

#### **Banded mark schemes**

For band marked questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in candidates' answers. It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate's response. As noted above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive and candidates do not have to include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been provided, no marks should be awarded.

{26}------------------------------------------------

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each candidate's response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills, knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors or omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate's answer to pick out the evidence that is being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied. This is done as a two-stage process.

#### **Stage 1 – Deciding on the band**

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate's answer and check whether it matches the descriptors for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the descriptors most closely matches the work.

#### **Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark**

Having determined the appropriate band, deciding on the mark within a band will be made on the basis of a 'best fit' procedure, weaknesses in some areas being compensated for by strengths in others.

Examiners should use the full range of marks available to them. Marking should be positive, rewarding achievement rather that penalising failure or omissions. The awarding of marks must be directly related to the marking criteria, and all responses must be marked according to the banded levels provided for each question.

Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be provided during standardising and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work. Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the standardising material as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the work submitted.

This mark scheme instructs examiners to look for and reward valid alternatives where indicative content is suggested for an answer. This is not a checklist for expected content in an answer, or set out as a 'model answer', as responses must be marked in the banded levels of response provided for each question. Where a candidate provides a response that contains aspects or approaches not included in the indicative content, examiners should use their professional judgement to determine the validity of the response in light of the task and reward as directed by the bands. Candidates are free to choose any approach that is relevant to the set task. Candidates can (and will most likely) incorporate ideas other than those mentioned in the mark scheme.

(g) The following statements explain the formation of an oxbow lake and are represented with a letter A to F on diagram 2 above. Complete the table by matching each statement from the table to a letter on Diagram 2. **A** has been completed for you. Award **one** mark for each correctly identified statement: Letter Water flows slowly on the inside bend of the meander. <sup>B</sup> Continuous lateral erosion causes the neck of the meander to become increasingly narrow. C Deposition occurs in this low energy environment and a slip off slope is formed that begins to block the channel. E In times of high discharge, the neck of the meander cuts through from each side <sup>D</sup> Water flows quickly on the outside bend of a meander. Lateral erosion (hydraulic action) occurs in high energy conditions creating a river cliff. **A** Eventually the deposition will build up and block the channel, isolating the meander loop to form an oxbow lake.

(c) Twyni Bach spit is shown in Photograph 2 and is labelled on Map 2. Describe how a spit is formed.

#### **Indicative Content**

#### Answers may refer to:

- Longshore drift transports eroded sediment along the coastline in the direction of the prevailing wind. Where there is a sudden change in direction of the coastline, for example at a river mouth, sediment is carried out to sea where it is deposited. This creates a new strip of land or beach which projects out into the sea and remains attached to the land at one end. This is called a spit.
- In the sheltered water behind a spit, a salt marsh forms. Sometimes a spit has a hooked end as a result of changes in the wind direction. Spits constantly change in shape and size due to erosion from wind and the sea and deposition as longshore drift continues.
- Spits do not extend right across the river mouth as strong river currents carry material out to sea.

Credit any other valid response. Examples of spits may be given e.g. Spurn Head, East Yorkshire or Morfa Harlech in Gwynedd. Do not credit description of longshore drift or reference to bars or tombolos.

(b) 'Many people think that hard defences are the only method that should be used when protecting settlements along the coastline of Wales and the UK.'

Assess how far you agree with this view. You may refer to resources in this paper and your own studies in your answer.

#### **Indicative Content**

This is an evaluative question. Answer must comment on the strength and weaknesses of both hard and soft engineering strategies before reaching a conclusion/opinion in relation to the statement.

Hard strategies include:

- Sea Walls
- Rip Rap
- Gabions
- Revetments
- Groynes.

All provide protection for key locations and reflect wave energy away from areas that need protection. Groynes help build up a beach to absorb wave power and slow down erosion. All these are expensive to build, however, and require constant maintenance. They can also look ugly e.g. concrete sea walls in well-known coastal locations. Wave energy is also transferred elsewhere on the coast, with erosion as a consequence.

Soft engineering strategies include:

- beach nourishment
- sand dune stabilisation
- managed retreat.

These involve working with the sea and providing chances for wave energy to be absorbed or low value land to be flooded to save high value land. Beach nourishment and sand dune stabilisation need constant attention however and sometimes may work in line with hard defences anyway. Managed retreat can be controversial e.g. people who own properties in land that is not being protected can be affected.

Examples will include a range of locations across Wales and the UK. For example, some candidates may use Borth in Ceredigion, whereas some may use Mappleton on the Holderness Coast in East Yorkshire. Give credit for specific references and detail from these locations e.g. groynes, rip-rap boulders and beach replenishment in Borth as seen in the paper, or reference to the boulder walls and rock groyne at Mappleton and the knock-on effects they have had further south in villages like Great Cowden.

Credit any other valid response.

**N.B** The answer can argue for hard or soft defences, a mix of the two or none at all. Credit can be given for all approaches as long as 'how far do you agree' is addressed at the end.

|  | (b) | There are many different reasons for international migration. Outline possible push and pull factors associated with international migration. examples in your answer. |  |  | Use |  |

#### **Indicative Content**

Content could include a range of push and pull factors and be drawn from economic, social, environmental and political angles.

#### Pull factors could include:

- joining family already in the host country
- seeking safety from environmental disasters
- seeing the host country as a perceived safe haven from political persecution
- seeking better paid employment than in the source country
- freedom of movement between countries e.g. around the EU.

#### Push factors could include:

- escaping war/civil unrest
- high unemployment/low paid jobs e.g. in agriculture and manufacturing in source country
- family and friends have already migrated
- environmental refugees fleeing from flooding, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes
- impacts of climate change (e.g. famine and/or drought, sea level rise, wild fires and extreme heat).

Examples could come from a wide range of countries e.g. Mexicans migrating to the USA, Polish migration to the UK or Syrian migration to Turkey. Examples could also come from conflicts at the time of study e.g. Ukrainian migrants to the UK and other European countries in 2025, or be historic in nature e.g. migration from Commonwealth countries to the UK after World War 2.

Examples will likely contain push and pull factors and credit should be given for defining these within the answer.

{40}------------------------------------------------

(d) Discuss impacts of international migration on **one** named source country and **one** named host country you have studied

#### **Indicative Content**

Impacts selected should be appropriate to the countries selected. Impacts could include:

- spread and appreciation of other cultures in the host country
- money sent home in remittances to families in the home country
- integration into the host country society creating first- and second-generation families
- population density and unemployment in the source country is reduced
- host country receives skilled migrants to fill key positions e.g. healthcare professionals, and migrants willing to do low paid, menial jobs so a range of employment is available
- migrants who return home are often more skilled, experienced and talented
- reduces labour shortages in the host country
- segregation/discrimination/racism/alienation of migrants in the host country often occurs
- use of detention centres often keeping migrants in poor, prison like conditions
- highly skilled migrants often end up in low paid jobs not suited to the knowledge and skills they can offer the host country
- high risk of death and disease during the migration journey
- brain drain from the source country
- increased pressure on housing, services and amenities in the host country
- break up of families in the source country if some family members migrate and some stay at home.

Examples could vary but might include Mexicans to the USA, Polish (and other EU) migrants to the UK since 2004, African, Caribbean & Asian Migrants to Europe (historical and present day) or a recent environmental example e.g. Haitians to the USA (Florida) after the 2010 earthquake.

The barriers have official crossing points where migrants with visas can enter both countries but are otherwise patrolled by Border Officials from both countries aiming to intercept and send back irregular migrants. In some places double or triple walls/fences are used to as a further deterrent to migrants trying to cross. Migrants who do cross and are caught are repatriated to their countries of origin in Central and South America or held in migrant detention centres whilst their claims are processed.</li></ul> |  |  |  |  |

(e) Discuss responses to problems caused by urbanisation in **one** global city you have studied.

#### **Indicative Content**

Answers should be clearly set in the context of one global city and make specific reference to responses to the problems caused by urbanisation in that city. As this global city may come from all parts of the world and countries at different levels of development, a wide range of answers may be seen.

Responses to problems caused by rapid urbanisation in a LIC/NIC global city e.g. informal settlements, traffic congestion, high crime rates, overcrowding and homelessness, vulnerability to climate change impacts :

- Clearance of settlements to build new developments in Mumbai, causing residents to leave and set up a new informal settlement elsewhere.
- New houses are sometimes provided on better quality land, made from solid materials and with running water, electricity, toilets and security of tenure, as seen in parts of Dharavi, Mumbai. When rebuilding is not possible, current houses are being provided with clean water and toilets, to improve hygiene and reduce the risk of disease.
- City councils are implementing self-help building schemes with building materials provided to make houses stronger, more stable and secure.
- Connection of legal electricity, to avoid issues with illegal connections and the danger they can bring to residents.
- Transport developments to make communications easier, often innovative approaches are taken e.g. the Teleferico gondola in Complexo de Alemao in Rio de Janeiro connecting informal settlements to the city Metro system in order to improve connectivity from informal settlements to city centres. However, the Rio Teleferico Gondola is currently closed due to lack of funds for maintenance.
- Provision of extra Police and crackdowns on gang violence to make residents feel safer, most notably seen in the run-up to the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Though, preference is often given to more visible settlements e.g. the clean ups and crime crackdowns applied to favelas near the airport and Olympic site.
- Tours of informal settlements educate visitors to the problems and allow residents to feel informed of efforts to improve knowledge and awareness of issues they face.
- Dar es Salaam in Tanzania is restricting construction in areas vulnerable to rising sea levels and floods. Families are given rights to buy their homes and then move from informal settlements at risk into safer neighbourhoods with simple housing and basic services e.g. water, toilets and drainage.

Responses to problems caused by urbanisation in a HIC global city e.g. urban sprawl, traffic congestion, loss of green spaces, zones of deprivation & poverty:

- Green belts designated to prevent further urban sprawl into the countryside around cities such as London and Cardiff.
- Urban regeneration to improve derelict/disused areas e.g. Cardiff Bay, London Docklands through building of new houses, flats, industry and leisure facilities.
- Use of brownfield sites over greenfield sites for new developments, linked to the two points above. However, there are additional costs with brownfield development in the UK e.g. costs of pollution clean ups.
- Transport improvements e.g. South Wales Metro train improvements to make better commuting opportunities into Cardiff from the Valleys and surrounding areas, improving air quality and taking
