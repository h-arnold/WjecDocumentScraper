# <span id="page-40-0"></span>Learning Experiences

Learners should be encouraged to consider the following learning experiences and skills to further develop their understanding, appreciation and awareness of the subject content. Information in the table below provides opportunities for teachers to integrate the learning experiences into delivery.

| Learning Experience                                                                                          | Exemplification of Learning Experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Participate in educational visits in person or digitally | Virtual tours of important locations in the Crusades. This includes the cities of Rome, Constantinople, Jerusalem and Acre (modern Akko) |
| Develop empathy, tolerance, compassion and curiosity through studying different historical contexts | The study of the divisions within Christianity and Islam are the sources of conflict in the Crusades, but at various points during the period, tolerance between these different religious views existed within the Holy Land. Persecution of the Jewish community both within the Holy Land and in communities in Europe occurred, even when Latin and Greek Christians were able to put their differences aside to work together. |
| Engage in collaborative working | There are many examples for discussions, such as: how powerful the Byzantine Empire was compared to its Muslim neighbours; how effective Richard I was as a military leader – does this mean that he was an effective Crusader as well?; the reasons for the failure of the Fourth Crusade – which was the most important reason for this failure?; whether diplomacy or warfare were more important in the outcome of the Fifth and Sixth Crusades, as well as the Baron's Crusade. |
|  | The are also opportunities for debates, such as: the reasons for the failure of the Second Crusade – one side arguing it was the strength of the Muslim forces, the other side arguing it was the weaknesses of the Crusader; who better deserves to be remembered as a hero of the Crusades – Salah ad-Din or Richard I? |

| Local, National & International Contexts | Unit 3 provides centres with six different historical topics relating to world history. The optional topics provide opportunities to enhance learners' understanding of the world and the diverse experiences of its peoples. Options allow for the study of marginalised regions of the world, the histories of dispossessed peoples and forgotten empires, especially of the global South. Option 3.2 Medieval: The Crusades, c.1095–c.1291 allows centres and learners to explore medieval history within Europe and the Near East. The focus ranges from the conflicts over territory and cities in the Holy Land like Jerusalem, centres of decision-making in places like Rome and Constantinople, but also localities in Wales who provided pilgrims and knights who took part in the Crusades, and which are mentioned in |  |  |
| Relationships and Sexuality Education | Gerald of Wales' account of attempts to gain support for the Third Crusade in Wales itself. Learners will study the changing relationships between followers of Latin and Greek Christianity, as well as the relationships between Christians, Jews and Muslims in the Holy Land. Sometimes these were violent relationships, sometimes tolerant ranging from warfare to peaceful co-existence. For example, learners will learn how the First Crusade came to be organised, including the Byzantine request for military support, early events of the First Crusade, including the People's Crusade and the attacks on Jews in Europe, and the massacre of Muslims and Jews in Jerusalem when the crusaders arrived. |  |  |
| Human Rights Education and Diversity | Learners will understand that the participants in the Crusades represented a wide range of ethnic groups as the Holy Land was adjacent to Asia, Africa and Europe. A range of religions are also part of the Crusades – Christianity, Islam and Judaism. Empires were also part of the Crusades, whether it was the spiritual empire of Latin Christianity or the political/religious empire of Greek Christianity. Colonialism also forms part of this topic, whether it is the crusaders establishing the crusader kingdoms, or the expansion of the territories of Islamic groups like the Seljuk Turks or the Mamluks. |  |  |

# Careers and Work-Related Experiences

There were lots of job opportunities available for the people of Wales, Europe and the Near East that are not really part of the work that people in these places do today. Very few people today would choose to be priests or monks.

The roles of crusading military orders like the Templars, Hospitallers and the Muslim challenge to the Crusades, including the Muslim military forces show that careers in the military in the past were very different to those today. Military service now results in large amounts of professional training and expectations that the amateur knights and soldiers of the crusades would not be familiar with.

{43}------------------------------------------------

#### **Cross-curricular Skills – Literacy**

There are many opportunities to include literacy in GCSE History. These opportunities include the analysis of source material, extended writing opportunities, vocabulary development, debating and discussion. These opportunities are important to Learners because they will develop cross-curricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the Curriculum for Wales, as well as communication skills which can be used across subjects and prepare them for future education or employment.

Below are some examples of how literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learners will have the opportunity to assess the accuracy and reliability of source material and share views through discussion and verbal questioning techniques when being taught the specification content.

#### **Examples**

# Listening

- Learners are encouraged to debate and respond to the views of others.
- Learners will have opportunities to listen to podcasts and recordings in order to develop their vocabulary and listening skills.
- Use of oral history and interviews develop listening skills and the ability to respond to others appropriately.
- Learners have the opportunity to share and respond to peer presentations.

Learners will have the opportunity to read contemporary source material as well as a variety of historical interpretations, before critically evaluating the sources, analysing their content, and comparing and contrasting sources focusing on the interpretation they give on events.

# Reading

#### **Examples**

- Learners can use a range of reading techniques such as skimming and scanning or reading for a purpose.
- Reading extracts from a wide range of sources such as speeches, articles, diary extracts, historians and newspapers.
- Comparing and contrasting the content of historical sources.
- Assessing the reliability and accuracy of the text to develop the skill of critical reading.

{45}------------------------------------------------

# **Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy**

There are many opportunities to include numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to Learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

#### **Examples**

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learning that statistics represent data and that probability models chance help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

#### **Examples**

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

{46}------------------------------------------------

#### **Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competence**

There are many opportunities to include digital competence in GCSE History. Learners can make use of digital technology to access a broad range of historical sources and to undertake research of a historical topic. Learners will also have the opportunity to develop their digital skills in preparing and completing their non-examination assessments. These opportunities will allow learners to develop cross-curricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as allowing further access to historical information while fostering current and future critical thinking and ethical awareness.

Below are some examples of how digital competence can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

| Citizenship | Learners will develop an understanding of the importance of attributions, including the use of resources in digital formats such as e-books and online articles. Learners will be required to address attributions when analysing items for their historical enquiry and to think critically about the authors of digital evidence. |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                  | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  | Learners should be made aware of copyright and plagiarism when looking at historical evidence and when developing and presenting their own arguments in relation to a topic. |
|                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Interacting and Collaborating | Learners can work collaboratively (digitally) on tasks in preparation for the exam. These could include peer assessment, responding to teacher feedback or work creation. |
|                                  | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|                                  | In groups, learners could research and present a topic to introduce an area of study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
