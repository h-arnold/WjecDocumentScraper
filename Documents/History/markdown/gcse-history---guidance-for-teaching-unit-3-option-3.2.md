# <span id="page-5-0"></span>Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE History consists of four units. The combination of options selected for Units 1, 2 and 3 must include one medieval, one early modern and one modern unit.

In Unit 4, centres can choose to repeat a time period previously studied in Units 1, 2 or 3. **However, the topics chosen for study in Unit 4 must not replicate or overlap with the content of any of the other selected units.**

The qualification is unitised and does not contain tiering. There is no hierarchy to the order the units should be taught.

| Local, National &<br>International Contexts | Unit 3 provides centres with six different historical topics relating to world history. The optional topics provide opportunities to enhance learners' understanding of the world and the diverse experiences of its peoples.<br>Options allow for the study of marginalised regions of the world, the histories of dispossessed peoples and forgotten empires, especially of the global South.<br>Option 3.2 Medieval: The Crusades, c.1095–c.1291 allows centres and learners to explore medieval history within Europe and the Near East. The focus ranges from the conflicts over territory and cities in the Holy Land like Jerusalem, centres of decision-making in places like Rome and Constantinople, but also localities in Wales who provided pilgrims and knights who took part in the Crusades, and which are mentioned in Gerald of Wales' account of attempts to gain support for the Third Crusade in Wales itself. |  |
| Relationships and Sexuality<br>Education    | Learners will study the changing relationships between followers of Latin and Greek Christianity, as well as the relationships between Christians, Jews and Muslims in the Holy Land. Sometimes these were violent relationships, sometimes tolerant ranging from warfare to peaceful co-existence.<br>For example, learners will learn how the First Crusade came to be organised, including the Byzantine request for military support, early events of the First Crusade, including the People's Crusade and the attacks on Jews in Europe, and the massacre of Muslims and Jews in Jerusalem when the crusaders arrived.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |  |
| Human Rights Education and<br>Diversity     | Learners will understand that the participants in the Crusades represented a wide range of ethnic groups as the Holy Land was adjacent to Asia, Africa and Europe. A range of religions are also part of the Crusades – Christianity, Islam and Judaism. Empires were also part of the Crusades, whether it was the spiritual empire of Latin Christianity or the political/religious empire of Greek Christianity.<br>Colonialism also forms part of this topic, whether it is the crusaders establishing the crusader kingdoms, or the expansion of the territories of Islamic groups like the Seljuk Turks or the Mamluks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |  |

{43}------------------------------------------------

## Careers and Work-Related Experiences

There were lots of job opportunities available for the people of Wales, Europe and the Near East that are not really part of the work that people in these places do today. Very few people today would choose to be priests or monks.

The roles of crusading military orders like the Templars, Hospitallers and the Muslim challenge to the Crusades, including the Muslim military forces show that careers in the military in the past were very different to those today. Military service now results in large amounts of professional training and expectations that the amateur knights and soldiers of the crusades would not be familiar with.

{44}------------------------------------------------

## Cross-curricular Skills – Literacy

There are many opportunities to include literacy in GCSE History. These opportunities include the analysis of source material, extended writing opportunities, vocabulary development, debating and discussion. These opportunities are important to Learners because they will develop cross-curricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the Curriculum for Wales, as well as communication skills which can be used across subjects and prepare them for future education or employment.

Below are some examples of how literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learners will have the opportunity to assess the accuracy and reliability of source material and share views through discussion and verbal questioning techniques when being taught the specification content.

### Examples

### Listening

- Learners are encouraged to debate and respond to the views of others.
- Learners will have opportunities to listen to podcasts and recordings in order to develop their vocabulary and listening skills.
- Use of oral history and interviews develop listening skills and the ability to respond to others appropriately.
- Learners have the opportunity to share and respond to peer presentations.

Learners will have the opportunity to read contemporary source material as well as a variety of historical interpretations, before critically evaluating the sources, analysing their content, and comparing and contrasting sources focusing on the interpretation they give on events.

### Reading

### Examples

- Learners can use a range of reading techniques such as skimming and scanning or reading for a purpose.
- Reading extracts from a wide range of sources such as speeches, articles, diary extracts, historians and newspapers.
- Comparing and contrasting the content of historical sources.
- Assessing the reliability and accuracy of the text to develop the skill of critical reading.

{45}------------------------------------------------

| Speaking | Learners will have the opportunity to develop their understanding of viewpoints and content through debate,<br>discussion, presentations and group work.                                                                                            |

{46}------------------------------------------------

## Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy

There are many opportunities to include numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to Learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

### Examples

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learning that statistics represent data and that probability models chance help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

### Examples

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

{47}------------------------------------------------

## Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competence

There are many opportunities to include digital competence in GCSE History. Learners can make use of digital technology to access a broad range of historical sources and to undertake research of a historical topic. Learners will also have the opportunity to develop their digital skills in preparing and completing their non-examination assessments. These opportunities will allow learners to develop cross-curricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as allowing further access to historical information while fostering current and future critical thinking and ethical awareness.

Below are some examples of how digital competence can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

| Citizenship                      | Learners will develop an understanding of the importance of attributions, including the use of resources in digital formats such as e-books and online articles.

These opportunities are important to learners to become more engaged in lessons and enjoy learning through stimulating tasks. Deeper understanding is developed through the encouragement for learners to take an active role in their learning. Examples • Learners will demonstrate creativity when developing responses, expressing their opinions about relevant historical issues and critically evaluating sources and evidence within assessments. • Learners have opportunities to be creative and innovative when presenting information and findings. Critical Thinking and Problem Solving There are many opportunities to include critical thinking and problem solving in GCSE History. These opportunities are important to learners because they develop the ability to think analytically, and to collect, reflect and critically evaluate evidence in order to make informed judgements on a range of topics. This skill can be applied to real-life scenarios. Examples • Learners will have opportunities to ask meaningful questions of source material and historical interpretations, as well as to evaluate them as part of their process of developing relevant critical arguments. • Learners will develop their ability to see issues from multiple viewpoints. • Studying continuity and change over time allows learners to develop their problem-solving skills that can be applied in their future lives. • Learners will evaluate sources and historical interpretations in terms of reliability, bias and purpose.

• Critical thinking and problem solving encourages independent learning and promotes the ability to come to

reasoned and informed decisions in other aspects of life such as further education or work.
