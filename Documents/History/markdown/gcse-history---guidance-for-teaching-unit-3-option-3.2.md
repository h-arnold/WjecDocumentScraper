## Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE History consists of four units. The combination of options selected for Units 1, 2 and 3 must include one medieval, one early modern and one modern unit.

In Unit 4, centres can choose to repeat a time period previously studied in Units 1, 2 or 3. However, the topics chosen for study in Unit 4 must not replicate or overlap with the content of any of the other selected units.

The qualification is unitised and does not contain tiering. There is no hierarchy to the order the units should be taught.

Persecution of the Jewish community both within the Holy Land and in communities in Europe occurred, even when Latin and Greek Christians were able to put their differences aside to work together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Engage in collaborative working                                                                     | There are many examples for discussions, such as: how powerful the Byzantine Empire was compared to its Muslim neighbours; how effective Richard I was as a military leader - does this mean that he was an effective Crusader as well?; the reasons for the failure of the Fourth Crusade - which was the most important reason for this failure?; whether diplomacy or warfare were more important in the outcome of the Fifth and Sixth Crusades, as well as the Baron's Crusade. The are also opportunities for debates, such as: the reasons for the failure of the Second Crusade - one side arguing it was the strength of the Muslim forces, the other side arguing it was the weaknesses of the Crusader; who better deserves to be remembered as a hero of the Crusades - Salah ad-Din or Richard I? |

| Local, National & International Contexts | Unit 3 provides centres with six different historical topics relating to world history. The optional topics provide opportunities to enhance learners' understanding of the world and the diverse experiences of its peoples. Options allow for the study of marginalised regions of the world, the histories of dispossessed peoples and forgotten empires, especially of the global South. Option 3.2 Medieval: The Crusades, c.1095-c.1291 allows centres and learners to explore medieval history within Europe and the Near East. The focus ranges from the conflicts over territory and cities in the Holy Land like Jerusalem, centres of decision-making in places like Rome and Constantinople, but also localities in Wales who provided pilgrims and knights who took part in the Crusades, and which are mentioned in Gerald of Wales' account of attempts to gain support for the Third Crusade in Wales itself. |
| Relationships and Sexuality Education    | Learners will study the changing relationships between followers of Latin and Greek Christianity, as well as the relationships between Christians, Jews and Muslims in the Holy Land. Sometimes these were violent relationships, sometimes tolerant ranging from warfare to peaceful co-existence. For example, learners will learn how the First Crusade came to be organised, including the Byzantine request for military support, early events of the First Crusade, including the People's Crusade and the attacks on Jews in Europe, and the massacre of Muslims and Jews in Jerusalem when the crusaders arrived.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Human Rights Education and Diversity     | Learners will understand that the participants in the Crusades represented a wide range of ethnic groups as the Holy Land was adjacent to Asia, Africa and Europe. A range of religions are also part of the Crusades - Christianity, Islam and Judaism. Empires were also part of the Crusades, whether it was the spiritual empire of Latin Christianity or the political/religious empire of Greek Christianity. Colonialism also forms part of this topic, whether it is the crusaders establishing the crusader kingdoms, or the expansion of the territories of Islamic groups like the Seljuk Turks or the Mamluks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Careers and Work-Related Experiences   | There were lots of job opportunities available for the people of Wales, Europe and the Near East that are not really part of the work that people in these places do today. Very few people today would choose to be priests or monks. The roles of crusading military orders like the Templars, Hospitallers and the Muslim challenge to the Crusades, including the Muslim military forces show that careers in the military in the past were very different to those today. Military service now results in large amounts of professional training and expectations that the amateur knights and soldiers of the crusades would not be familiar with.   |

## Cross-curricular Skills - Numeracy

There are many opportunities to include numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to Learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learning that statistics represent data and that probability models chance help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

## Examples

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

## Examples

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.

| There are many opportunities to include digital competence in GCSE History. Learners can make use of digital technology to access a broad range of historical sources and to undertake research of a historical topic. Learners will also have the opportunity to develop their digital skills in preparing and completing their non-examination assessments. These opportunities will allow learners to develop cross-curricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as allowing further access to historical information while fostering current and future critical thinking and ethical awareness. Below are some examples of how digital competence can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History. | There are many opportunities to include digital competence in GCSE History.
