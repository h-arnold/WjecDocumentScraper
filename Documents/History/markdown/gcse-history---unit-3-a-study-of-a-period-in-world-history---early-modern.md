 [15]

Item 1

Leo Africanus, a Spanish diplomat and author, writing in his book
The Cosmography and Geography of Africa (1526). Africanus was
born a Muslim but became a Christian and later wrote about his
experiences travelling throughout western Africa.

The houses of Timbuktu are huts made of clay with thatched roofs. In the centre of
Timbuktu is a mosque built of stone and there is a large palace where the king lives. The
people who live in Timbuktu are very rich, especially the strangers who have settled in the
country. The current king has given two of his daughters in marriage to two brothers, both
businessmen, because of their wealth. There are many wells containing clean water in
Timbuktu. When the River Niger floods water is delivered to the city. Grain and animals are
plentiful, so there is a lot of milk and butter available.

Item 2

Katie Amery and Teni Gogo, history teachers and authors, writing
in their textbook for 11 to 13-year-olds, African Kingdoms: West
Africa (2023)

By around 1450 Timbuktu was home to 100 000 people, twice as many as London at that
time, and it continued to thrive as part of the Kingdom of Songhai. The city was at the
centre of people’s social life. Many houses were built of stone and there was a large public
square where markets were held regularly. There was also at least one mosque: the
Djinguereber Mosque built by Mansa Musa before the Songhai Kingdom was established.

 [5]

[20]

Item 3

An anonymous author, writing in the general interest book The
Songhai Empire (2022). The book is part of the Captivating History
series, which claims to make history interesting, fun and useful.

The Battle of Tondibi was the final stand of the mighty Songhai. For most of the army and
animals used in the battle, it was their first time experiencing muskets and cannons. The
Songhai ruler offered the Moroccans gold and slaves to withdraw but they refused and
marched on Gao, destroying it. … By April, the Moroccans headed for the trading centres
of Djenne and Timbuktu with the aim of overrunning the kingdom. … The Moroccan army
looted and ransacked the ancient trading towns and brought the Songhai Empire to ruin
both economically and politically.

(a)  Describe the resolution of family conflict by Aurangzeb.

 [5]

(b)  Compare and contrast Item 1 and Item 2 as evidence for a historian

studying the impact of Aurangzeb’s religious piety.

[15]

Item 1

Bakhtawar Khan, a historian and advisor to the emperor
Aurangzeb, writing in his account of the political, social and cultural
aspects of the Mughal Empire Mir-at-i ‘alam [Mirror of the World]
(seventeenth century)

Hindu writers have been entirely excluded from holding public offices, and all the
worshipping places and great temples of these infidels [unbelievers] have been torn down
and destroyed in a manner so successful it has astonished people that such a difficult task
has been completed.

His Majesty (Aurangzeb) personally teaches the Muslim faith to non-Muslims with success,
and all the mosques in the empire are repaired at public expense.

Item 2

John Keay, a historian, journalist and presenter, writing in his
general interest book India: A history from the earliest civilizations
to the boom of the twenty-first century (2010)

Aurangzeb’s supporters argue that Shah Jahan also discriminated against non-Muslims
and targeted temples. Aurangzeb in fact destroyed few temples and to others he granted
the ability to raise money. The sites which were damaged were chosen because they were
a political or ideological threat … Even the jizya (the tax on non-Muslims) was not
unreasonable and the poorest were exempt from payment. Further, it seems unlikely that
the tax was collected at all in the remoter regions of the empire.

This is a two-part question. Answer part (a) then part (b). Part (b) must be
answered in continuous text.

(a)  Describe the key principles of Akbar’s divine faith.

(b)  Evaluate the view in Item 3 that Akbar’s rule was successful because it

marked a period of religious tolerance.

 [5]

[20]

Item 3

An anonymous author writing in the information page “Mughal
Empire (1500s, 1600s)” as part of the Religion section on the BBC
website (2009)

Akbar worked hard to win over the hearts and minds of the Hindu leaders. While this may
well have been for political reasons – he married a Hindu princess (and is said to have
married several thousand wives for political and diplomatic purposes) – it was also a part of
his philosophy.

Akbar believed that all religions should be tolerated, and that a ruler's duty was to treat all
believers equally, whatever their belief.

MARK SCHEME

Guidance for examiners

Generic marking principles

•  Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).

•  Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar

when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark
scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.

•  Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for
the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the
quality of the candidate responses seen).

•  Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme.
Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

Positive marking

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit
should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of
penalising him/her for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to
achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be
deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied
precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates’ answers. The list is not
exhaustive. The inclusion of ‘Credit any other valid response.’ (or similar instruction) within
mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates’ responses. Credit should be
given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates’ answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However,
unless there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks
where the answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

Banded mark schemes

For band-marked questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the
assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in
candidates’ answers. It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate’s response. As
noted above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive and candidates do not have
to include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the
requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it
contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been
provided, no marks should be awarded.

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each
candidate’s response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills,
knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors
or omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate’s answer to pick out the evidence
that is being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied.  This is done
as a two-stage process.

Stage 1 – Deciding on the band

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate’s answer and check
whether it matches the descriptors for that band.  If the descriptors at the lowest band are
satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band
until the descriptors match the answer.

If an answer covers different aspects of different bands within the mark scheme, a ‘best fit’
approach should be adopted to decide on the band and then the candidate’s response
should be used to decide on the mark within the band.  For instance, if a response is mainly
in band 2 but with a limited amount of band 3 content, the answer would be placed in band
2, but the mark awarded would be close to the top of band 2 as a result of the band 3
content.

Examiners should not seek to mark candidates down as a result of small omissions in minor
areas of an answer.

Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark

During standardising (the marking conference), detailed advice from the Principal Examiner
on the qualities of each mark band will be given.  Examiners will then receive examples of
answers in each mark band that have been awarded a mark by the Principal Examiner.
Examiners should mark the examples and compare their marks with those of the Principal
Examiner.

When marking, examiners can use these examples to decide whether a candidate’s
response is of a superior, inferior or comparable standard to the example.  Examiners are
reminded of the need to revisit the answer as they apply the mark scheme in order to
confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the response provided.

[5]

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is
not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

•  Music was important to the Songhai people with traditional instruments such as balafon

(percussion), djembe (drum), goje (one string fiddle) and lutes being played. Storytelling was
often done through song and was important to pass on culture and traditions through the
lyrics.

•  Songhai songs were often accompanied by traditional dances which they believed

connected people with the spiritual world. They would be performed in communal gatherings
and at special events such as weddings.

•  They wore traditional clothes with flowing robes and tunics made from cotton that were dyed
in vibrant colours. Men and women wore jewellery such as necklaces and bracelets made
from gold, silver and beads. Specific patterns were used on clothes and these had
significance, indicating, for example, tribal loyalty.

Explain why Sonni Ali’s military campaigns between 1468 and 1492 were important.

Indicative Content

Total
marks

[10]

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be
acceptable.

•  Sonni Ali’s campaigns expanded the Songhai territory and influence, making it one of the largest empires in West Africa. The conquest of

Timbuktu in 1468 gave the Songhai Empire control of the trans-Saharan trade routes, which increased the Empire’s wealth. By capturing cities
such as Djenne, Sonni Ali elevated the Songhai Empire’s political and cultural influence.

•  The campaigns led to a strengthening of central authority. Trading with areas incorporated into the Empire brought economic growth and

prosperity which required monitoring. The growing empire was divided into provinces that were overseen by governors or local chieftains who
were loyal to Sonni Ali. These men ensured that taxes, resources and a workforce were gathered effectively, and they reported to Sonni Ali.
•  Furthermore, campaigns provided the opportunity for Sonni Ali to strengthen the military and develop his tactics, including the use of a navy.

Canoes were used to travel along the River Niger and launch surprise attacks. The cavalry was developed, which was important in the capture
of Timbuktu and Djenne, to allow forces to move quickly. These military advances allowed Sonni Ali to launch further effective campaigns.

Describe the currency system in the Songhai Empire.

Indicative Content

Total
marks

[5]

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is
not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

•  Cowry shells were a common form of currency in the Songhai Empire, especially for low-

value transactions. They were accepted across large areas of West Africa making them easy
and reliable to use. They were effective as they could be easily counted and exchanged for
goods, such as textiles and food.

•  For high-value transactions, gold and silver coins were used as currency. Coins were often
minted in cities such as Goa and their value was based on their metal content and weight.
The most commonly used coin was the dinar, which was widely accepted and allowed trade
with other regions across Africa.

•  A bartering system was used in local markets where goods such as salt and ivory were

exchanged. In cities such as Timbuktu and Djenne, people traded goods such as food and
crafts directly.

Indicative Content

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be
acceptable.

Comparisons:
•  Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that Timbuktu was prosperous in the sixteenth century and that it was a thriving city.
•  Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that there was a mosque at the centre of Timbuktu showing the importance of Islam to the people.
•  Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that Timbuktu was a centre of trading. Item 1 states that there were many shops. Item 2 states that

markets were held regularly in the public square.

•  Both Item 1 and Item 2 show the importance of Timbuktu. Item 1 states that there was a palace where the king lived and Item 2 states that

it had more inhabitants than London at this time.

Contrasts:
•
•

Item 1 states that houses were huts made of clay with thatched rooves whereas Item 2 states many houses were made out of stone.
Item 1 states that Timbuktu was prosperous due to its location near the River Niger and the availability of water, whereas Item 2 states
that it was thriving as it was a part of the Songhai Empire.
Item 1 states that there was a mosque at the centre of Timbuktu and implies that this was an achievement of the Songhai, whereas Item 2
states that the Djinguereber Mosque was built by Mansa Musa, prior to Songhai control of the city.
Item 1 is a first-hand account and the personal opinion of Leo Africanus whereas Item 2 is from a textbook aimed at a younger audience
and therefore may be simplified.

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material

•  The battle took place on 13 March 1591 between the Songhai, led by Askia Ishaq II, and

the smaller Moroccan force, led by Judar Pasha.

•  The Moroccans set up a fortified position and used their artillery to bombard the Songhai

troops, leading to them fleeing the field or being massacred by enemy fire. The
Moroccans had superior weaponry such as firearms and cannons, but the Songhai used
traditional weapons such as spears and were reliant on the cavalry, which put them at a
disadvantage.

•  The Moroccans won the battle swiftly and there were significant Songhai casualties,

showing that their battle techniques were outdated. The Battle of Tondibi highlighted the
weaknesses of the Songhai Empire.

[20]

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be
acceptable.

•  The view expressed in Item 3, that the Songhai Empire collapsed due to the defeat at the Battle of Tondibi, has some credibility. The

Moroccan forces utilised their superior firearms and cannons during the battle, which decimated the Songhai forces. This destroyed Songhai
confidence. Failed peace negotiations led to further Moroccan expansion.

•  Following the success at Tondibi, the Moroccan capture of Goa and Timbuktu weakened the Empire’s ability to govern and caused instability
within the empire. The Moroccan attacks disrupted the trans-Saharan trade routes, which had an impact on the economic stability of the
Empire. Following this, the Songhai Empire fragmented, splitting into rival states, and never recovered.
Item 3 is from a general interest book which states its aim is to make history fun and therefore it may be simplified. As the author is unknown,
it is difficult to assess the level of their expertise in the history of the Songhai Empire, which limits its reliability.

•

•  Candidates may challenge the view by emphasising other factors. For example,they may argue that economic and environmental factors

were responsible for the collapse of the Songhai Empire. Drought caused crop failure, reduced food supplies and caused famine, which
weakened internal stability causing subsequent social unrest. The decline of the major trade routes reduced the flow of valuable goods, such
as salt and slaves, which were crucial to the economic stability of the Empire.

•  Further, leadership and succession problems led to the collapse of the Songhai Empire. When Askia Daoud died in 1582, there was no clear
succession plan leading to disputes amongst his descendants. Various rival claimants fought for control, weakening central authority and
causing instability. Successive rulers after Askia Daoud were weak and ineffective, which led to rebellions in parts of the Empire.

•  Candidates may ultimately judge that Tondibi was the main factor that led to the collapse of the Songhai Empire, they may argue that other
factors were more significant and fatally weakened the Empire before the Moroccan invasion, or they may judge that those factors impaired
the Empire badly and the Battle of Tondibi was the final straw.

marks

[5]

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is
not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

•  The battle was fought between Babur and the Sultan of Delhi, who had a larger number of

men. Despite this, Babur’s forces used new weapons such as muskets and cannons, which
gave him the advantage.

•  Babur used innovative military tactics such as dividing his army into smaller mobile groups.
He placed his cannons behind a fortified line of carts, which also protected his army but had
gaps to allow his cavalry to attack.

•  The Mughal cavalry attacked the Sultan’s forces from the rear whilst flanks of his army

advanced, resulting in Babur winning the battle.

Question 6

Explain why Mughal art and architecture developed during the rule of Shah Jahan.

Indicative Content

Total
marks

[10]

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be
acceptable.

•  Shah Jahan enjoyed dancing and music and was a patron of literature and learning. He instructed that works of mathematics and astronomy
written in Sanskrit be translated to Persian showing his desire to encourage learning. His reign is considered to be a golden age of cultural
development as he attracted poets, scholars and intellectuals from around the world to contribute to his cultural legacy.

•  During Shah Jahan’s rule, the Mughal Empire underwent significant economic growth that provided the resources for architectural projects. He

had an appreciation for gardens and water features, the use of marble, flower motifs and geometric patterns, which were incorporated into many
architectural projects with the aim of creating a paradise on earth. Shah Jahan created the Red Fort in Delhi to be an example of Mughal
architecture, incorporating red sandstone walls, marble palaces and ornate gateways. This was used as the main residence of Mughal
emperors for nearly 200 years, further demonstrating his architectural legacy. The Taj Mahal was built as a tomb for his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It
was opulent and visible to all, indicating his desire to leave an architectural legacy while also demonstrating his wealth and power.

•  Furthermore, there was religious motivation. He commissioned the construction of the Jama Masjid, one of the largest mosques in India, with

the aim of being a place for worship, but also becoming an example of architectural marvel.

Describe the resolution of family conflict by Aurangzeb.

Indicative Content

Total
marks

[5]

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is
not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

•  Aurangzeb dealt with family conflict by removing the people that opposed him and assuming

total control.

•  Aurangzeb eliminated the threat of his brothers as they each had a claim to the throne. He
defeated his eldest brother Dara Shikoh at the Battle of Samugarh in 1658. Shikoh was
subsequently executed in 1659. Aurangzeb also defeated Shah Shuja and Marus Baksh,
solidifying his claim to the throne.

•  To consolidate his power, Aurangzeb imprisoned his father, Shah Jahan, in the Agra Fort.
He spent the end of his life there living under house arrest, unable to have any influence
over the rule of the empire or the opportunity to disagree with Aurangzeb.

Question 7(b)

Compare and contrast Item 1 and Item 2 as evidence for a historian studying the impact of Aurangzeb’s religious piety.

Item 1:  Bakhtawar Khan, a historian and advisor to the emperor Aurangzeb, writing in his account of the political, social and cultural
aspects of the Mughal Empire Mir-at-i ‘alam [Mirror of the World] (seventeenth century)

Hindu writers have been entirely excluded from holding public offices, and all the worshipping places and great temples of these
infidels [unbelievers] have been torn down and destroyed in a manner so successful it has astonished people that such a difficult
task has been completed.

His Majesty (Aurangzeb) personally teaches the Muslim faith to non-Muslims with success, and all the mosques in the empire are
repaired at public expense.

Item 2:  John Keay, a historian, journalist and presenter, writing in his general interest book India: A history from the earliest
civilizations to the boom of the twenty-first century (2010)

Aurangzeb’s supporters argue that Shah Jahan also discriminated against non-Muslims and targeted temples. Aurangzeb in fact
destroyed few temples and to others he granted the ability to raise money. The sites which were damaged were chosen because
they were a political or ideological threat … Even the jizya (the tax on non-Muslims) was not unreasonable and the poorest were
exempt from payment. Further, it seems unlikely that the tax was collected at all in the remoter regions of the empire.

Indicative Content

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be
acceptable.

Comparisons:
•  Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that Hindus and non-Muslims faced discrimination.
•  Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that Hindu temples were destroyed during Aurangzeb's rule.
•  Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that Aurangzeb promoted Islam.
•  Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that there was religious and political motivation to the persecution of the Hindus.

Contrasts:
•

Item 1 states that Aurangzeb treated Hindus unfairly, for example not allowing them to hold public positions, whereas Item 2 states
Aurangzeb was reasonable and did not treat Hindus any worse than other Mughal rulers, for example Shah Jahan.
Item 1 suggests that Aurangzeb’s achievements (destruction of temples) were impressive given the difficulties of the task, whereas Item 2
suggests that Aurangzeb only damaged religious sites that were seen to be a threat and, in fact, few temples were destroyed.
Item 1 states that Aurangzeb successfully taught Islam to non-Muslims, whereas Item 2 focuses more on him treating non-Muslims fairly.
Item 1 is a focused history on Aurangzeb written by a contemporary advisor in praise of Aurangzeb's achievements, whereas Item 2 is a
more objective account from a much broader book on Indian History written in the twenty-first century.

Indicative Content

Total
marks

[5]

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material
is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

•  Akbar was the spiritual leader of his divine faith (Din-i Ilahi), which promoted unity and
religious tolerance. He encouraged the blending of different religious beliefs, including
Islam, Hinduism and Christianity, in order to have peace across the empire.

•  The divine faith promoted people leading a pious lifestyle and a focus on moral principles.

Akbar believed that loyalty, honesty and respect were key virtues.

•  There was the adoption of unique practices such as sun worship, and traditional Islamic

practices, such as pilgrimage, were discouraged.

Question 8(b)

Evaluate the view in Item 3 that Akbar’s rule was successful because it marked a period of religious tolerance.

Item 3: An anonymous author writing in the information page “Mughal Empire (1500s, 1600s)” as part of the Religion section on the
BBC website (2009)

Akbar worked hard to win over the hearts and minds of the Hindu leaders. While this may well have been for political reasons – he
married a Hindu princess (and is said to have married several thousand wives for political and diplomatic purposes) – it was also a part
of his philosophy.

Akbar believed that all religions should be tolerated, and that a ruler's duty was to treat all believers equally, whatever their belief.

Indicative Content

[20]

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be
acceptable.

•  The view expressed in Item 3 that Akbar’s rule was successful as it marked a period of religious tolerance has some credibility. As the item
states, he believed that all religions should be tolerated, and for potentially political reasons he married a Hindu princess. Hindus were
welcomed into the Mughal administration and army, which promoted individuals based on meritocracy.

•  Akbar removed the Jizya tax on non-Muslims, established the Ibadat Khana (House of Worship), where scholars from all religions were

•

invited to take part in religious debate, and developed the Din-i llahi (Divine Faith) which incorporated elements from a variety of religions.
Item 3 is an extract from a BBC website and therefore it will be an edited version of events. It is written for the public as opposed to being an
academic study, which limits its sophistication and content.

•  However, candidates may challenge the view by emphasising other factors. For example, Akbar’s rule was successful due to his court and
administration system. He centralised bureaucracy and introduced the mansabdari system, which promoted officials based on meritocracy.
He established a fair revenue system that ensured money for the empire and removed corruption.

•  Further, the success of Akbar’s rule was due to his military conquests. Akbar inherited a fragmented empire and annexed nearby territories,
making significant territorial gains in areas such as Gujarat, Bengal and Kashmir. By conquering these areas, Akbar removed potential
threats and increased the empire’s wealth. The Battle of Panipat in 1556 helped to establish Mughal control in India.

•  Candidates may argue that the statement is largely correct, and note the positive actions he took to foster religious tolerance within the
Empire, or they may argue that while religious tolerance was important, his rule was successful because of the reforms he implemented
and/or the expansion that he oversaw. It may also be argued that his ability to expand the empire, allied with his religious tolerance left the
Empire in a stronger position.
