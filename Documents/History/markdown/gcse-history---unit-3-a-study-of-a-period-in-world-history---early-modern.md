- This is a two-part question. Answer part (a) then part (b). Part (b) must be answered in continuous text.  **0 3**
  - **b)** Compare **and** contrast Item 1 and Item 2 as evidence for a historian studying Timbuktu during the Golden Age of Songhai in the sixteenth century**. [15]**

**a)** Describe the currency system in the Songhai Empire. **[5]**

#### **Item 1** Leo Africanus, a Spanish diplomat and author, writing in his book *The Cosmography and Geography of Africa* (1526). Africanus was born a Muslim but became a Christian and later wrote about his experiences travelling throughout western Africa.

The houses of Timbuktu are huts made of clay with thatched roofs. In the centre of Timbuktu is a mosque built of stone and there is a large palace where the king lives. The people who live in Timbuktu are very rich, especially the strangers who have settled in the country. The current king has given two of his daughters in marriage to two brothers, both businessmen, because of their wealth. There are many wells containing clean water in Timbuktu. When the River Niger floods water is delivered to the city. Grain and animals are plentiful, so there is a lot of milk and butter available.

#### **Item 2** Katie Amery and Teni Gogo, history teachers and authors, writing in their textbook for 11 to 13-year-olds, *African Kingdoms: West Africa* (2023)

By around 1450 Timbuktu was home to 100 000 people, twice as many as London at that time, and it continued to thrive as part of the Kingdom of Songhai. The city was at the centre of people's social life. Many houses were built of stone and there was a large public square where markets were held regularly. There was also at least one mosque: the Djinguereber Mosque built by Mansa Musa before the Songhai Kingdom was established.

- This is a two-part question. Answer part (a) then part (b). Part (b) must be answered in continuous text.  **0 4**
  - **a)** Describe the events of the Battle of Tondibi in 1591. **[5]**

**b)** Evaluate the view in **Item 3** that the Songhai Empire collapsed due to defeat by the Moroccans at the Battle of Tondibi in 1591. **[20]**

**Item 3**

An anonymous author, writing in the general interest book *The Songhai Empire* (2022). The book is part of the *Captivating History*  series, which claims to make history interesting, fun and useful.

The Battle of Tondibi was the final stand of the mighty Songhai. For most of the army and animals used in the battle, it was their first time experiencing muskets and cannons. The Songhai ruler offered the Moroccans gold and slaves to withdraw but they refused and marched on Gao, destroying it. … By April, the Moroccans headed for the trading centres of Djenne and Timbuktu with the aim of overrunning the kingdom. … The Moroccan army looted and ransacked the ancient trading towns and brought the Songhai Empire to ruin both economically and politically.

#### **Section B**

#### **3.4 The Mughal Empire c.1526–c.1707**

Describe the First Battle of Panipat, 1526. **[5]** Explain why Mughal art and architecture developed during the rule of Shah Jahan. **[10]** This is a two-part question.

Part (b) must be answered in continuous text. **(a)** Describe the resolution of family conflict by Aurangzeb. **[5] (b)** Compare **and** contrast Item 1 and Item 2 as evidence for a historian studying the impact of Aurangzeb's religious piety**. [15] 0 5 0 6 0 7**

### **Item 1**

Bakhtawar Khan, a historian and advisor to the emperor Aurangzeb, writing in his account of the political, social and cultural aspects of the Mughal Empire *Mir-at-i 'alam* [Mirror of the World] (seventeenth century)

Hindu writers have been entirely excluded from holding public offices, and all the worshipping places and great temples of these infidels [unbelievers] have been torn down and destroyed in a manner so successful it has astonished people that such a difficult task has been completed.

His Majesty (Aurangzeb) personally teaches the Muslim faith to non-Muslims with success, and all the mosques in the empire are repaired at public expense.

## **Item 2**

John Keay, a historian, journalist and presenter, writing in his general interest book *India: A history from the earliest civilizations to the boom of the twenty-first century* (2010)

Aurangzeb's supporters argue that Shah Jahan also discriminated against non-Muslims and targeted temples. Aurangzeb in fact destroyed few temples and to others he granted the ability to raise money. The sites which were damaged were chosen because they were a political or ideological threat … Even the jizya (the tax on non-Muslims) was not unreasonable and the poorest were exempt from payment. Further, it seems unlikely that the tax was collected at all in the remoter regions of the empire.

{7}------------------------------------------------

- This is a two-part question. Answer part (a) then part (b). Part (b) must be answered in continuous text.  **0 8**
  - **(a)** Describe the key principles of Akbar's divine faith. **[5]**

**(b)** Evaluate the view in **Item 3** that Akbar's rule was successful because it marked a period of religious tolerance. **[20]**

**Item 3**

An anonymous author writing in the information page "Mughal Empire (1500s, 1600s)" as part of the Religion section on the BBC website (2009)

Akbar worked hard to win over the hearts and minds of the Hindu leaders. While this may well have been for political reasons – he married a Hindu princess (and is said to have married several thousand wives for political and diplomatic purposes) – it was also a part of his philosophy.

Akbar believed that all religions should be tolerated, and that a ruler's duty was to treat all believers equally, whatever their belief.

#### **MARK SCHEME**

#### **Guidance for examiners**

#### **Generic marking principles**

- Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
- Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.
- Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
- Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

#### **Positive marking**

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising him/her for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates' answers. The list is not exhaustive. The inclusion of *'Credit any other valid response.*' (or similar instruction) within mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates' responses. Credit should be given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates' answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However, unless there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks where the answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

#### **Banded mark schemes**

For band-marked questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in candidates' answers. It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate's response. As noted above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive and candidates do not have to include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been provided, no marks should be awarded.

{9}------------------------------------------------

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each candidate's response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills, knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors or omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate's answer to pick out the evidence that is being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied. This is done as a two-stage process.

#### **Stage 1 – Deciding on the band**

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate's answer and check whether it matches the descriptors for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the descriptors match the answer.

If an answer covers different aspects of different bands within the mark scheme, a 'best fit' approach should be adopted to decide on the band and then the candidate's response should be used to decide on the mark within the band. For instance, if a response is mainly in band 2 but with a limited amount of band 3 content, the answer would be placed in band 2, but the mark awarded would be close to the top of band 2 as a result of the band 3 content.

Examiners should not seek to mark candidates down as a result of small omissions in minor areas of an answer.

#### **Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark**

During standardising (the marking conference), detailed advice from the Principal Examiner on the qualities of each mark band will be given. Examiners will then receive examples of answers in each mark band that have been awarded a mark by the Principal Examiner. Examiners should mark the examples and compare their marks with those of the Principal Examiner.

When marking, examiners can use these examples to decide whether a candidate's response is of a superior, inferior or comparable standard to the example. Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the answer as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the response provided.

| Describe the cultural practices of the Songhai people. |  | [5] |

#### **Indicative Content**

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- Music was important to the Songhai people with traditional instruments such as balafon (percussion), djembe (drum), goje (one string fiddle) and lutes being played. Storytelling was often done through song and was important to pass on culture and traditions through the lyrics.
- Songhai songs were often accompanied by traditional dances which they believed connected people with the spiritual world. They would be performed in communal gatherings and at special events such as weddings.
- They wore traditional clothes with flowing robes and tunics made from cotton that were dyed in vibrant colours. Men and women wore jewellery such as necklaces and bracelets made from gold, silver and beads. Specific patterns were used on clothes and these had significance, indicating, for example, tribal loyalty.

| Explain why Sonni Ali's military campaigns between 1468 and 1492 were important. |            | [10]           |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- Sonni Ali's campaigns expanded the Songhai territory and influence, making it one of the largest empires in West Africa. The conquest of Timbuktu in 1468 gave the Songhai Empire control of the trans-Saharan trade routes, which increased the Empire's wealth. By capturing cities such as Djenne, Sonni Ali elevated the Songhai Empire's political and cultural influence.
- The campaigns led to a strengthening of central authority. Trading with areas incorporated into the Empire brought economic growth and prosperity which required monitoring. The growing empire was divided into provinces that were overseen by governors or local chieftains who were loyal to Sonni Ali. These men ensured that taxes, resources and a workforce were gathered effectively, and they reported to Sonni Ali.
- Furthermore, campaigns provided the opportunity for Sonni Ali to strengthen the military and develop his tactics, including the use of a navy. Canoes were used to travel along the River Niger and launch surprise attacks. The cavalry was developed, which was important in the capture of Timbuktu and Djenne, to allow forces to move quickly. These military advances allowed Sonni Ali to launch further effective campaigns.

| Question 3(a) |  | Total marks |
|-----------------------------------------------------|--|----------------|
| Describe the currency system in the Songhai Empire. |  | [5]            |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- Cowry shells were a common form of currency in the Songhai Empire, especially for lowvalue transactions. They were accepted across large areas of West Africa making them easy and reliable to use. They were effective as they could be easily counted and exchanged for goods, such as textiles and food.
- For high-value transactions, gold and silver coins were used as currency. Coins were often minted in cities such as Goa and their value was based on their metal content and weight. The most commonly used coin was the dinar, which was widely accepted and allowed trade with other regions across Africa.
- A bartering system was used in local markets where goods such as salt and ivory were exchanged. In cities such as Timbuktu and Djenne, people traded goods such as food and crafts directly.

| Question 3(b) | Total marks |  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--|
| Compare and contrast Item 1 and Item 2 as evidence for a historian studying Timbuktu during the Golden Age of Songhai in the sixteenth century. | [15] |  |
| Item 1: Leo Africanus, a Spanish diplomat and author, writing in his book The Cosmography and Geography of Africa (1526). Africanus was born a Muslim but became a Christian and later wrote about his experiences travelling throughout western Africa. |  |  |
| The houses of Timbuktu are huts made of clay with thatched roofs. In the centre of Timbuktu is a mosque built of stone and there is a large palace where the king lives. The people who live in Timbuktu are very rich, especially the strangers who have settled in the country. The current king has given two of his daughters in marriage to two brothers, both businessmen, because of their wealth. There are many wells containing clean water in Timbuktu. When the River Niger floods, water is delivered to the city. Grain and animals are plentiful, so there is a lot of milk and butter available. |  |  |
| Item 2: Katie Amery and Teni Gogo, history teachers and authors, writing in their textbook for 11 to 13-year-olds, African Kingdoms: West Africa (2023) |  |  |
| By around 1450 Timbuktu was home to 100 000 people, twice as many as London at that time, and it continued to thrive as part of the Kingdom of Songhai. The city was at the centre of people's social life. Many houses were built of stone and there was a large public square where markets were held regularly. There was also at least one mosque: the Djinguereber Mosque built by Mansa Musa before the Songhai Kingdom was established. |  |  |

{15}------------------------------------------------

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

#### **Comparisons:**

- Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that Timbuktu was prosperous in the sixteenth century and that it was a thriving city.
- Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that there was a mosque at the centre of Timbuktu showing the importance of Islam to the people.
- Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that Timbuktu was a centre of trading. Item 1 states that there were many shops. Item 2 states that markets were held regularly in the public square.
- Both Item 1 and Item 2 show the importance of Timbuktu. Item 1 states that there was a palace where the king lived and Item 2 states that it had more inhabitants than London at this time.

#### **Contrasts:**

- Item 1 states that houses were huts made of clay with thatched rooves whereas Item 2 states many houses were made out of stone.
- Item 1 states that Timbuktu was prosperous due to its location near the River Niger and the availability of water, whereas Item 2 states that it was thriving as it was a part of the Songhai Empire.
- Item 1 states that there was a mosque at the centre of Timbuktu and implies that this was an achievement of the Songhai, whereas Item 2 states that the Djinguereber Mosque was built by Mansa Musa, prior to Songhai control of the city.
- Item 1 is a first-hand account and the personal opinion of Leo Africanus whereas Item 2 is from a textbook aimed at a younger audience and therefore may be simplified.

| Describe the events of the Battle of Tondibi in 1591. |  |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- The battle took place on 13 March 1591 between the Songhai, led by Askia Ishaq II, and the smaller Moroccan force, led by Judar Pasha.
- The Moroccans set up a fortified position and used their artillery to bombard the Songhai troops, leading to them fleeing the field or being massacred by enemy fire. The Moroccans had superior weaponry such as firearms and cannons, but the Songhai used traditional weapons such as spears and were reliant on the cavalry, which put them at a disadvantage.
- The Moroccans won the battle swiftly and there were significant Songhai casualties, showing that their battle techniques were outdated. The Battle of Tondibi highlighted the weaknesses of the Songhai Empire.

| Evaluate the view in Item 3 that the Songhai Empire collapsed due to defeat by the Moroccans at the Battle of Tondibi in 1591. | [20] |
| Item 3: An anonymous author, writing in the general interest book The Songhai Empire (2022). The book is part of the Captivating History series, which claims to make history interesting, fun and useful. |  |
| The Battle of Tondibi was the final stand of the mighty Songhai. For most of the army and animals used in the battle, it was their first time experiencing muskets and cannons. The Songhai ruler offered the Moroccans gold and slaves to withdraw but they refused and marched on Gao, destroying it By April, the Moroccans headed for the trading centres of Djenne and Timbuktu with the aim of overrunning the kingdom The Moroccan army looted and ransacked the ancient trading towns and brought the Songhai Empire to ruin both economically and politically. |  |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- The view expressed in Item 3, that the Songhai Empire collapsed due to the defeat at the Battle of Tondibi, has some credibility. The Moroccan forces utilised their superior firearms and cannons during the battle, which decimated the Songhai forces. This destroyed Songhai confidence. Failed peace negotiations led to further Moroccan expansion.
- Following the success at Tondibi, the Moroccan capture of Goa and Timbuktu weakened the Empire's ability to govern and caused instability within the empire. The Moroccan attacks disrupted the trans-Saharan trade routes, which had an impact on the economic stability of the Empire. Following this, the Songhai Empire fragmented, splitting into rival states, and never recovered.
- Item 3 is from a general interest book which states its aim is to make history fun and therefore it may be simplified. As the author is unknown, it is difficult to assess the level of their expertise in the history of the Songhai Empire, which limits its reliability.
- Candidates may challenge the view by emphasising other factors. For example,they may argue that economic and environmental factors were responsible for the collapse of the Songhai Empire. Drought caused crop failure, reduced food supplies and caused famine, which weakened internal stability causing subsequent social unrest. The decline of the major trade routes reduced the flow of valuable goods, such as salt and slaves, which were crucial to the economic stability of the Empire.
- Further, leadership and succession problems led to the collapse of the Songhai Empire. When Askia Daoud died in 1582, there was no clear succession plan leading to disputes amongst his descendants. Various rival claimants fought for control, weakening central authority and causing instability. Successive rulers after Askia Daoud were weak and ineffective, which led to rebellions in parts of the Empire.

{20}------------------------------------------------

• Candidates may ultimately judge that Tondibi was the main factor that led to the collapse of the Songhai Empire, they may argue that other factors were more significant and fatally weakened the Empire before the Moroccan invasion, or they may judge that those factors impaired the Empire badly and the Battle of Tondibi was the final straw.

| Describe the First Battle of Panipat, 1526. |  |

#### **Indicative Content**

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- The battle was fought between Babur and the Sultan of Delhi, who had a larger number of men. Despite this, Babur's forces used new weapons such as muskets and cannons, which gave him the advantage.
- Babur used innovative military tactics such as dividing his army into smaller mobile groups. He placed his cannons behind a fortified line of carts, which also protected his army but had gaps to allow his cavalry to attack.
- The Mughal cavalry attacked the Sultan's forces from the rear whilst flanks of his army advanced, resulting in Babur winning the battle.

| Explain why Mughal art and architecture developed during the rule of Shah Jahan. |                |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- Shah Jahan enjoyed dancing and music and was a patron of literature and learning. He instructed that works of mathematics and astronomy written in Sanskrit be translated to Persian showing his desire to encourage learning. His reign is considered to be a golden age of cultural development as he attracted poets, scholars and intellectuals from around the world to contribute to his cultural legacy.
- During Shah Jahan's rule, the Mughal Empire underwent significant economic growth that provided the resources for architectural projects. He had an appreciation for gardens and water features, the use of marble, flower motifs and geometric patterns, which were incorporated into many architectural projects with the aim of creating a paradise on earth. Shah Jahan created the Red Fort in Delhi to be an example of Mughal architecture, incorporating red sandstone walls, marble palaces and ornate gateways. This was used as the main residence of Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years, further demonstrating his architectural legacy. The Taj Mahal was built as a tomb for his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It was opulent and visible to all, indicating his desire to leave an architectural legacy while also demonstrating his wealth and power.
- Furthermore, there was religious motivation. He commissioned the construction of the Jama Masjid, one of the largest mosques in India, with the aim of being a place for worship, but also becoming an example of architectural marvel.

| Describe the resolution of family conflict by Aurangzeb. |                |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- Aurangzeb dealt with family conflict by removing the people that opposed him and assuming total control.
- Aurangzeb eliminated the threat of his brothers as they each had a claim to the throne. He defeated his eldest brother Dara Shikoh at the Battle of Samugarh in 1658. Shikoh was subsequently executed in 1659. Aurangzeb also defeated Shah Shuja and Marus Baksh, solidifying his claim to the throne.
- To consolidate his power, Aurangzeb imprisoned his father, Shah Jahan, in the Agra Fort. He spent the end of his life there living under house arrest, unable to have any influence over the rule of the empire or the opportunity to disagree with Aurangzeb.

| Compare and contrast Item 1 and Item 2 as evidence for a historian studying the impact of Aurangzeb's religious piety. | [15] |
| Item 1: Bakhtawar Khan, a historian and advisor to the emperor Aurangzeb, writing in his account of the political, social and cultural aspects of the Mughal Empire Mir-at-i 'alam [Mirror of the World] (seventeenth century) |  |
| Hindu writers have been entirely excluded from holding public offices, and all the worshipping places and great temples of these infidels [unbelievers] have been torn down and destroyed in a manner so successful it has astonished people that such a difficult task has been completed. |  |
| His Majesty (Aurangzeb) personally teaches the Muslim faith to non-Muslims with success, and all the mosques in the empire are repaired at public expense. |  |
| Item 2: John Keay, a historian, journalist and presenter, writing in his general interest book India: A history from the earliest civilizations to the boom of the twenty-first century (2010) |  |
| Aurangzeb's supporters argue that Shah Jahan also discriminated against non-Muslims and targeted temples. Aurangzeb in fact destroyed few temples and to others he granted the ability to raise money. The sites which were damaged were chosen because they were a political or ideological threat … Even the jizya (the tax on non-Muslims) was not unreasonable and the poorest were exempt from payment. Further, it seems unlikely that the tax was collected at all in the remoter regions of the empire. |  |

{26}------------------------------------------------

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

#### **Comparisons:**

- Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that Hindus and non-Muslims faced discrimination.
- Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that Hindu temples were destroyed during Aurangzeb's rule.
- Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that Aurangzeb promoted Islam.
- Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that there was religious and political motivation to the persecution of the Hindus.

#### **Contrasts:**

- Item 1 states that Aurangzeb treated Hindus unfairly, for example not allowing them to hold public positions, whereas Item 2 states Aurangzeb was reasonable and did not treat Hindus any worse than other Mughal rulers, for example Shah Jahan.
- Item 1 suggests that Aurangzeb's achievements (destruction of temples) were impressive given the difficulties of the task, whereas Item 2 suggests that Aurangzeb only damaged religious sites that were seen to be a threat and, in fact, few temples were destroyed.
- Item 1 states that Aurangzeb successfully taught Islam to non-Muslims, whereas Item 2 focuses more on him treating non-Muslims fairly.
- Item 1 is a focused history on Aurangzeb written by a contemporary advisor in praise of Aurangzeb's achievements, whereas Item 2 is a more objective account from a much broader book on Indian History written in the twenty-first century.

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- Akbar was the spiritual leader of his divine faith (Din-i Ilahi), which promoted unity and religious tolerance. He encouraged the blending of different religious beliefs, including Islam, Hinduism and Christianity, in order to have peace across the empire.
- The divine faith promoted people leading a pious lifestyle and a focus on moral principles. Akbar believed that loyalty, honesty and respect were key virtues.
- There was the adoption of unique practices such as sun worship, and traditional Islamic practices, such as pilgrimage, were discouraged.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Evaluate the view in Item 3 that Akbar's rule was successful because it marked a period of religious tolerance. | [20] |
| Item 3:An anonymous author writing in the information page "Mughal Empire (1500s, 1600s)" as part of the Religion section on the BBC website (2009) |  |
| Akbar worked hard to win over the hearts and minds of the Hindu leaders. While this may well have been for political reasons – he married a Hindu princess (and is said to have married several thousand wives for political and diplomatic purposes) – it was also a part of his philosophy. |  |
| Akbar believed that all religions should be tolerated, and that a ruler's duty was to treat all believers equally, whatever their belief.                                                                                                                                                                 |                |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- The view expressed in Item 3 that Akbar's rule was successful as it marked a period of religious tolerance has some credibility. As the item states, he believed that all religions should be tolerated, and for potentially political reasons he married a Hindu princess. Hindus were welcomed into the Mughal administration and army, which promoted individuals based on meritocracy.
- Akbar removed the Jizya tax on non-Muslims, established the Ibadat Khana (House of Worship), where scholars from all religions were invited to take part in religious debate, and developed the Din-i llahi (Divine Faith) which incorporated elements from a variety of religions.
- Item 3 is an extract from a BBC website and therefore it will be an edited version of events. It is written for the public as opposed to being an academic study, which limits its sophistication and content.
- However, candidates may challenge the view by emphasising other factors. For example, Akbar's rule was successful due to his court and administration system. He centralised bureaucracy and introduced the mansabdari system, which promoted officials based on meritocracy. He established a fair revenue system that ensured money for the empire and removed corruption.
- Further, the success of Akbar's rule was due to his military conquests. Akbar inherited a fragmented empire and annexed nearby territories, making significant territorial gains in areas such as Gujarat, Bengal and Kashmir. By conquering these areas, Akbar removed potential threats and increased the empire's wealth. The Battle of Panipat in 1556 helped to establish Mughal control in India.
- Candidates may argue that the statement is largely correct, and note the positive actions he took to foster religious tolerance within the Empire, or they may argue that while religious tolerance was important, his rule was successful because of the reforms he implemented and/or the expansion that he oversaw. It may also be argued that his ability to expand the empire, allied with his religious tolerance left the Empire in a stronger position.
