The flooding of the Welsh-speaking village of Capel Celyn to create a reservoir to provide water for Liverpool is a vital event in modern Welsh history. There was anger that Welshspeaking residents would be moved out and natural resources were being taken away from Wales. There were appeals to Liverpool city council to save the village, but they were not enough to get plans dropped.

In June, violence erupted in Newport in Wales. Black men's lodgings and black families' homes were attacked and ransacked. Racial violence next exploded in the Welsh port of Barry, and by 11 June it had spread to Tiger Bay in Cardiff. The riots in Cardiff lasted a week and cost three men their lives. Huge gangs patrolled the streets on the hunt for black men.

The crowd of rioters moved to Herbert Street in Cardiff Bay where information had been passed around concerning a house occupied by several black men. There was no hesitation. The crowd attacked the house immediately, breaking the windows and forcing an entrance to the building. The interior was completely wrecked and the furniture was thrown into the road.

# **MARK SCHEME**

#### **Guidance for examiners**

#### **Generic marking principles**

- Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
- Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.
- Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
- Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

#### **Positive marking**

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising him/her for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points based, the mark scheme should be applied precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates' answers. The list is not exhaustive. The inclusion of *'Credit any other valid response.*' (or similar instruction) within mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates' responses. Credit should be given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates' answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However, unless there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks where the answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

#### **Banded mark schemes**

For band-marked questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in candidates' answers. It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate's response. As noted above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive and candidates do not have to include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been provided, no marks should be awarded.

{12}------------------------------------------------

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each candidate's response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills, knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors or omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate's answer to pick out the evidence that is being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied. This is done as a two-stage process.

#### **Stage 1 – Deciding on the band**

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate's answer and check whether it matches the descriptors for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the descriptors match the answer.

If an answer covers different aspects of different bands within the mark scheme, a 'best fit' approach should be adopted to decide on the band and then the candidate's response should be used to decide on the mark within the band. For instance, if a response is mainly in band 2 but with a limited amount of band 3 content, the answer would be placed in band 2, but the mark awarded would be close to the top of band 2 as a result of the band 3 content.

Examiners should not seek to mark candidates down as a result of small omissions in minor areas of an answer.

#### **Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark**

During standardising (the marking conference), detailed advice from the Principal Examiner on the qualities of each mark band will be given. Examiners will then receive examples of answers in each mark band that have been awarded a mark by the Principal Examiner. Examiners should mark the examples and compare their marks with those of the Principal Examiner.

When marking, examiners can use these examples to decide whether a candidate's response is of a superior, inferior or comparable standard to the example. Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the answer as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the response provided.

|-----------------------------------------|--|----------------|
| Explain why the Rebecca Riots occurred. |  | [10]           |

- The immediate cause of the Rebecca Riots was opposition to the charges on toll roads in South Wales that farmers were forced to pay to be able to transport their livestock and produce to market. Farming smallholdings in this period were marginal so the additional cost of tolls made it almost impossible for farmers who owned or rented small farms to make any money. This was why their anger was directed towards attacking the toll gates.
- Driving this anger was the desperation to avoid living in poverty in this period. The 1834 Poor Law meant that people who became too poor to support themselves or their families would have to live in the harsh conditions of a workhouse. Population growth across Wales had already led to more competition for land and jobs, which is why it was so important for farmers to make the money they would need to avoid losing their farms and their livelihoods.
- Resentment towards the wealthy, Anglican, English-speaking landlords was also an important reason for the riots. It was these landlords who set the tolls on the roads and who were pressuring farmers of smallholdings to give up their smallholdings so they could make, rent or sell larger and more profitable farms. It was also these landlords who set the tithes that the Welsh nonconformists were forced to pay to the Church of England.

| Describe the protests that took place during<br>the Merthyr Rising. | [5]            |

- Thousands of workers met at Waun Common above Dowlais on 30 May 1831 to demand the overturning of the wage cuts imposed by the Crawshays a week earlier.
- The following day a crowd of workers gathered to prevent bailiffs taking property from the house of Lewis Lewis, although they managed to take his trunk. They helped Lewis get his property back from the bailiffs. This crowd then went further, visiting other houses in Merthyr, to find and return property taken by the bailiffs. This led to the harassing of bailiffs, moneylenders and other officials who worked for the Court of Requests.
- Attempts by the authorities to regain control resulted in a more violent response from the protesters. When troops from Brecon arrived, a fight broke out in which 20 protesters were killed and one soldier was injured. Rioters ambushed troops coming from Neath and stopped an ammunition convoy coming from Brecon.

| The Merthyr Rising of 1831 was the violent climax to many years of angry unrest among the working-class population of Merthyr Tydfil and the surrounding area. The Rising marked the first time the red flag was used as a symbol of working-class protest in the United Kingdom. |                |

- The item is valuable to an understanding of the events of the Merthyr Rising as it describes the rising as a violent event involving the working-class people of Merthyr Tydfil. However, its value is limited as it does not say anything about what had inspired this violence, or that violence was in response to troops being deployed to quell the protest.
- The item also has value as it states that the use of the red flag as part of this protest led to it becoming the symbol of working-class protest in the UK. But this too is undermined by the lack of explanation about the grievances of the protesters, that that their anger was directed at the bailiffs and the Court of Requests who had deprived other members of the community of their property in lieu of their debts, rather than it being directed at the government.
- The information that this item which is an interpretation includes is probably accurate as it will be based on research, although the anonymity of its author means that we cannot be sure how they have arrived at this information, or whether they will have had the experience to interpret information correctly.
- It may also be suggested that the interpretation's value is enhanced by how long after the described events it has been written, allowing for the most up-to-date research to be included. On the other hand, the views expressed might be undermined by it being an internet site in the public domain which could be edited by anyone.
- Overall, it could be suggested that the item is valuable in that it provides a brief overview of the events of the Merthyr Rising, although it does not attempt to explain the background to the rising. Or it may be argued to be limiting factors like the anonymity of its author or authors writing in the public domain that makes it less, rather than more valuable to our understanding of this issue.

| Outline the short-term failures of<br>Chartism. |  | [5]            |

- All three of the Chartist petitions (1839, 1842 and 1848) were rejected by MPs at the time. No laws were passed in the short term as a result of these petitions in regard to the franchise, the introduction of a more equal political system, or the removal of the limitations on who could become an MP.
- Chartism became divided between supporters of two different methods of achieving its aims – the 'moral force' Chartists who wanted to use persuasive methods like the petition and speeches to convince politicians, and the 'physical force' Chartists who wanted to use violence to achieve their aims.
- While there was a lot of support for Chartism amongst the working class, the middle class were increasingly won over to the side of the existing political system which is why they increasingly helped to limit Chartist marches.

## Question 4b Total Marks To what extent do Item 2 and Item 3 persuade you that the Newport Rising was a threat to the government? Item 2: Kenneth Budd, an English artist, depicts the Newport Rising in his mural The Chartist Mural (created in 1978), which used to be sited in Newport city centre. The banner states "300 constituencies of equal numbers of electors". Item 3: Sir John Campbell, prosecuting, explains his view on the Newport Rising to the jury, in a transcript of the official records of the trial of John Frost in Monmouth (1839) [20]

Arriving at Newport, the Chartists aimed to attack the troops that were there. They wanted to take control of the town. This was not a

meeting to petition the Queen or Parliament. Their objective was to use armed force to change the law of this country.

{21}------------------------------------------------

- The items are persuasive because both suggest that the Newport Rising was a threat to the government. Item 2 refers to the violence between the Chartists carrying weapons on the left-hand side of the picture to the soldiers firing on them on the right-hand side of the picture. This is also highlighted in Item 3, which shows that the Chartists aimed to use force to take over Newport with the aim of forcing the government to change the laws about voting.
- However, more persuasive is the idea that the Newport Rising was a last act of desperation for people who wanted the government to save them from the starvation and poverty that the ironmasters had left them living in, rather than a direct challenge to how the country was governed.
- Item 2, which is a modern interpretation, would be able to offer an overview of the period. It may be argued to offer a credible description of the climax of the rising in the centre of Newport, with the caveat that, as it is from a public mural created by an artist to commemorate the event, it seems to take a sympathetic view of the Chartist protesters. Regardless, the artist Kenneth Budd would have had to do research to form his interpretation to persuade the local authorities that his view of events was correct before they allowed him to put it in a public place.
- Item 3, on the other hand, is a contemporary source, and the argument that the Newport Rising was a threat to the government is lent credence by the suggestion that the Chartists were arrested in the middle of their violent insurrection to take control of Newport. However, it will likely be noted that this is very limited in its coverage of the rising, with no sense of the events that led up to this scene, or its consequences.
- Overall, the items are persuasive that the Newport Rising was a threat to the government, as they indicate that the Chartists had violence in mind when they marched on Newport, even though there is no explanation here as to what had inspired this. It will likely be concluded that bringing weapons into Newport to force the authorities to listen to their demands was a very serious threat to the government.

| Explain why there were changes in leisure opportunities in Wales in the 1950s. | [10]           |

- One of the main reasons for changes in leisure opportunities in this period was that people increasingly had both the time and the money to invest in leisure opportunities. Workers in the 1950s were being paid higher wages and working fewer hours than they would have had done before the Second World War. This gave them more time and more money to spend on leisure activities. The growth of affluence and consumerism in the 1950s made the prices of leisure goods and services more affordable to people in regular work.
- Technological developments also led to changes in leisure opportunities. With the development of jukeboxes and record players, along with new portable devices like the transistor radio or the dansette, it was easier to listen to music on the radio or in the form of vinyl records. At the same time, the expanding television service and more affordable television sets brought a wide range of programming into the living rooms of ordinary people.
- Opportunities for tourism had also increased. Developments in travel and transport such as the motor car and aeroplanes opened up more opportunities for tourism within and beyond Wales in this period. The tourism industry had responded to this by encouraging people to visit seaside towns and heritage sites during their leisure time. Holiday camps from the 1930s and national parks from the 1950s also offered desirable locations for people to visit in Wales and the UK.

| Outline increasing support for Plaid<br>Cymru in the 1950s. |  | [5]            |

- There was increasing concern about a decline in the number of people speaking Welsh and a lack of recognition of the Welsh language officially, which led to increasing support for the party. Plaid Cymru had been campaigning about this issue since the 1920s but by the 1950s the decline was sharper than ever.
- By the 1950s, Plaid Cymru, the Welsh political party, was campaigning to get MPs elected to the UK Parliament and onto local councils to have more political influence for the people of Wales, adding to its earlier focus on Welsh cultural issues.
- There were a lot of issues affecting the people of Wales in this period, ranging from the closing down of coal mines to the flooding of the Tryweryn Valley to provide water for Liverpool. Many Welsh people felt that the traditional political parties like Labour and the Conservatives were not listening to their concerns over these issues and wanted a party that would listen.

| How valuable is Item 1 to our understanding of the influence of Welsh nationalism in the 1950s?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [15]           |
| Item 1: David Williamson, a political journalist, writing in the article "The Story of the outrage that has shaped Welsh politics for more than five decades" on the Welsh news website Wales Online (2016)                                                                                                                                                                                        |                |
| The flooding of the Welsh-speaking village of Capel Celyn to create a reservoir to provide water for Liverpool is a vital event in modern Welsh history. There was anger that Welsh-speaking residents would be moved out and natural resources were being taken away from Wales. There were appeals to Liverpool city council to save the village, but they were not enough to get plans dropped. |                |

- The item is valuable to an understanding of the influence of Welsh nationalism in the 1950s as it explains that the flooding of Capel Celyn to make a reservoir for Liverpool had created a lot of anger at the English exploitation of Welsh resources and its lack of care for Welsh-speaking communities. However, its value is limited as it only focuses on one very high-profile example which only affected a small number of households in the Tryweryn Valley. It also does not explain what the outcome of this appeal was.
- The item also has value in that it states that there was anger about a Welsh-speaking community and natural resources from Wales being sacrificed to provided water to a city in England for free. But there is a lack of consideration of the extent of support for the Welsh nationalists for their opposition to this, or how the influence of Welsh nationalism changed over time.
- The information that this item which is an interpretation includes is accurate, as the journalist David Williamson who wrote it will have done research into this topic to produce his article. Not only would the proposed law and the meetings of Liverpool City Council have produced written evidence of what was being proposed, but the activities of the protesters and interviews with those involved would also have been considered in writing this article.
- It may also be suggested that the interpretation's value is enhanced by the significance of the amount of information that would have been available to David Williamson as the article was being written sixty years after the events being described. On the other hand, the views expressed might be undermined by the article being written from the point of view of the Welsh nationalist protesters as is suggested by the word "outrage" in the title of the article.
- Overall, it could be suggested that the item is valuable in that it provides information about the response of the people of Capel Celyn, and their nationalist supporters, to the proposals to destroy a Welsh-speaking community in Wales to provide water for Liverpool. Or it

may be argued to be limiting factors, such as this being written from the point of view of the protesters, that make it less, rather than more, valuable to our understanding of this issue.

| Describe<br>the response of the authorities to the 1919 South Wales Race Riots. |  | [5]            |

- The police response was initially very slow as they were overwhelmed by the scale of the violence. As the riots progressed, they made more and more arrests, although a disproportionate number of those arrested were from the ethnic minority population rather than the white Welsh population. The police were so overwhelmed at times that troops were sent in to help them.
- Many black and Asian immigrants were arrested and put on trial accused of carrying weapons and attacking the local white population even though they were the victims of violence rather than the instigators of it. The few white people prosecuted were found guilty of much more minor offences.
- The government's Colonial Office and the Board of Trade began a repatriation scheme to encourage immigrants to return to where they had come from. There were financial incentives, and many people were pressured to leave as a result of this scheme. The 1920s Aliens Order, added to the 1919 Immigration Act, made it much more difficult for immigrants to work or settle in the UK.

| To what extent do Item 2 and Item 3 persuade you that racial tensions were significant in South Wales in 1919?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [20]           |
| Item 2 Adapted from the history book <i>Black and British – A Forgotten History</i> by historian and television broadcaster David Olusoga (2016)                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                |
| In June, violence erupted in Newport in Wales. Black men's lodgings and black families' homes were attacked and ransacked. Racial violence next exploded in the Welsh port of Barry, and by 11 June it had spread to Tiger Bay in Cardiff. The riots in Cardiff lasted a week and cost three men their lives. Huge gangs patrolled the streets on the hunt for black men. |                |
| Item 3 A report in the Wales-based newspaper <i>The Western Mail</i> (12 June 1919)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                |
| The crowd of rioters moved to Herbert Street in Cardiff Bay where information had been passed around concerning a house occupied by several black men. There was no hesitation. The crowd attacked the house immediately, breaking the windows and forcing an entrance to the building. The interior was completely wrecked and the furniture was thrown into the road.   |                |

- The items are persuasive because both suggest that racial tensions in South Wales were significant in 1919. Item 2 refers to attacks on the homes of black people in Newport, which then spread to Barry and Cardiff and would eventually last for a week. This is also highlighted in Item 3, which shows the details of one of these attacks happening on a house where several black men lived.
- However, more persuasive is the idea that it was not just the racial violence of these attacks themselves, but also the police and courts blaming the violence on the black men and their families, making out that the victims were actually guilty of crimes, that was significant about these racial tensions. There is also nothing in these items about the causes of these tensions, especially their timing, as men were being demobilised after the First World War.
- Item 2, which is a modern interpretation, would be able to offer an overview of the period. Written by a historian, it may be argued to offer a credible analysis of racial tensions, with the caveat that as it is from a general history book about the lives of black British people, covering a long period of time, it would necessarily only offer an overview of this issue in this period rather than an in-depth study. Regardless, as it is from a history book that focuses on black British history, the author will understand the context of these racial tensions in terms of their causes, what happened, and their consequences.

{31}------------------------------------------------

- Item 3, on the other hand, is a contemporary source, and the argument that racial tensions in 1919 were significant is lent credence by the suggestion that violence was specifically directed at the houses in Cardiff where black men were living. However, it will likely be noted that although the journalist who wrote this report may have just been describing what they saw, there is no indication as to how aware they were of the circumstances that had led to the outbreaks of violence. It may also be noted that, as this is from a contemporary newspaper based in Wales, it may have sensationalised the story to interest its readers. Item 3 can only provide a partial account of the effects of racial tensions in South Wales as it only focuses on one incident in one place.
- Overall, the items are persuasive that racial tensions in South Wales were significant in 1919, as they indicate the extreme levels of violence that immigrants in Cardiff and Newport faced in these race riots. It will likely be concluded that they were the result of on-going racial tensions and resulted in very poor treatment of the immigrants who were the victims of this violence.
