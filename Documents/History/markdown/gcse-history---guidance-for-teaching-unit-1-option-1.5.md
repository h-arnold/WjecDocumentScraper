## Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE History consists of four units. The combination of options selected for Units 1, 2 and 3 must include one medieval, one early modern and one modern unit.

In Unit 4, centres can choose to repeat a time period previously studied in Units 1, 2 or 3. However, the topics chosen for study in Unit 4 must not replicate or overlap with the content of any of the other selected units.

The qualification is unitised and does not contain tiering. There is no hierarchy to the order the units should be taught.

| Outcome: Learners can demonstrate an understanding of the roles of the commissioners and the lack of suitability for the roles they had including methods they used to question children. Advanced activity: Discussion: Do you think the commissioners found what they wanted to find? Given the emotive nature of this subject, is it possible to reach an objective view? Advanced outcome: Learners can demonstrate an understanding of how prejudice and personal feeling can hinder objectivity.   | Video(s): What did Charles have hidden in his crown? | Al Murray: Why Does Everyone Hate The English?

| • The reasons for the Tithe War in Northeast Wales, including: • the burden on tenants of paying tithes, the power of the landlords and the threat of evictions • the fall in prices for livestock in the 1880s | The causes of agricultural depression after 1873. The reasons for the fall in the prices of livestock. The background to tithes. How the tithes were an additional burden on tenant farmers. | Activity: Use Lowe Mastering Modern British History to explain 'Why and with what results was there a depression in agriculture after 1873?' In groups, read the Wikipedia article Great depression of British agriculture and then: Either : look at the maps from Where was the Great Agricultural Depression? Work out what is meant in the key to each map and summarise your findings. Or . look at Table 1 from Livestock prices in Britain and draw a chart showing the fluctuations in the prices of wool, ewes and store cattle. Discuss: how significant was agricultural failure in the later nineteenth century? What do you think the impact was on agricultural communities? Use the Britannica article to prepare a timeline of the history of tithes (NB: Wales is covered by England in this article).

## Cross-curricular Skills - Numeracy

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learning that statistics represent data, and that probability models chance, help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

## Examples

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

## Examples

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

| Creativity and Innovation             | There are many opportunities to include Creativity and Innovation in GCSE History. These opportunities are important to learners to become more engaged in lessons and enjoy learning through stimulating tasks. Deeper understanding is developed through the encouragement for learners to take an active role in their learning. Examples • Learners will demonstrate creativity when developing responses, expressing their opinions about relevant historical issues and critically evaluating sources and evidence within assessments. • Learners have opportunities to be creative and innovative when presenting information and findings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Critical Thinking and Problem Solving | There are many opportunities to include critical thinking and problem solving in GCSE History. These opportunities are important to learners because they develop the ability to think analytically, and to collect, reflect and critically evaluate evidence in order to make informed judgements on a range of topics. This skill can be applied to real-life scenarios. Examples • Learners will have opportunities to ask meaningful questions of source material and historical interpretations, as well as to evaluate them as part of their process of developing relevant critical arguments. • Learners will develop their ability to see issues from multiple viewpoints. • Studying continuity and change over time allows learners to develop their problem-solving skills that can be applied in their future lives. • Learners will evaluate sources and historical interpretations in terms of reliability, bias and purpose. • Critical thinking and problem solving encourages independent learning and promotes the ability to come to reasoned and informed decisions in other aspects of life such as further education or work. |
| Planning and Organisation             | There are many opportunities to include Planning and Organisation in GCSE History. These opportunities are important to Learners because these integral skills allow Learners to engage with the past, analyse information and communicate their findings which allow Learners to enhance their academic understanding and prepare them to apply historical knowledge in modern contexts. Below are some examples of how Planning and Organisation can be embedded into teaching and learning of GCSE History. Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
