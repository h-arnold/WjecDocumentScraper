**80 marks**

Learners will undertake a study of themed events within a continuous period of c.75–c.100 years of history. The events studied must be from the islands of Great Britain and/or Ireland.

For the assignment, learners will undertake a historical enquiry, providing an understanding of change across the period.

The topics chosen for non-examination assessment must not replicate or overlap with the content of any of the examined units chosen.

{7}------------------------------------------------

This is a unitised qualification.

The combination of options selected for Units 1, 2 and 3 must include one medieval, one early modern and one modern unit.

In Unit 4, centres can choose to repeat a time period previously studied in Units 1, 2 or 3. **However, the topics chosen for study in Unit 4 must not replicate or overlap with the content of any of the other selected units.**

It would be most appropriate for learners to complete Unit 4 in the final year of the course as they revisit a time period previously studied in one of the earlier units. This would allow learners to implement their understanding of historical concepts and the analysis and evaluation skills they have developed throughout Units 1 and 3. It would also allow learners to build on the approaches and practices developed when undertaking a historical enquiry in Unit 2.

There is no hierarchy implied by the order in which Units 1 to 3 are presented. Therefore, the order does not imply a prescribed teaching order.

The examinations for Units 1 and 3, and the submission of Unit 2 will be available for the first time in summer 2027. The submission of Unit 4 will be available for the first time in summer 2028. Each assessment will then be available every summer series.

The qualification will be awarded for the first time in summer 2028.

# GCSE HISTORY

# <span id="page-8-0"></span>1. INTRODUCTION

# <span id="page-8-1"></span>1.1 Aims

GCSE History qualification supports Learners to:

- develop their knowledge and understanding of specific historical events, periods and societies on a local, national and global scale
- extend their understanding and appreciation of the identity, heritage and history of Wales and the world and to develop a sense of cynefin
- become independent, critical and reflective historians through the skills of historical enquiry, questioning, and source analysis and evaluation
- construct valid and realistic historical claims by using a range of sources in context to reach substantiated judgements
- demonstrate critical appreciation of the concept of historical significance, including:
  - why some people, events and developments are seen as historically significant
  - why different interpretations have been constructed about historically significant people, events and developments
- acquire an understanding of different identities, including their own, within a complex, pluralistic and diverse society.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales' Approval Criteria.

# <span id="page-8-2"></span>1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE History qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of what](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/statements-of-what-matters/)  [matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/statements-of-what-matters/) and those [subject specific skills and concepts](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area) outlined in the '[Designing your](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/designing-your-curriculum/)  [Curriculum](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/designing-your-curriculum/)' section of the Humanities Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted on page 54; the Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery. 

{9}------------------------------------------------

The GCSE History qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:

- supporting the statements of what matters[1](#page-9-0) by giving learners the opportunity to:
  - gain a deeper understanding of the concepts underpinning humanities, and their application in local, national and global contexts
  - gather, justify, present, analyse, and evaluate a range of evidence
  - draw informed conclusions, but also understand that some conclusions can only be partial or inconclusive and open to different interpretations
  - critically review the ways events and experiences are perceived, interpreted and represented
  - learn how various worldviews and factors can influence their own and others' perceptions and interpretations, exploring how and why interpretations may differ
  - develop an appreciation of identity, heritage and cynefin, including the history of Wales and the World
  - develop an understanding of the complex, pluralistic and diverse nature of societies, past and present, in particular the stories of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic people
  - build an understanding of the causes, consequences and significance of the changes and interrelationships that have shaped societies at different levels of development
  - understand how societies are and have been organised, structured and led in learners' own localities and in Wales, as well as in the wider world
  - explore the connections and interdependence between such societies in the past and present, in the context of a globalised world
  - understand the interconnected nature of economic, environmental and social sustainability, justice and authority, and the need to live in and contribute to a fair and inclusive society that confronts and addresses racism
  - critically reflect on their own and others' beliefs, values and attitudes
  - consider the impact of their actions when making choices and exercising their democratic rights and responsibilities
  - justify their decisions.
- supporting the principles of progression[2](#page-9-1) by encouraging learners to:
  - ask increasingly sophisticated enquiry questions
  - find suitable information, making informed predictions and hypotheses, and making judgments about reliability and utility
  - engage with an increasing breadth and depth of knowledge and underlying concepts to build an increasingly clear and coherent understanding of the world around them
  - work with an increasing number and sophistication of sources of information, and a growing understanding of how to resolve contradictory or conflicting accounts
  - transfer existing skills and knowledge into new, and increasingly unfamiliar contexts, making links within and between periods and places, identifying similarities and differences, changes and continuities
  - identify connections between new and previous learning with greater understanding of the world, of other people and their values, in different times, places and circumstances.

<span id="page-9-1"></span><sup>2</sup> <https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/principles-of-progression/>

{10}------------------------------------------------

The construct of GCSE History qualification is based on the Welsh Government subject specific considerations for History[3](#page-10-2) . The qualification:

- provides opportunities to understand different periods, events, people and cultures in history, exploring these at a local, national and global scale
- provides opportunities to understand the significance of people, events and developments in history and how these can be interpreted in different ways: in different places and at different times
- equips learners with the skills to understand, interpret and evaluate historical evidence in order to make informed judgements
- equips learners with the skills to make sense of their place and the place of others within the framework of human experience
- provides opportunities to develop curiosity and empathy as well as the ability to filter and critically analyse the breadth of information available to us, to make informed and balanced judgements that foster a sense of cynefin and one's place in the world.

The GCSE History qualification is also based on the following historical concepts listed within the Approval Criteria:

- continuity and change
- similarity and difference
- significance and impact
- cause and consequence.

Each of these concepts support the Welsh Government's 'designing your curriculum' guidance as well as those within the statements of what matters and progression steps for Humanities.

# <span id="page-10-0"></span>1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3–14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of History at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

# <span id="page-10-1"></span>1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE History has been designed to be delivered within 120–140 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

<span id="page-10-2"></span><sup>©</sup> WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2024 <sup>3</sup> <https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/humanities/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area>

{11}------------------------------------------------

# <span id="page-11-0"></span>1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

# <span id="page-11-1"></span>1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website [\(www.jcq.org.uk\)](http://www.jcq.org.uk/).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

{12}------------------------------------------------

# <span id="page-12-0"></span>2 SUBJECT CONTENT AND INTEGRATION OF LEARNING EXPERIENCES AND SKILLS

# <span id="page-12-1"></span>How to read the amplification

The amplification provided in the right-hand column uses the following three stems:

- 'Learners should be aware of' is used when learners do not need to understand all aspects of the specified content in detail. Teachers should refer to Guidance for Teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and breadth to which this content should be taught.
- 'Learners should understand' is used when learners are required to demonstrate and apply knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and can synthesise and evaluate information for a given purpose.
- 'Learners should be able to' is used when learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to source material or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques.

The use of the word 'including' indicates that the specified content must be taught and could be subject to assessment.

The use of the words 'for example' or 'such as' indicates that the specified content is for guidance only, and alternative examples could be chosen.

Each option begins with a background section. These sections are intended to provide learners with necessary context in order to access the historical topic. Learners will not be directly assessed on the content of the background sections.

# <span id="page-12-2"></span>A note on terminology

WJEC recognises and welcomes the debates regarding the decolonisation of history and continues to work to provide a curriculum that reflects the world as it is. Some of the terminology that is used within the specification continues the use of Eurocentric words and ideas, for example, the division of historical periods into medieval, early modern, and modern eras. The debate about the relevance of these terms is ongoing; however, we have, for now, continued their use to offer clarity for learners and teachers. You may wish to avoid using these terms, and so can use the following timeframes to align with the requirements of the specification across the four units of study:

- Medieval history, or the period from c.500 to c.1450 CE
- Early modern history, or the period from c.1450 to c.1750 CE
- Modern history, or the period from c.1750 CE to up to ten years prior to a year group's commencement of the course.

Other terminology used has been selected with care, and we would encourage centres to reflect this when developing learning and teaching. For example, the term "enslaved African" is preferable to "slave", as is the use of African American rather than black or Black American in the period up to the 1970s. After this, some people prefer to use the term black or Black American, and we encourage you to investigate this prior to commencement of study in this area. Currently, terminology outside of the US indicates that the preferred usage is black or Black. When referring to global majority citizens, it is preferable to use their specific heritage where it is known and where possible. Pejorative terminology should only ever be used in a historical context, for example, in source material contemporary to the period. In the specification, we have used the preferred term of Indigenous Peoples and advise learners and teachers to use this terminology in their work.

{13}------------------------------------------------

If you have any concerns regarding the terminology used, please contact WJEC.

# <span id="page-53-0"></span>Unit 4

#### **A changing society**

Non-examination assessment: 4 hours 15 minutes Marked by centre and moderated by WJEC 20% of qualification 80 marks

#### **Overview of unit**

The purpose of this unit is to provide an insight into the different experiences of people through the study of themed events within an extended timeframe. The experiences of the people studied are limited to the islands of Great Britain and/or Ireland.

The unit will be based on the following concepts:

- continuity and change
- similarity and difference
- significance and impact
- cause and consequence.

#### **Areas of content**

#### **A period of change in society**

Learners are required to undertake a historical enquiry based on a thematic study of a continuous period of c.75 to c.100 years in order to understand a period of change in society.

The period studied can be medieval, early modern or modern.

Learners should understand discrete historical topics related to each of the following nine themes (the historical topics will be identified by the teacher):

- culture
- equality and inequality
- ethnicity
- international relations
- peace and conflict
- politics
- religion
- sex, sexuality and gender
- social and economic issues.

The geographical location of the study must be located within the islands of Great Britain and/or Ireland. The study may use all of the region or identify specific areas to be addressed.

Each of the historical topics is not expected to cover the whole of the period of study, instead it is likely that they will form episodes of the change in society within the chosen timeframe. Learners should be able to identify links between topics where relevant.

During the course of study, learners should engage with four items (two historical sources and two interpretations) per theme. A selection of these studied items will then make up the evidence for the enquiry.

Together, the selected historical topics should provide coverage of the whole period and illustrate change over time.

{54}------------------------------------------------

#### **4. A changing society**

In this unit learners will gain knowledge, skills and understanding of the following areas:

# <span id="page-57-0"></span>3.2 Overview of arrangements for non-examination assessment

#### **Unit 2: Overview**

Learners will complete the assessment of Unit 2 digitally through WJEC's eassessment platform.

For the assignment, learners will undertake a historical enquiry, providing a focused response on a specific issue. They will:

- Stage 1: Review the question, timeline and narrative and form a hypothesis
- Stage 2: Review and critically analyse the evidence (items)
- Stage 3: Plan the response
- Stage 4: Develop the response
- Stage 5: Critically reflect on the process they have undertaken and the conclusion they have reached.

The items (sources and interpretations) for the enquiry will be released during the first week of June for assessment in the following academic year and will change annually. Centres have the flexibility to decide when, in the period between 7 January and 31 March, learners undertake the assignment. The question that makes up the focus of the historical enquiry will be available within WJEC's e-assessment platform from the start of the assessment window, alongside a brief narrative and a timeline of the period.

This assessment contributes to 20% of the overall qualification grade and will take 3 hours to complete. The assignment may be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions. The assignment will be marked out of a total of 80 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment and will be marked by WJEC.

#### **Unit 4: Overview**

For the assignment, learners will undertake a historical enquiry, providing an understanding of change across a period of c.75-c.100 years. They will:

- Stage 1: Select the question, review the evidence and form a hypothesis
- Stage 2: Review and critically analyse the evidence (items)
- Stage 3: Plan the response
- Stage 4: Develop the response
- Stage 5: Critically reflect on the process they have undertaken and the conclusion they have reached

The historical enquiry will focus on two of the nine themes studied for Unit 4. Two set themes will be released by WJEC during the first week of September for assessment in that academic year and will change annually. Centres have the flexibility to decide when during the year learners undertake the assignment.

This assessment contributes to 20% of the overall qualification grade and will take 4 hours and 15 minutes to complete. The assignment could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions. The assignment will be marked out of a total of 80 marks.

This unit will be assessed through an externally set assignment, will be marked by the centre and moderated by WJEC.

{58}------------------------------------------------

# <span id="page-58-0"></span>4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for GCSE History.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our [Guide to preventing, reporting and](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)  [investigating malpractice.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC (malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet [Suspected](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)  [Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)

# <span id="page-59-0"></span>5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

### <span id="page-59-1"></span>5.1 Entries and awards

This is a unitised qualification. Learners are entered for each unit separately.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series each year, until the end of the life of the specification.

Unit 1, Unit 2 and Unit 3 will be available in 2026 (and each year thereafter). Unit 4 will be available in 2027 (and each year thereafter) and the qualification will be awarded for the first time in summer 2028.

#### Pre-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or under on 31st August in the academic year in which they were entered)

The terminal rule is set at 40% of the overall qualification for Pre-16 Candidates for GCSE History.

If the assessment being re-taken contributes to the 40% terminal rule requirement, the mark for the new assessment will count regardless of previous results in the assessment.

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade subject to the terminal rule being satisfied first, i.e. that candidates must complete 40% of the assessment for a qualification in the series in which they are cashing in.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s). This is referred to as a 'fresh start'. When retaking a qualification (fresh start), a candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from examination units taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating the new grade(s).

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be used for the life of the specification.

#### Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1st September in the academic year in which they are entered)

There is no terminal rule that applies to Post-16 Candidates for GCSE History.

There is no limit on the number of times a candidate can resit an individual unit; however, the better uniform mark score from the most two recent attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade.

The 'fresh start' rule does not apply to post-16 candidates.

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in the final resit series.
