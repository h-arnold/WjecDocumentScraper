GCSE HISTORY 7

This is a unitised qualification.

The combination of options selected for Units 1, 2 and 3 must include one medieval, one
early modern and one modern unit.

In Unit 4, centres can choose to repeat a time period previously studied in Units 1, 2 or 3.
However, the topics chosen for study in Unit 4 must not replicate or overlap with the
content of any of the other selected units.

It would be most appropriate for learners to complete Unit 4 in the final year of the course as
they revisit a time period previously studied in one of the earlier units. This would allow
learners to implement their understanding of historical concepts and the analysis and
evaluation skills they have developed throughout Units 1 and 3. It would also allow learners
to build on the approaches and practices developed when undertaking a historical enquiry in
Unit 2.

There is no hierarchy implied by the order in which Units 1 to 3 are presented. Therefore, the
order does not imply a prescribed teaching order.

The examinations for Units 1 and 3, and the submission of Unit 2 will be available for the first
time in summer 2027. The submission of Unit 4 will be available for the first time in summer
2028. Each assessment will then be available every summer series.

The qualification will be awarded for the first time in summer 2028.

GCSE HISTORY

1.

INTRODUCTION

1.1  Aims

GCSE History qualification supports Learners to:

•  develop their knowledge and understanding of specific historical events, periods

and societies on a local, national and global scale

•  extend their understanding and appreciation of the identity, heritage and history

of Wales and the world and to develop a sense of cynefin

•  become independent, critical and reflective historians through the skills of

historical enquiry, questioning, and source analysis and evaluation

•  construct valid and realistic historical claims by using a range of sources in

context to reach substantiated judgements

•  demonstrate critical appreciation of the concept of historical significance,

including:
•  why some people, events and developments are seen as historically

significant

•  why different interpretations have been constructed about historically

significant people, events and developments

•  acquire an understanding of different identities, including their own, within a

complex, pluralistic and diverse society.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales’ Approval Criteria.

1.2  Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE History qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales
framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make
progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to
this design are the principles of progression, along with the statements of what
matters and those subject specific skills and concepts outlined in the ‘Designing your
Curriculum’ section of the Humanities Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to
embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral
skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple
mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for
Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for
integrating the learning experiences noted on page 54; the Guidance for Teaching
will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2024

GCSE HISTORY 9

The GCSE History qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:

•  supporting the statements of what matters1 by giving learners the opportunity to:
•  gain a deeper understanding of the concepts underpinning humanities, and

their application in local, national and global contexts

•  gather, justify, present, analyse, and evaluate a range of evidence
•  draw informed conclusions, but also understand that some conclusions can

only be partial or inconclusive and open to different interpretations

•  critically review the ways events and experiences are perceived, interpreted

•

and represented
learn how various worldviews and factors can influence their own and others’
perceptions and interpretations, exploring how and why interpretations may
differ

•  develop an appreciation of identity, heritage and cynefin, including the history

of Wales and the World

•  develop an understanding of the complex, pluralistic and diverse nature of
societies, past and present, in particular the stories of Black, Asian and
Minority Ethnic people

•  build an understanding of the causes, consequences and significance of the
changes and interrelationships that have shaped societies at different levels
of development

•  understand how societies are and have been organised, structured and led in

learners’ own localities and in Wales, as well as in the wider world

•  explore the connections and interdependence between such societies in the

past and present, in the context of a globalised world

•  understand the interconnected nature of economic, environmental and social
sustainability, justice and authority, and the need to live in and contribute to a
fair and inclusive society that confronts and addresses racism

•  critically reflect on their own and others’ beliefs, values and attitudes
•  consider the impact of their actions when making choices and exercising their

democratic rights and responsibilities
justify their decisions.

•

•  supporting the principles of progression2 by encouraging learners to:

•  ask increasingly sophisticated enquiry questions
•

find suitable information, making informed predictions and hypotheses, and
making judgments about reliability and utility

•  engage with an increasing breadth and depth of knowledge and underlying

concepts to build an increasingly clear and coherent understanding of the
world around them

•

•  work with an increasing number and sophistication of sources of information,
and a growing understanding of how to resolve contradictory or conflicting
accounts
transfer existing skills and knowledge into new, and increasingly unfamiliar
contexts, making links within and between periods and places, identifying
similarities and differences, changes and continuities
identify connections between new and previous learning with greater
understanding of the world, of other people and their values, in different
times, places and circumstances.

GCSE HISTORY 10

The construct of GCSE History qualification is based on the Welsh Government
subject specific considerations for History3. The qualification:
•  provides opportunities to understand different periods, events, people and
cultures in history, exploring these at a local, national and global scale
•  provides opportunities to understand the significance of people, events and

developments in history and how these can be interpreted in different ways: in
different places and at different times

•  equips learners with the skills to understand, interpret and evaluate historical

evidence in order to make informed judgements

•  equips learners with the skills to make sense of their place and the place of

others within the framework of human experience

•  provides opportunities to develop curiosity and empathy as well as the ability to
filter and critically analyse the breadth of information available to us, to make
informed and balanced judgements that foster a sense of cynefin and one's place
in the world.

The GCSE History qualification is also based on the following historical concepts
listed within the Approval Criteria:
•  continuity and change
•  similarity and difference
•  significance and impact
•  cause and consequence.

Each of these concepts support the Welsh Government’s ‘designing your curriculum’
guidance as well as those within the statements of what matters and progression
steps for Humanities.

1.3  Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is
designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the
conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages
3–14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills
and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares
learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation
for the study of History at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a
coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress
to further study in this subject.

1.4  Guided learning hours

GCSE History has been designed to be delivered within 120–140 guided learning
hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for
learners in years 10 and 11.

1.5  Use of language

GCSE HISTORY 11

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our
language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect
and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and
adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising
that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to
ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres
of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always
be on the website.

1.6  Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic,
religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible,
features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access
and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender
reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual
orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to
enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills
without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the
following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access
Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This
document is available on the JCQ website (www.jcq.org.uk).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of
provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete
barrier to any part of the assessment.

SUBJECT CONTENT AND INTEGRATION OF
LEARNING EXPERIENCES AND SKILLS

How to read the amplification

GCSE HISTORY 12

The amplification provided in the right-hand column uses the following three stems:
•

‘Learners should be aware of’ is used when learners do not need to understand all
aspects of the specified content in detail. Teachers should refer to Guidance for
Teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and breadth to which this content
should be taught.
‘Learners should understand’ is used when learners are required to demonstrate and
apply knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and can synthesise and evaluate
information for a given purpose.
‘Learners should be able to’ is used when learners need to apply their knowledge and
understanding to source material or demonstrate application of practical skills and
techniques.

•

•

The use of the word 'including' indicates that the specified content must be taught and could
be subject to assessment.

The use of the words ‘for example’ or ‘such as’ indicates that the specified content is for
guidance only, and alternative examples could be chosen.

Each option begins with a background section. These sections are intended to provide
learners with necessary context in order to access the historical topic. Learners will not be
directly assessed on the content of the background sections.

A note on terminology

WJEC recognises and welcomes the debates regarding the decolonisation of history and
continues to work to provide a curriculum that reflects the world as it is. Some of the
terminology that is used within the specification continues the use of Eurocentric words and
ideas, for example, the division of historical periods into medieval, early modern, and
modern eras. The debate about the relevance of these terms is ongoing; however, we have,
for now, continued their use to offer clarity for learners and teachers. You may wish to avoid
using these terms, and so can use the following timeframes to align with the requirements of
the specification across the four units of study:

•  Medieval history, or the period from c.500 to c.1450 CE
•  Early modern history, or the period from c.1450 to c.1750 CE
•  Modern history, or the period from c.1750 CE to up to ten years prior to a year group’s

commencement of the course.

Other terminology used has been selected with care, and we would encourage centres to
reflect this when developing learning and teaching. For example, the term “enslaved African”
is preferable to “slave”, as is the use of African American rather than black or Black
American in the period up to the 1970s. After this, some people prefer to use the term black
or Black American, and we encourage you to investigate this prior to commencement of
study in this area. Currently, terminology outside of the US indicates that the preferred usage
is black or Black. When referring to global majority citizens, it is preferable to use their
specific heritage where it is known and where possible. Pejorative terminology should only
ever be used in a historical context, for example, in source material contemporary to the
period. In the specification, we have used the preferred term of Indigenous Peoples and
advise learners and teachers to use this terminology in their work.

Unit 4

A changing society

Non-examination assessment: 4 hours 15 minutes
Marked by centre and moderated by WJEC
20% of qualification
80 marks

Overview of unit

The purpose of this unit is to provide an insight into the different experiences of people
through the study of themed events within an extended timeframe. The experiences of the
people studied are limited to the islands of Great Britain and/or Ireland.

The unit will be based on the following concepts:
•  continuity and change
•  similarity and difference
•  significance and impact
•  cause and consequence.

Areas of content

A period of change in society

Learners are required to undertake a historical enquiry based on a thematic study of a
continuous period of c.75 to c.100 years in order to understand a period of change in
society.

The period studied can be medieval, early modern or modern.

Learners should understand discrete historical topics related to each of the following nine
themes (the historical topics will be identified by the teacher):
•  culture
•  equality and inequality
•  ethnicity
•
•  peace and conflict
•  politics
religion
•
•  sex, sexuality and gender
•  social and economic issues.

international relations

The geographical location of the study must be located within the islands of Great Britain
and/or Ireland. The study may use all of the region or identify specific areas to be
addressed.

Each of the historical topics is not expected to cover the whole of the period of study,
instead it is likely that they will form episodes of the change in society within the chosen
timeframe. Learners should be able to identify links between topics where relevant.

During the course of study, learners should engage with four items (two historical sources
and two interpretations) per theme. A selection of these studied items will then make up
the evidence for the enquiry.

Together, the selected historical topics should provide coverage of the whole period and
illustrate change over time.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION

5.1  Entries and awards

GCSE HISTORY 59

This is a unitised qualification. Learners are entered for each unit separately.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series each year, until the
end of the life of the specification.

Unit 1, Unit 2 and Unit 3 will be available in 2026 (and each year thereafter). Unit 4
will be available in 2027 (and each year thereafter) and the qualification will be
awarded for the first time in summer 2028.

Pre-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or under on 31st
academic year in which they were entered)

 August in the

The terminal rule is set at 40% of the overall qualification for Pre-16 Candidates for
GCSE History.

If the assessment being re-taken contributes to the 40% terminal rule requirement,
the mark for the new assessment will count regardless of previous results in the
assessment.

Candidates may resit an individual unit once only. The better uniform mark score
from the two attempts will be used in calculating the final overall grade subject to the
terminal rule being satisfied first, i.e. that candidates must complete 40% of the
assessment for a qualification in the series in which they are cashing in.

If any unit has been attempted twice and a candidate wishes to enter the unit for the
third time, the candidate will have to re-enter all units and the appropriate cash-in(s).
This is referred to as a 'fresh start'. When retaking a qualification (fresh start), a
candidate may have up to two attempts at each unit. However, no results from
examination units taken prior to the fresh start can be used in aggregating the new
grade(s).

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not
count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in
the final resit series.

Marks for non-examination assessment may be used for the life of the specification.

Post-16 Candidates (i.e. candidates who are 16 or over on 1st
academic year in which they are entered)

 September in the

There is no terminal rule that applies to Post-16 Candidates for GCSE History.

There is no limit on the number of times a candidate can resit an individual unit;
however, the better uniform mark score from the most two recent attempts will be
used in calculating the final overall grade.

The ‘fresh start’ rule does not apply to post-16 candidates.

If a candidate has been entered for but is absent for a unit, the absence does not
count as an attempt. The candidate would, however, qualify as a resit candidate in
the final resit series.
