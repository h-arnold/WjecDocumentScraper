Local, National &
International Contexts

Option 2.1 Genghis Khan c.1162–c.1227 allows learners to explore international medieval history within
Asia, from the steppes of the nomadic Mongol tribes, through to the Khwarazmian Empire in the west of
Asia, to the kingdoms of Western Xia and the Jin dynasty in eastern Asia. There are also links to the ancient
Silk Road, the trading route from the eastern coast of China to eastern Mediterranean and northern Africa.

Learners will understand that the Mongol nomads were a product of their environment as it influenced both
their ambitions and the way they fought. There has also been recent research into the impact the Mongols
had on climate change, especially during the era of Genghis Khan.

Sustainability

Learners could research the impact of the geography of the steppes on Mongol conquests, as well as the
debates about the influence of the Medieval Warm Period on their success.

 GCSE History Unit 2 Option 2.1 Genghis Khan c.1162–c.1227 Guidance for Teaching  33

Learners will understand that the study of Genghis Khan is a study of imperialism as the Mongol Empire
spread across Asia and that the countries conquered by the Mongols were colonised as well, their local laws
being replaced by the Mongo law code. This Empire stretched across Asia and encompassed many different
peoples, from the Mongol nomads to the Chinese in the east and the Muslims in the West.

Human Rights Education and
Diversity

Learners should understand the violent nature of Temujin’s rise to power consolidating his control over the
Mongol Tribes, the significance of the title Genghis Khan, and the destruction caused by the Mongol
subjugation of two of the kingdoms of China, as well as the Muslim empire to the west.

Learners should engage with the toleration and appreciation of diversity within the Mongol law code that was
imposed upon its territories.
