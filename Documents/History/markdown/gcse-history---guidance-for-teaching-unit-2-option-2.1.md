| Make appropriate use of digital technology when completing the qualification, for example through accessing historical source material digitally | Learners should have the opportunity to access online archives from around the world. This will enable them to access a range of historical source materials such as letters, diaries or government documents. |  |
|  | Learners may also make use of digital technology to research the topic of study and to further their understanding of the historical context. |  |
|  | Learners will also have the opportunity to complete their historical enquiry digitally, as part of the assessment of this unit. |  |
| Participate in educational visits in person or digitally | Virtual tours of the Silk Roads through Asia are supported by the UNESCO Silk Roads project https://en.unesco.org/silkroad/ |  |
| Develop empathy, tolerance, compassion and curiosity through studying different historical contexts | The study of the Mongols' tolerance of other religions within their empire is an important part of the legacy of Genghis Khan, along with the yassa law code of the empire which granted equal rights to all citizens. |  |
| Engage in collaborative working | There are many examples for discussions, such as: <ul><li>the importance of the steppe environment and Asia's trade routes for people like the Mongols – why might they lead to the creation of an empire?</li><li>why the Mongols were often more successful than their neighbours</li><li>the importance of the anda blood oath</li><li>how powerful Genghis Khan was as the sole ruler of the Mongol Empire</li><li>how legal rights in the Mongol Empire compares to the rights of citizens of Wales today</li><li>the similarities and differences between the ancient Roman and Mongol armies</li><li>how dynastic disputes in China made it easier for the Mongols to successfully invade</li><li>the limitations of the Mongol invasion of China – where didn't they manage to take control over?</li></ul> |  |

{34}------------------------------------------------

There are also opportunities for debates, such as:

- how effectively Temujin became khan, with one side arguing he was very efficient and the other side arguing how precarious his victory was
- which was the most important reason for the Mongol Conquest of the Khwarazmian Empire – the weakness of the empire, the murder of the Mongol envoys or the importance of accessing the Silk Road.

| Local, National & International Contexts | Option 2.1 Genghis Khan c.1162–c.1227 allows learners to explore international medieval history within Asia, from the steppes of the nomadic Mongol tribes, through to the Khwarazmian Empire in the west of Asia, to the kingdoms of Western Xia and the Jin dynasty in eastern Asia. There are also links to the ancient Silk Road, the trading route from the eastern coast of China to eastern Mediterranean and northern Africa. |  |
| Sustainability | Learners will understand that the Mongol nomads were a product of their environment as it influenced both their ambitions and the way they fought. There has also been recent research into the impact the Mongols had on climate change, especially during the era of Genghis Khan. Learners could research the impact of the geography of the steppes on Mongol conquests, as well as the |  |
|  | debates about the influence of the Medieval Warm Period on their success. Learners could also research the ongoing debate about the extent to which the conquests of Genghis Khan influenced climate change in this period. |  |
| Relationships and Sexuality Education | Learners will have the opportunity to explore the distinctive features of Mongol society including their nomadic lifestyle and their belief in shamanism. Learners should study the Mongol yassa law code that was imposed on conquered territories, especially its emphasis on religious tolerance and inclusion, with its terms granting equal rights to all citizens of the empire. |  |
|  | Learners should be able to discuss the contradictions of the violence of the Mongol conquests with the tolerance, diversity and stability brought by the Pax Mongolica. |  |

{36}------------------------------------------------

# Human Rights Education and Diversity

Learners will understand that the study of Genghis Khan is a study of imperialism as the Mongol Empire spread across Asia and that the countries conquered by the Mongols were colonised as well, their local laws being replaced by the Mongo law code. This Empire stretched across Asia and encompassed many different peoples, from the Mongol nomads to the Chinese in the east and the Muslims in the West.

Learners should understand the violent nature of Temujin's rise to power consolidating his control over the Mongol Tribes, the significance of the title Genghis Khan, and the destruction caused by the Mongol subjugation of two of the kingdoms of China, as well as the Muslim empire to the west.

Learners should engage with the toleration and appreciation of diversity within the Mongol law code that was imposed upon its territories.
