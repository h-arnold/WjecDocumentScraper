#### Answer all questions in **either** Section A **or** Section B

#### **Section A**

#### **3.5 Russia and the Soviet Union c.1861–c.1953**

- Describe the key events of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. **[5] 0 1**
- Explain why Nicholas II abdicated in 1917. **[10] 0 2**
- This is a two-part question. Answer part (a) then part (b). Part (b) must be answered in continuous text.  **0 3**
  - **(a)** Describe the famine of 1921–1922. **[5]**
  - **(b)** Compare **and** contrast Item 1 and Item 2 as evidence to a historian studying Lenin's New Economic Policy (NEP)**. [15]**

# **Item 1**

Walter Duranty, an Anglo–American journalist in Moscow, writing in the article "Lenin Places Hope in his New Policy" for the *New York Times* (September 1921)

The new policy aims to help the peasants. Sections in it, which establish freedom of private trading and encourage the use of money, are designed to reassure the agricultural peasant producer that he will be able to sell food and buy manufactured goods with the proceeds. The sections designed to increase industrial production by the lease of factories and the reintroduction of the system of bonuses will provide manufactured goods for the peasant to buy.

### **Item 2**

An anonymous author, writing on the page "The New Economic Policy" on the *Alpha History* website (2018). The website is an international collective highly qualified authors writing to produce free resources to support teaching and learning.

The New Economic Policy (NEP) was an economic strategy developed by Lenin and implemented in 1921. It replaced the previous economic policy, war communism, which had been in place since 1918. The NEP involved significant economic relaxations and freedoms designed to provide what Lenin called "breathing space" for Russia's warravaged economy. This policy was successful in that it produced recovery and relative gains, particularly in the agricultural sector; however, it also invited criticism of the Soviet government, including from within the ranks of the Communist Party.

- This is a two-part question. Answer part (a) then part (b). Part (b) must be answered in continuous text.  **0 4**
  - **(a)** Describe Stalin's Five-Year Plans. **[5]**
  - **(b)** Evaluate the view in **Item 3** that life under Stalin's rule was better for ordinary people. **[20]**

**Item 3** Chris Trueman, a History teacher, writing in the article "Life in USSR Under Stalin" on the website for students *History Learning Site* (c. early twenty-first century)

Living standards rose in the 1930s in Russia despite the problems with food production and shortages in other countries. Some people did very well, especially party officials and skilled factory workers. Healthcare was greatly expanded. In the past, the poorer people of Russia could not have qualified for medical help in times of illness. Now that it was available, demand was very high. The number of doctors rose greatly.

#### **3.6 Changes in US society c.1880 – c.1980**

- Describe the activities of the Ku Klux Klan. **[5] 0 5**
- Explain why Franklin D Roosevelt introduced the New Deal. **[10] 0 6**
- This is a two-part question. Answer part (a) then part (b). Part (b) must be answered in continuous text.  **0 7**
  - **(a)** Describe the impact of mass production in the 1920s. **[5]**
  - **(b)** Compare **and** contrast Item 1 and Item 2 as evidence to a historian studying why the US economy boomed in the 1920s. **[15]**

# **Item 1**

Dan Moorhouse, a teacher, author and member of the Royal Historical Society, writing in the article "Causes of the Economic Boom in America in the 1920s" on his *Schools History Website* (2018)

The Republican governments of Presidents Harding, Coolidge and Hoover, tried to help American businesses by increasing taxes on foreign goods coming into the US. This was achieved by passing a new law called the Fordney–McCumber Tariff Act in 1922. These new import taxes were called 'tariffs' and made goods that were made outside of the US more expensive to buy. This in turn encouraged Americans to buy goods made in the US. This led to a boom or an increase in the amount of goods being made and sold by US businesses.

**Item 2** Donald Rea Hanson, a financial journalist, writing in his article "Why This Prosperity?" in the US magazine *The Forum* (July 1929)

Most of us have some superficial idea as to the causes underlying the prosperity of the past six or eight years, but our views are likely to be colored by prejudice, politics, occupation or previous condition [prior social status].

To the banker it might be the gold stock of the country. To the head of a labor union it might be high wages and the rise in the standard of living. The manufacturer would point to the development of mass production. An employee on Wall Street would look to the confidence inspired by the election of President Coolidge in 1924, and the foreign observer would insist that the war, which changed this nation from a debtor to a creditor nation, to which Europeans must pay tribute for years to come, was the real cause of our prosperity.

{7}------------------------------------------------

- This is a two-part question. Answer part (a) then part (b). Part (b) must be answered in continuous text.  **0 8**
  - **(a)** Describe civil rights legislation passed in the 1960s. **[5]**
  - **(b)** Evaluate the view in **Item 3** that Malcom X had no lasting impact on the civil rights movement. **[20]**

**Item 3** Nathan J Robinson, a writer and commentator, and Oren Nimni, a civil rights lawyer, writing in the article "Reflections on Malcolm X" in the left-wing magazine *Current Affairs (2018)*

Because Malcolm died young, and did not live to build the Organization of Afro-American Unity [OAAU] into a major political force, one can look back and wonder what he stood for and what his significance was. But civil rights leaders of Malcolm's time were not wrong in pointing out that his activities had made him politically marginal, that there were not obvious material gains that can be traced to Malcolm X.

#### **MARK SCHEME**

#### **Guidance for examiners**

#### **Generic marking principles**

- Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
- Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.
- Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
- Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

#### **Positive marking**

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising him/her for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates' answers. The list is not exhaustive. The inclusion of *'Credit any other valid response.*' (or similar instruction) within mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates' responses. Credit should be given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates' answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However, unless there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks where the answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

#### **Banded mark schemes**

For band-marked questions mark schemes are in two parts: the indicative content and the assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in candidates' answers. It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate's response. As noted above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive, and candidates do not have to include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been provided, no marks should be awarded.

{9}------------------------------------------------

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each candidate's response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills, knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors or omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate's answer to pick out the evidence that is being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied. This is done as a two-stage process.

#### **Stage 1 – Deciding on the band**

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate's answer and check whether it matches the descriptors for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the descriptors match the answer.

If an answer covers different aspects of different bands within the mark scheme, a 'best fit' approach should be adopted to decide on the band and then the candidate's response should be used to decide on the mark within the band. For instance, if a response is mainly in band 2 but with a limited amount of band 3 content, the answer would be placed in band 2, but the mark awarded would be close to the top of band 2 as a result of the band 3 content.

Examiners should not seek to mark candidates down as a result of small omissions in minor areas of an answer.

#### **Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark**

During standardising (the marking conference), detailed advice from the Principal Examiner on the qualities of each mark band will be given. Examiners will then receive examples of answers in each mark band that have been awarded a mark by the Principal Examiner. Examiners should mark the examples and compare their marks with those of the Principal Examiner.

When marking, examiners can use these examples to decide whether a candidate's response is of a superior, inferior or comparable standard to the example. Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the answer as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the response provided.

| Question 1 |  | Total marks |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
|            | Describe the key events of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution. | [5]            |

#### **Indicative Content**

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- The revolution began in February 1917 with strikes and protests over food shortages and war fatigue. This led to abdication of Tsar Nicholas II and the establishment of a weak provisional government in March 1917.
- Lenin returned from exile in April 1917 and called for revolution and for people to reject the Provisional Government in his 'April Thesis'. He inspired the support of many who did not have confidence in the Provisional Government. In July 1917, there were armed protests by soldiers, sailors and workers showing that the discontent was widespread. In August 1917, there was a failed coup against the Provisional Government (the Kornilov Affair).
- Tensions peaked in October 1917, when the Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, seized power. A new Soviet government was set up with Lenin as leader.

| Question 2 | Total marks |

| Explain why Nicholas II abdicated in 1917. |                |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- Russia suffered heavy losses during the First World War, which led to widespread disillusionment in the army and amongst the public. In 1915, the Tsar had taken personal command of the military, so he was blamed for these losses and defeats, which eroded his support.
- Furthermore, the Tsar was reluctant to undertake any political reform; he dismissed the Duma whenever it posed a challenge, which led to anger in the nobility and middle class. Consequently, the Duma increasingly opposed the Tsar and supported the formation of a provisional government.
- There was a loss of public confidence in the Tsar as a result of the influence of Rasputin. This further damaged the Tsar's reputation and when there was widespread unrest in February 1917, the army began to sympathise with the protesters with many soldiers refusing to obey orders. Some deserted the front line, making the Tsar look weak. Nicholas was forced to abdicate in March 1917 as he had lost control as well as the support of the people.

| Question 3(a) |  | Total marks |
|-----------------------------------|--|----------------|
| Describe the famine of 1921–1922. |  | [5]            |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- The famine of 1921–2 had several causes, including the impact of the First World War, civil war and bad weather that led to drought in 1921 and severe crop failures.
- The situation was made worse by logistical challenges as a result of the inefficient rail system which could not transport food effectively. This led to delays in food distribution and relief and the situation worsening in rural areas.
- Between 5 and 7 million people died, with the Volga and Ural River regions being particularly badly affected. During the famine, diseases such as cholera and typhus spread and some of the starving were alleged to have turned to cannibalism as there was insufficient state relief.

| Question 3(b) | Total marks |  |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--|
| Compare and contrast Item 1 and Item 2 as evidence to a historian studying Lenin's New Economic Policy (NEP). |  |  |
| Item 1 Walter Duranty, an Anglo–American journalist in Moscow, writing in the article "Lenin Places Hope in his New Policy" for the New York Times (September 1921) |  |  |
| The new policy aims to help the peasants. Sections in it, which establish freedom of private trading and encourage the use of money, are designed to reassure the agricultural peasant producer that he will be able to sell food and buy manufactured goods with the proceeds. The sections designed to increase industrial production by the lease of factories and the reintroduction of the system of bonuses will provide manufactured goods for the peasant to buy. |  |  |
| Item 2 An anonymous author, writing on the page "The New Economic Policy" on the Alpha History website (2018). The website is an international collective highly qualified authors writing to produce free resources to support teaching and learning. |  |  |
| The New Economic Policy (NEP) was an economic strategy developed by Lenin and implemented in 1921. It replaced the previous economic policy, war communism, which had been in place since 1918. The NEP involved significant economic relaxations and freedoms designed to provide what Lenin called "breathing space" for Russia's depleted and war-ravaged economy. This policy was successful in that it produced recovery and relative gains, particularly in the agricultural sector; however, it also invited criticism of the Soviet government, including from within the ranks of the Communist Party. |  |  |

{15}------------------------------------------------

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

#### **Comparisons:**

- Both Item 1 and Item 2 focus on Lenin's role in developing and implementing the New Economic Policy.
- Both Item 1 and Item 2 emphasise that the policy's desired aims were to support the agricultural economy.
- Both Item 1 and Item 2 emphasise that there was a relaxation or freedom of economic rules.
- Both Item 1 and Item 2 offer an outsider view of the New Economic Policy, the first from a contemporary article in a US newspaper, and the second an overview from an educational website looking back on the period.

#### **Contrasts:**

- Item 1 provides information on the aspirations of the policy at the time of its introduction whereas Item 2 goes beyond this and supplies a summary judgement of some of the policy's successes.
- Item 2 indicates the reasons for the development of the New Economic Policy, indicating that the previous policy war Communism had been insufficient in resolving the economic problems caused by the war. Item 1, on the other hand, focuses on the policy as a means of aiding the peasants to be more productive and facilitate their purchase of manufactured goods.
- Item 2 indicates that there was hostility towards the policy from within Communism, whereas the author of Item 1 may not be aware of this. Written in September 1921 by Walter Duranty, who is someone outside of the Communist Party, it is unlikely that he would have an awareness of the scepticism that existed within the party, especially at this early time.

| Describe Stalin's Five-Year Plans. |                |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- The Five-Year Plans (First Five-Year Plan 1928–32, Second Five-Year Plan 1933–7 and Third Five-Year Plan 1938–41) introduced centralised control of the economy in order to improve production and output.
- The government set ambitious production targets set for all sectors with infrastructure such as factories, railways and power plants built to support this industrial growth. Collectivisation of agriculture developed large state-controlled farms to increase productivity and remove private land ownership
- Worker incentives were introduced with strict discipline and penalties for underperformance. The Stakhanovite movement promoted hard work: productivity was glorified and workers often encouraged to achieve unrealistic quotas.

- The view expressed in Item 3 is that life under Stalin was better for the ordinary people in terms of living standards and access to medical treatment. As the item states, the Five-Year Plans encouraged industrial growth, which provided employment opportunities. This was especially the case in cities with industrialisation and urban development.
- There were also social and health benefits for ordinary people, for example literacy rates rose as free and compulsory education was provided. Additionally, there were some improvements for women under Stalin's regime such as the provision of childcare, work opportunities and the construction of housing, which also reduced homelessness. As a result of these changes women were able to gain a greater level of financial independence.
- Item 3 is written by a History teacher in an article aimed at students, which means that it may be a simplified account of events. It is taken from a website that has the purpose of providing support for learners and is thus not likely an academic study.
- Candidates may challenge the view presented by emphasising other factors. For example, despite there being some social gains there was intense political repression. During Stalin's rule there was constant monitoring by the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), purges, show trials, executions and the imprisonment of perceived enemies. People faced harsh conditions in the labour camps (Gulags), and mosques, temples and churches were destroyed to promote atheism. Further, personal freedom was restricted with severe punishments for those not abiding by the rules.
- It may be argued that collectivization of agriculture forced peasants into collective farms, and that this disrupted rural life and led to widespread famine. As a result of these economic changes, people faced hardships such as poor living conditions and shortages of goods.

• Candidates may argue that the statement is largely true, pointing to the benefits they experienced in the 1930s, or they may argue that it is partially true, offering judgement on both positives and negatives. Alternatively, they may judge that the statement is largely untrue, with the difficulties of life in the Stalinist Soviet Union outweighing any positive aspects.

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- The Ku Klux Klan used terror, violence and intimidation against African Americans and other minority groups. Their activities included lynchings, beatings and arson to assert their white supremacist views. They instilled fear into communities and enforced segregation within the southern states.
- The Ku Klux Klan spread white supremacist ideas through rallies, marches and pamphlets. They encouraged white Anglo-Saxon protestants (WASPs) from a wide range of economic backgrounds to join the Klan and actively publicised their views.
- The Klan influenced politics, often stopped African Americans from voting and ensured that Jim Crow laws were followed in the southern states.

| Explain why Franklin D Roosevelt introduced the New Deal. | [10]           |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- Franklin D Roosevelt introduced the New Deal for immediate economic relief through job creation and the reduction of unemployment levels. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and Works Progress Administration (WPA) aimed to tackle unemployment and poverty.
- Furthermore, Roosevelt aimed to revive the economy which in turn would make the US more prosperous. Acts were passed to support industries such as the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) and the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA).
- The New Deal aimed to restore public confidence in the government through structural reform. Acts were passed to protect workers, consumers and the financial system. Roosevelt used a series of 'fireside chats' to share this vision with the people.

| Describe the impact of mass production in the 1920s. |  |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- Mass production increased the speed and quantity and of goods produced, making production more efficient. This in turn led to a reduction in manufacturing costs, making products cheaper for consumers, which increased demand for products such as cars.
- Furthermore, mass production techniques led to the creation of many new jobs, although the work was often repetitive and unskilled. People moved to cities for these factory jobs, speeding up urban growth and social change.
- There was also a broader economic growth as a result of mass production. More affordable goods led to a boom in consumer spending and advertising which stimulated all areas of the American economy. The economy grew rapidly, leading to the prosperous "Roaring Twenties".

| Compare and contrast the value of Item 1 and Item 2 to a historian studying why the US economy boomed in the 1920s. |  |  |
| Item 1 Dan Moorhouse, a teacher, author and member of the Royal Historical Society, writing in the article "Causes of the Economic Boom in America in the 1920s" on his Schools History Website (2018) |  |  |
| The Republican governments of Presidents Harding, Coolidge and Hoover, tried to help American businesses by increasing taxes on foreign goods coming into the US. This was achieved by passing a new law called the Fordney–McCumber Tariff Act in 1922. These new import taxes were called 'tariffs' and made goods that were made outside of the US more expensive to buy. This in turn encouraged Americans to buy goods made in the US. This led to a boom or an increase in the amount of goods being made and sold by US businesses. Item 2 Donald Rea Hanson, a financial journalist, writing in his article "Why This Prosperity?" in the US magazine The Forum (July 1929) |  |  |
| Most of us have some superficial idea as to the causes underlying the prosperity of the past six or eight years, but our views are likely to be colored by prejudice, politics, occupation or previous condition [prior social status]. |  |  |
| To the banker it might be the gold stock of the country. To the head of a labor union it might be high wages and the rise in the standard of living. The manufacturer would point to the development of mass production. An employee on Wall Street would look to the confidence inspired by the election of President Coolidge in 1924, and the foreign observer would insist that the war, which changed this nation from a debtor to a creditor nation, to which Europeans must pay tribute for years to come, was the real cause of our prosperity. |  |  |

{26}------------------------------------------------

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

#### **Comparisons:**

- Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate the US was prosperous in the 1920s and discuss factors that contributed to the economic boom.
- Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that US citizens were able to take advantage of the world economic situation, crediting industry and the US people as a reason for the economic success
- Both Item 1 and Item 2 acknowledge the role of government policies in helping economic growth through specific policies in Item 1 and post-war strategies in Item 2.

#### **Contrasts:**

- Item 1 states that the boom was a result of Republican policies (tariffs) whereas item 2 states it was a result of the impact of the First World War and US resources.
- Item 1 states that the economic prosperity was due only to tariffs stimulating economic growth whereas Item 2 states that there were multiple reasons and suggests that it is impossible to reach consensus.
- Item 2 is unable to provide clarity. Despite being written by a financial journalist, it was written ahead of the economic crash and thus cannot offer a detached overview of the reasons why the economy boomed. Item 2, however, is from an article published on an educational website in 2018 and is able to provide an overview and attempt to ascribe cause and consequence.
- There may be a comparison between the expertise of the author of Item 1 against the general nature of Item 2, however, this would be contextualised with reference to the information available to the authors. It may be noted that the expert in Item 2 recognises the problems in examining causes of an issue as complex as this.

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- The Civil Rights Act, 1964 ended segregation in public places and banned employment discrimination on the basis of colour, religion, sex or national origin. It created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to investigate job discrimination claims.
- The Voting Rights Act, 1965 aimed to eliminate racial barriers to voting. It banned the use of literacy tests, poll taxes and methods used to disenfranchise African Americans and authorised federal oversight of voter registration in areas with a history of discrimination.
- The Civil Rights Act, 1968 (Fair Housing Act) aimed to remove discrimination by stating that the sale, rental and financing of housing must be equal regardless of race, religion or national origin.

|  | Evaluate the view in Item 3 that Malcom X had no lasting impact on the civil rights movement. | [20] |
| Item 3: | Nathan J Robinson, a writer and commentator, and Oren Nimni, a civil rights lawyer, writing in the article "Reflections on Malcolm X" in the left-wing magazine Current Affairs (2018) |  |
| Malcolm X. | Because Malcolm died young, and did not live to build the Organization of Afro-American Unity [OAAU] into a major political force, one can look back and wonder what he stood for and what his significance was. But civil rights leaders of Malcolm's time were not wrong in pointing out that his activities had made him politically marginal, that there were not obvious material gains that can be traced to |  |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- The view expressed in Item 3 that Malcom X had no lasting impact on the civil rights movement has some credibility. As the item states, he was assassinated in 1965 and therefore failed to make the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU) a long-term success. He was politically marginal due to his confrontational style and although he had fame, he did not orchestrate significant change for African Americans.
- Malcom X's early views on black separatism and criticism of integration marginalised him, which limited his ability to work with other civil rights leaders. His association with the Nation of Islam led to many seeing him as too extreme and he alienated non-Muslims. Malcom X challenged the non-violent tactics used by Martin Luther King Jr and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), stating that African Americans should defend themselves "by any means necessary", which further alienated potential supporters.
- Item 3 is taken from a left-wing magazine which may indicate a political bias to its viewpoint. The article was written by non-specialists and does not provide detailed evidence to back up the view expressed.
- Candidates may challenge the view by emphasising other factors. For example, Malcolm X's message of black pride, self-respect and empowerment was popular with younger urban African Americans, and he established the Organization of Afro-American Unity promoting black self-reliance. His ideas influenced the Black Power movement, and he offered an alternative to Martin Luther King Jr as a civil rights leader.
- It may be argued that his alternative, militant, offering was less palatable to decision makers, which meant that presidents and government officials were more willing to work alongside more moderate activists. Faced with the potential of more radical elements gaining influence,

{31}------------------------------------------------

the demands of activists such as Martin Luther King Jr may have been met in order to avoid having to deal with demands that were seen as being too radical. It may be argued, therefore, That Malcom X, indirectly, had a significant and lasting impact. Some argue that without the alternative offered by Malcom X, there would not have been the pressure to pass civil rights legislation.

• Candidates may ultimately agree that Malcolm X had no lasting impact, or they may argue that his impact was significant in the context of his contribution to the wider Civil Rights Movement to a greater or lesser degree.
