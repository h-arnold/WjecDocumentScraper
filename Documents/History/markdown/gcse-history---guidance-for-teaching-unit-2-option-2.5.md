| Local, National & International Contexts | Studying the Third Reich (Nazi Germany from c. 1933-c. 1945) allows learners to explore international contexts by examining how global economic, political and social forces shaped and were affected by the Nazi regime. The Third Reich's rise and actions had profound international repercussions, making it a case study in the dynamics of nationalism and authoritarianism. |  |
| Relationships and Sexuality Education | Learners will consider different perspectives and experiences when examining the lives of women and children in Nazi Germany. They will consider the experiences of those persecuted, and engage with the notion of discrimination and prejudice within society. |  |
| Human Rights Education and Diversity | Considering the experiences of migrants who had to escape to Britain to avoid persecution (Kristallnacht) and utilising the Holocaust memorial website to consider the legacies of those who were targeted under the Third Reich. |  |
| Careers and Work-Related Experiences | Learners critically analyse primary and secondary sources about Nazi Germany, such as propaganda, laws and survivor testimonies. This strengthens their research and analytical skills, which are valuable in careers like law, journalism and public policy. |  |

#### **Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy**

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

#### **Examples**

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learning that statistics represent data and that probability models chance help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

# **Examples**

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

{28}------------------------------------------------

### **Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competence**

There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE History. Learners can make use of digital technology to access a broad range of historical sources and to undertake research of a historical topic. Learners will also have the opportunity to develop their digital skills in preparing and completing their non-examination assessments. These opportunities will allow learners to develop crosscurricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as allowing further access to historical information while fostering current and future critical thinking and ethical awareness.

Below are some examples of how Digital Competence can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

| Citizenship | Learners will develop an understanding of the importance of attributions, including the use of resources in digital formats such as e-books and online articles. Learners will be required to address attributions when analysing items for their historical enquiry and to think critically about the authors of digital evidence. |
