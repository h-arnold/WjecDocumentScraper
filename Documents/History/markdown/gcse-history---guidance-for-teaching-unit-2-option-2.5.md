# <span id="page-5-0"></span>Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE History consists of four units. The combination of options selected for Units 1, 2 and 3 must include one medieval, one early modern and one modern unit.

In Unit 4, centres can choose to repeat a time period previously studied in Units 1, 2 or 3. **However, the topics chosen for study in Unit 4 must not replicate or overlap with the content of any of the other selected units.**

The qualification is unitised and does not contain tiering. There is no hierarchy to the order the units should be taught.

- the economy under Schacht
- the economy under Göring and the Four-Year Plan.

Knowledge of the economy under Schacht and how this was received by the German people. This should be contrasted with the economy under Göring, and the Four-Year Plan should be examined.

### **Activities:**

- create a comparison chart showing Schacht's and Göring's approaches to economic policy
- analyse excerpts from speeches or economic policies issued under Schacht and Göring.

# **Outcome:**

Learners know the policies implemented by Schacht to reduce unemployment and how Göring's Four-Year Plan aimed to achieve autarky (self-sufficiency).

They also understand the goals of the Four-Year Plan, including military rearmament and preparing the economy for war.

#### **Advanced activities:**

Debate: Which approach (Schacht's or Göring's) was more beneficial for Nazi Germany's economy?

# **Advanced outcomes:**

Learners understand how Schacht's New Plan contrasted with Göring's more militaristic Four-Year Plan, and the significance of autarky in Nazi ideological and military goals.

#### **Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy**

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

#### **Examples**

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learning that statistics represent data and that probability models chance help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

# **Examples**

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

| Third Reich            | Refers to Nazi Germany, the regime led by Adolf Hitler from<br>1933 to 1945, which was intended as the successor to the Holy<br>Roman Empire (First Reich) and the German Empire (Second<br>Reich).                            |
| Adolf Hitler           | The leader (Führer) of the Nazi Party and dictator of Nazi<br>Germany from 1933 until his death in 1945. He played a central<br>role in the outbreak of World War II and the Holocaust.                                        |
| Aryan Race             | A key concept in Nazi ideology, referring to a so-called 'master race' of pure, non-Jewish Germans, often characterised by<br>blonde hair and blue eyes. This belief was used to justify racism<br>and anti-Semitism.          |
| Enabling Act           | A 1933 law that gave Hitler the power to pass laws without the<br>Reichstag (parliament), effectively allowing him to establish a<br>dictatorship and consolidate his control over Germany.                                    |
| Gestapo                | The official secret police of Nazi Germany, responsible for<br>rooting out opposition to the regime and enforcing Nazi policies<br>through fear and intimidation.                                                              |
| Kristallnacht          | Also known as the 'Night of Broken Glass' (9-10 November<br>1938), when Jewish homes, businesses, and synagogues were<br>attacked across Germany and Austria, marking a significant<br>escalation in Nazi persecution of Jews. |
| Lebensraum             | Literally meaning 'living space', this was a core Nazi policy<br>aimed at expanding German territory, particularly into Eastern<br>Europe, to secure resources and space for the Aryan<br>population.                          |
| Nazi Party (NSDAP)     | The National Socialist German Workers' Party, a far-right<br>political party led by Adolf Hitler, which promoted nationalism,<br>anti-Semitism and totalitarianism.                                                            |
| Nuremberg Laws         | A set of discriminatory laws passed in 1935 that stripped Jews<br>of their German citizenship, prohibited marriage between Jews<br>and non-Jews, and laid the groundwork for further persecution.                              |
| Propaganda             | A tool used extensively by the Nazi regime, particularly under Joseph Goebbels, to control public opinion through media, rallies and posters promoting Nazi ideology.                                                          |
| The Holocaust          | The systematic, state-sponsored genocide of six million Jews and millions of others including Roma, disabled individuals and political opponents, by Nazi Germany during World War II.                                         |
| The SS (Schutzstaffel) | Initially Hitler's personal bodyguard unit, the SS grew into a powerful paramilitary organisation under Heinrich Himmler, responsible for many of the atrocities committed during the Holocaust.                               |
| Weimar Republic        | The democratic government of Germany between 1919 and 1933, which faced political and economic instability. Its collapse led to the rise of the Nazi regime.                                                                   |
