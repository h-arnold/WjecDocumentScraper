- events leading to the Civil War, including:
  - arguments with Parliament over financing the war in Scotland and dealing with the 1641 revolt in Ireland
  - Parliament's treatment of some of Charles's closest advisers, including Laud and Strafford.

Charles I reluctantly calls Parliament due to lack of necessary funds to maintain an army.

On-going disagreements over Charles I collection of taxes without consent, Parliament calls for greater control over religious and political matters, the Grand Remonstrance (1641) and the Milita Bill (1642).

Charles' key advisers were targeted by Parliament as symbols of the King's unpopular policies. Opposition to Laud's religious reforms from Parliament and his impeachment, trial and execution. The Long Parliament's move against Strafford, accusation of treason, the Bill of Attainder and execution.

### Activity:

Create a timeline of the relationship between Charles I and Parliament, Charles I's personal rule and the Civil War. Include the treatment of Charles's closest advisers.

### Outcome:

Learners can describe the events involving Parliament that date from Charles' personal rule to the Civil War and describe the treatment of Charles's advisers.

### Advanced activity:

Give each key moment a rating out of 5 (0 being no tension, 5 being extremely tense). Add this to your timeline.

### Advanced outcome:

Learners can reach a judgement on the extent of tension for each key moment.

- Wales and its support for the king during the reign of Charles I, including:
  - influential Welsh men, including Sir Robert Mansel of Margam and Sir John Owen
  - the men of the Council of Wales and the Marches prior to its abolition in 1641.

Support from Welsh Royalists such as Sir Robert Mansel and Sir John Owen. Mansel provided financial and military support to the king's cause despite having direct participation in combat due to his age. Sir John Owen served as a Royalist commander in North Wales.

Lord Herbert of Chirbury remained loyal to Charles I despite being President of the Council prior to the abolition of the council.

### Activity:

Use sources to identify key Welsh supporters for Charles I. For each influential person learners should record key information such as name, age, role, military and financial importance.

### Outcome:

Learners can identify key Welsh supporters for Charles I and explain why their support was important.

### Advanced activity:

Use sources to identify key Welsh supporters for Charles I. For each influential person, learners should record key information such as name, age, role, military and financial importance. Use this to decide whether parliament or Charles I has the most effective support.

- conflicting loyalties in Wales, including:
  - Royalist gentry working for the County Committees of the Republic
  - continuing support for the Royalist cause by most people in Wales.

The County Committees were essential to implementing Commonwealth policies across Wales which had been a Royalist stronghold. These Royalists had to manage the redistribution of confiscated estates, enforce religious and social reforms and ensure Royalist sympathisers were monitored or fined. They were also responsible for collecting the decimation tax (a punitive tax imposed on former Royalists).

Support for the Royalist cause in Wales persisted despite being suppressed. Many of the Royalist gentry in Wales managed to retain a degree of influence.

### Activity:

Add columns to the table on the punishment for Royalist supporters to show how some royalist gentry worked with Cromwell after the Civil War (1.4.4).

### Outcome:

Learners can explain why and how the Royalist gentry worked for the County Committees of the Republic and describe the continued support for the Royalist cause.

### Advanced activity:

Research key Royalist gentry and identify change and continuity in their lives and status pre and postcivil war.

### Advanced outcome:

Learners can understand that the Royalist gentry in Wales managed to retain a degree of influence.
