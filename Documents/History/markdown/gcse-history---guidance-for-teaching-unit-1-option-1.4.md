## Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE History consists of four units. The combination of options selected for Units 1, 2 and 3 must include one medieval, one early modern and one modern unit.

In Unit 4, centres can choose to repeat a time period previously studied in Units 1, 2 or 3. However, the topics chosen for study in Unit 4 must not replicate or overlap with the content of any of the other selected units.

The qualification is unitised and does not contain tiering. There is no hierarchy to the order the units should be taught.

| • the religious consequences of the War in Wales, including: • the abolition of the Church of England • Puritanism and the 1650 Act to increase its influence in Wales. | To understand the impact of the abolition of the Church of England on Wales. The book of Anglican worship were banned and episcopacy (rule by bishops) was abolished.

| • how Wales was governed in the 1650s, including: • the Commonwealth for governing without a King • direct rule by Major-General Berry in Wales. | The creation of the Commonwealth following the execution of King Charles which included the abolition of the Monarchy and the House of Lords. England was declared a 'Commonwealth' under the rule of Parliament, but the true power lay with the Council of State and Oliver Cromwell. James Berry was appointed to oversee Wales. His role involved enforcing the moral and religious policies of the Puritan Commonwealth which included the collection of taxes, suppression of Royalist sympathisers and enforcement of laws against immorality such as drunkenness. | Activity: Create a timeline for the republican period from 1651-1660 to show how Wales and England were governed.

| • conflicting loyalties in Wales, including: • Royalist gentry working for the County Committees of the Republic • continuing support for the Royalist cause by most people in Wales.   | The County Committees were essential to implementing Commonwealth policies across Wales which had been a Royalist stronghold. These Royalists had to manage the redistribution of confiscated estates, enforce religious and social reforms and ensure Royalist sympathisers were monitored or fined. They were also responsible for collecting the decimation tax (a punitive tax imposed on former Royalists). Support for the Royalist cause in Wales persisted despite being suppressed. Many of the Royalist gentry in Wales managed to retain a degree of influence.   | Activity: Add columns to the table on the punishment for Royalist supporters to show how some royalist gentry worked with Cromwell after the Civil War (1.4.4). Outcome: Learners can explain why and how the Royalist gentry worked for the County Committees of the Republic and describe the continued support for the Royalist cause. Advanced activity: Research key Royalist gentry and identify change and continuity in their lives and status pre and post- civil war. Advanced outcome: Learners can understand that the Royalist gentry in Wales managed to retain a degree of influence.   | Book(s): A History of Wales 1485-1660 by Hugh Thomas, Chapter 12   | 2 hours   |

## Cross-curricular Skills - Numeracy

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learning that statistics represent data, and that probability models chance, help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

## Examples

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

## Examples

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

## Cross-curricular Skills - Digital Competence

There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE History.  Learners can make use of digital technology to access a broad range of historical sources and to undertake research of a historical topic. Learners will also have the opportunity to develop their digital skills in preparing and completing their non-examination assessments. These opportunities will allow learners to develop crosscurricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as allowing further access to historical information while fostering current and future critical thinking and ethical awareness.

Below are some examples of how Digital Competence can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

| Citizenship                   | Learners will develop an understanding of the importance of attributions, including the use of resources in digital formats such as e-books and online articles. Learners will be required to address attributions when analysing items for their historical enquiry and to think critically about the authors of digital evidence.   |

| Citizenship                   | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Citizenship                   | Learners should be made aware of copyright and plagiarism when looking at historical evidence and when developing and presenting their own arguments in relation to a topic.                                                                                                                                                          |
