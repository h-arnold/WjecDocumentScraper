## Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE History consists of four units. The combination of options selected for Units 1, 2 and 3 must include one medieval, one early modern and one modern unit.

In Unit 4, centres can choose to repeat a time period previously studied in Units 1, 2 or 3. However, the topics chosen for study in Unit 4 must not replicate or overlap with the content of any of the other selected units.

The qualification is unitised and does not contain tiering. There is no hierarchy to the order the units should be taught.

## Learning Experiences

Learners should be encouraged to consider the following learning experiences and skills to further develop their understanding, appreciation and awareness of the subject content. Information in the table below provides opportunities for teachers to integrate the learning experiences into delivery.

| Learning Experience                                                                                 | Exemplification of Learning Experience                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| participate in educational visits in person or digitally                                            | Learners could visit sites within the UK associated with the Black Death such as Comeston, South Wales and Wharram Percy, Yorkshire. There are also Black Death themed tours of London. There are also virtual tours of medieval sites of some of the European cities affected by the Black Death such as Paris and Florence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| develop empathy, tolerance, compassion and curiosity through studying different historical contexts | Learners will study about how people in Europe turned to religion to explain and protect them from the Black Death. While the trauma of the pandemic brought some people closer together, others became more isolated. There was also the scapegoating of the Jewish community in a number of cities across Europe, even in places that the plague had yet to reach. Muslim communities had a very different approach to the Black Death as they took a more practical approach to it than Christians who tended to see it in more of a religious way.                                                                |
| engage in collaborative working                                                                     | There are many examples for discussions, such as: • how someone at the time might have viewed the plague pandemic, as opposed to how we would view a pandemic now • whether the impact of the Black Death was worse in towns or in the countryside • how important religion was in people's attempts to avoid catching the Black Death • how the Black Death should be remembered in Europe. The are also opportunities for debates, such as: • how medieval transcontinental trade routes should be remembered - one side arguing the economic benefits, the other side arguing the impact of the spread of disease. |

| Local, National & International Contexts | Learners will understand that the Black Death connects villages in fourteenth century Wales to towns and villages across the rest of the British Isles, Europe, around the Mediterranean and the Near East of Asia as the rapid spread and impact of this disease made it a transcontinental pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Sustainability                           | Learners will be introduced to recent ideas, still being researched, that climate change may have influenced the spread of the Black Death. In 2.2.1, learners will explore how climate change may have influenced an increase in, and migration of, the rodent population in Asia and Europe, making it easier for the fleas carrying Black Death the spread further, faster and in greater numbers. Food shortages resulting from the end of the Medieval Warm Period may also have led to malnutrition making those of the edge of starvation more susceptible to the disease. |
| Relationships and Sexuality Education    | Learners will see that the impact of the Black Death led to conflict between the landowning aristocracy and the peasants forced to work on their land as the feudal system began to collapse. There was also a rise in antisemitic violence as a result of the Black Death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Human Rights Education and Diversity     | Learners will understand that the Black Death spread geographically, ignoring the political borders of the Mongol and Ottoman Empires, travelled through the Mamluk Empire in the Near East into North Africa, but then across the city states, empire and kingdoms of Europe. The political impact of the Black Death ignored the nature and borders of political entities in the areas affected by the Black Death. Not only did the Black Death lead to the end of feudalism in Europe but it was an important element in ending the power of the Mongol Empire as well.       |



{43}------------------------------------------------



| Careers and Work-Related Experiences   | Learners will understand the economic importance of the merchants of the Silk Road and the Mediterranean Sea routes in this period, although they are no longer important in the modern world. They will also see how the medical profession was much less professional, and much less based in science in the medieval period. Learners will also understand that the priests who worked for the Church in Europe were much more important in medieval times than they are today. It was through them that the Christians of Europe came to see the Black Death as a religious rather than natural phenomenon.   |

## Cross-curricular Skills - Numeracy

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learning that statistics represent data and that probability models chance help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

## Examples

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

## Examples

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

## Cross-curricular Skills - Digital Competence

There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE History.  Learners can make use of digital technology to access a broad range of historical sources and to undertake research of a historical topic. Learners will also have the opportunity to develop their digital skills in preparing and completing their non-examination assessments. These opportunities will allow learners to develop crosscurricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as allowing further access to historical information while fostering current and future critical thinking and ethical awareness.

Below are some examples of how Digital Competence can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

| Citizenship                   | Learners will develop an understanding of the importance of attributions, including the use of resources in digital formats such as e-books and online articles. Learners will be required to address attributions when analysing items for their historical enquiry and to think critically about the authors of digital evidence.   |
