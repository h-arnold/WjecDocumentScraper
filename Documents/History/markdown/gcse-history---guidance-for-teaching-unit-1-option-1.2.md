## Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE History consists of four units. The combination of options selected for Units 1, 2 and 3 must include one medieval, one early modern and one modern unit.

In Unit 4, centres can choose to repeat a time period previously studied in Units 1, 2 or 3. However, the topics chosen for study in Unit 4 must not replicate or overlap with the content of any of the other selected units.

The qualification is unitised and does not contain tiering. There is no hierarchy to the order the units should be taught.

The are also opportunities for debates, such as: • the extent to which Wales in this period was influenced by England, with one side arguing it was greatly influenced by England and the other side that it was not. |

| Local, National & International Contexts            | Unit 1 provides centres with six different historical topics relating to the history of a range of areas within Wales, allowing local or national contexts to be explored with learners. Option 1.2 Medieval: Owain Glyndwr, c.1354 - 1416 allows centres and learners to explore medieval history within North Wales. There are a number of locations in North Wales associated with Owain Glyndwr including Harlech Castle which the centre of his government, but also Conwy Castle which his supporters took from the English early in the revolt. In northeastern Wales, there are a number of sites associated with Glyndwr including St. Chad's church in Hanmer and there is also the Parliament in Machynlleth, Mid Wales. |
| Relationships and Sexuality Education               | This unit considers the perspective of the Welsh, after their resentment towards the English, as a result of being treated as second class citizens since the Edwardian Conquest. Learners will explore the reasons behind support for Glyndwr's Welsh Revolt, including the lack of opportunities for Welsh people, events that increased support in Wales for the revolt and the impact of Henry IV's penal laws                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Human Rights Education and Diversity                | Wales had been colonised by the English after being conquered in the 13 th century. By the late 14 th century, the English were acting as a colonial power in Wales, treating the native Welsh as if they were second class citizens in their own country. Learners will explore the significance of the Edwardian settlement, as well as Welsh rebellions against English rule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Careers and Work-Related Experiences                | Most of the military roles in the medieval warfare covered by this unit are no longer part of the work done by people in the armed forces today. Owain Glyndwr's role as a squire, with the aim of eventually becoming a knight is very different to the aspirations of people in Wales today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Cross-curricular Skills - Numeracy

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History:

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learning that statistics represent data, and that probability models chance, help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

## Examples

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

## Examples

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

| Creativity and Innovation             | There are many opportunities to include Creativity and Innovation in GCSE History. These opportunities are important to learners to become more engaged in lessons and enjoy learning through stimulating tasks. Deeper understanding is developed through the encouragement for learners to take an active role in their learning. Examples • Learners will demonstrate creativity when developing responses, expressing their opinions about relevant historical issues and critically evaluating sources and evidence within assessments. • Learners have opportunities to be creative and innovative when presenting information and findings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Critical Thinking and Problem Solving | There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE History.

This skill can be applied to real-life scenarios. Examples • Learners will have opportunities to ask meaningful questions of source material and historical interpretations, as well as to evaluate them as part of their process of developing relevant critical arguments. • Learners will develop their ability to see issues from multiple viewpoints. • Studying continuity and change over time allows learners to develop their problem-solving skills that can be applied in their future lives. • Learners will evaluate sources and historical interpretations in terms of reliability, bias and purpose. • Critical thinking and problem solving encourages independent learning and promotes the ability to come to reasoned and informed decisions in other aspects of life such as further education or work. |
| Planning and Organisation             | There are many opportunities to include Planning and Organisation in GCSE History.
