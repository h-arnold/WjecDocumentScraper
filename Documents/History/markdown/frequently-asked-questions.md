## GCSE HISTORY - UNIT 2 NEA ON-SCREEN ASSESSMENT

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### 1. What is e-assessment/on-screen assessment?

E-assessment/on-screen assessment involves the use of ICT; allowing the completion and marking of NEA or examinations on-screen, removing the need for pen and paper.

### 2. What units will be delivered via on-screen assessment for GCSE History?

For our new GCSE History (for first teaching from September 2026), our Unit 2 NEA (non-examination assessment) will be delivered on-screen.

### 3. Why are we introducing this change?

As part of their regulatory conditions, Qualifications Wales require that a proportion of all Humanities GCSEs are assessed on-screen within the first five years of teaching.

To meet this requirement, we have taken the decision to introduce this to our NEA for Unit 2 in GCSE History from the start of the new qualification as we felt that on-screen assessment would benefit this particular Unit. Please note, this only applies to the new specification.

### 4. When is the first on-screen assessment for Unit 2 NEA?

The first assessment window will take place from January to March 2027.

### 5. How will NEA be delivered on-screen?

Centres will be given a 12-week window to deliver the 3-hour assessment. The assessment can be completed in a single session, or multiple, shorter sessions. Further guidance will be issued in due course.

### 6. Will learners have the opportunity to practice e-assessments?

E-assessment sample assessment materials will be available on our Surpass platform, from December 2024. This will enable learners, and schools/colleges, to familiarise themselves with our on-screen assessments. In addition, past assessments will also be available following each examination series.

#### 7. Are e-assessments accessible to all learners?

Our e-assessments have been designed with learners' accessibility in mind. All learners will be able to access our e-assessments without special arrangements. However, where accessible versions are required, our assessments are devised to work with a wide range of commonly used access technologies and access arrangements.

# 8. What support/guidance will WJEC offer in the delivery of e-assessments?

We have over 15 years' experience in the development and delivery of eassessments for a variety of general and vocational qualifications. Our specialist e-assessment team offers free comprehensive support to enable schools/colleges to deliver these assessments with confidence.

# 9. How can I deliver e-assessment within my school/college?
