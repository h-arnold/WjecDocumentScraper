**Theme** International relations

**Topic** The Anglo-Saxon succession

**Item 1** A blog entry entitled 'The death of Edward the Confessor and the

conflicting claims to the English Crown' on the website of the British

Government (2016)

Edward was the eldest son of King Æthelred ('the Unready') from his second marriage to Emma, the sister of Duke Richard II of Normandy. This marriage had been arranged as part of Aethelred's attempts to improve English relations with Normandy. But Æthelred had sons from his first marriage, and when he died in 1016, he did so in the midst of a battle for the throne between his eldest surviving son, Edmund Ironside, and Cnut the Great of Denmark. Edmund though died shortly afterwards, and at his death, Cnut succeeded to the kingdom of England.

At Cnut's death, another succession dispute erupted between the sons of Cnut's first wife, Æflgifyu of Northampton, and those of his second wife, Æthelred's widow, Emma. In that dispute, Edward's brother, Alfred, was murdered, perhaps at the instigation of Emma. Only after seven long years did Edward eventually succeed to the kingdom of England in 1042, putting the line of Wessex back on the English throne.

**Theme** International relations

**Topic** The Anglo-Saxon succession

**Item 2** William of Poitiers, the chaplain of Duke William II of Normandy (William I of

England) in his *History of William the Conqueror* (c.1073).

King Edward loved William like a brother … and had promised he would be the next king of England. He sent Harold over to Duke William to repeat the promise … Harold swore an oath to be loyal and obedient to William. This solemn promise was made in the usual sacred Christian way.

**Theme** International relations **Topic** The Anglo-Saxon succession

**Item 4** Malcom Barber, a professor of History, outlines Harold Godwinson's actions between 1064 and 1066 (1992)

Whatever his previous plans, in 1064 Harold found himself pushed towards the Norman succession. Probably in that year he set out to cross the channel. The reasons for this journey are not known for certain, but most historians have assumed that he was sent by Edward to confirm William's succession, and that he had, by this time, accepted it as inevitable. If this is so, he arrived in Normandy by a circuitous route since, apparently because of adverse weather, he landed in Ponthieu, was captured by Count Guy, and then ransomed. Once in Normandy he took an oath of fealty to William and apparently agreed to do all in his power to establish William on the throne after Edward's death. These curious events meant that, when Edward died in January 1066, both Harold and William could put their own construction on them, for Harold could argue that promises had been made under compulsion, while William could allege that Harold's seizure of the throne was the act of a perjurer. William's version was more widely accepted, partly because he was represented at the papal court and Harold was not.

Moreover, as Harold must have been acutely aware, William was not the only other claimant. On 20 September 1066 a great army led by Harald Hardrada, king of Norway, and Tostig, the deposed Earl of Northumbria and Harold's own brother, defeated an English army near York and took the city. Harald Hardrada claimed the throne on the basis of an agreement with Harthacnut, Cnut's son and successor in England until his death in 1042, and Magnus, King of Norway, who died in 1047. Harold therefore marched north, although he knew very well that William was only awaiting a favourable opportunity to invade in the South.

{6}------------------------------------------------

**Theme** Equality and Inequality **Topic** The Feudal System

**Item 5** A description of the feudal system in the textbook *The Medieval Realms* 

(1991)

Once William had become King of England, he had to decide how he was going to govern the country. He didn't want the old English nobles to keep their estates, because they would be too powerful and might try to overthrow him. Anyway, they had to make room for William's supporters who had been promised land in return for helping him.

William was very careful not to just give land away. His supporters were rewarded, but they had duties to perform as well. This system of duties and rewards was called the feudal system. In Normandy when barons or bishops were given land, they had to swear an oath of loyalty to the Lord who's given it. This was called doing homage. The barons or bishops then became tenants-in-chief and agreed to provide knights to guard castles or fight in wars for their lords. The more land the Baron was given the more knights he had to provide.

**Theme** Equality and Inequality **Topic** The Feudal System

**Item 6** 'The Rime of King William', the 1087 entry of the *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle*,

copied into the Peterborough Chronicle in the early twelfth century.

He ordered the poor to build castles.

This was very hard work.

The king was a tough man

And he took many gold coins from his people

And many more hundreds of pounds in silver …

This was most unfair, and he did not really need the money …

He marked out a huge area for deer, and made laws about it.

Anyone who killed a hart or a hind

Was to be blinded …

He loved the stags as dearly

As though he had been their father …

The rich complained and the poor wept,

But he was too merciless to care if everyone hated him,

And they just had to obey him.

Otherwise, they lost their lives in their lands

And their goods and their king's friendship.

**Theme** Equality and Inequality **Topic** The Feudal System

**Item 7** An extract from the history website *Medieval Chronicles*

[www.medievalchronicles.com], explaining the origins of feudalism in

Europe and its spread into England in the eleventh century.

Feudalism in Europe emerged somewhere around the ninth century and continued to exist as a dominant social structure until the fifteenth century. It began when mounted soldiers started establishing landholdings of their own, essentially a result of the decentralization of the power in the Empires. This led to vast land holdings in the hands of these soldiers who eventually became the nobility, and the land was further subdivided into smaller land holdings which were called 'fiefs'.

Feudalism in Western Europe arose in the area under the Frankish Empire during the ninth and tenth centuries. It arose because after Frankish armies and soldiers settled down, they were able to secure landholdings. Since previous social structures as were present during the Roman era had crumbled in Western Europe, feudalism emerged as a viable alternative for the new social circumstances. This is why it rapidly spread to other parts of Europe as well.

Feudalism was brought to England by the French Duke of Normandy after his Norman conquest in 1066. After the invasion, William replaced the prevalent Anglo-Saxon aristocracy with a Norman-French nobility and this nobility began using feudal practices. After the conquest, William had claimed all of the lands in England and then divided it between his own soldiers and barons. In the feudal set-up, peasants were given land holdings that they could cultivate and live on in return for the provided labour to landowners.

**Topic** Anglo-Saxon resistance to Norman rule, 1067–1070

**Item 9** An extract from the historical novel *Hereward, Last of the English* by Charles Kingsley, an Anglican priest, historian and novelist (1866)

When the men of Wessex, the once conquering race of Britain, fell at Hastings once and for all, and struck no second blow, then the men of the Danelaw disdained to yield to the Norman invader. For seven long years they held their own, not knowing, like true Englishmen, when they were beaten; and fought on desperate, till there were none left to fight. Their bones lay white on every island in the fens; their corpses rotted on gallows beneath every Norman keep; their few survivors crawled into monasteries, with eyes picked out, or hands and feet cut off, or took to the wild wood as strong outlaws. But they never really bent their necks to the Norman yoke; they kept alive in their hearts that proud spirit of personal independence.

**Theme** Peace and conflict

**Topic** Anglo-Saxon resistance to Norman rule, 1067–1070

**Item 10** An extract from Part 5 of the *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle*, 1052–1069.

A.D. 1067. This year came the king back again to England on St Nicholas's day; and the same day was burned the church of Christ at Canterbury. Bishop Wulfwy also died, and is buried at his see in Dorchester. The child Edric and the Britons were unsettled this year, and fought with the castlemen at Hereford, and did them much harm. The king this year imposed a heavy guild on the wretched people; but, notwithstanding, let his men always plunder all the country that they went over; and then he marched to Devonshire, and beset the city of Exeter eighteen days. There were many of his army slain; out he had promised them well, and performed ill; and the citizens surrendered the city because the thanes had betrayed them. This summer the child Edgar departed, with his mother Agatha, and his two sisters, Margaret and Christina, and Merle-Sweyne, and many good men with them; and came to Scotland under the protection of King Malcolm, who entertained them all.

**Item 12** An account of the resistance to Norman rule by the English Monk and Historian, Orderic Vitalis, in his chronicle *Historia Ecclesiastica* [History of the Church] (1141).

The fortifications called castles by the Normans were scarcely known in England and so the English – in spite of that courage and love of fighting – could put up only weak resistance to their enemies.

**Theme** Culture

**Topic** The development of castles

**Item 13** An extract from the Second Continuation of the Peterborough Chronicle (1132–1154).

1137 When the King Stephen came to England, he held his council at Oxford; and there he seized the Bishop, Roger, of Salisbury, and Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, and the chancellor Roger, his nephew; and threw them all into prison until they gave up their castles. But when these nobles, supporters of Matilda, understood that Stephen was a mild man, and soft, and good, and did not execute harsh justice they became forgetful of their pledge to him. They filled the land full of castles and they cruelly oppressed the wretched men of the land with castle building, and when the castles were made, they filled them with devils and evil men. Then took they those who they thought had any goods, both by night and by day, and threw them into prison for their gold and silver. Never were any martyrs tortured as they were. Some were hung by the feet and smoked with foul smoke. Some were hung by their thumbs, others by their head, with coats of mail hung on their feet. They tied knotted strings about their heads and twisted them till they went to their brains. They threw them into dungeons that had snakes and toads and so killed them. Some they placed in a chest that was short and narrow and undeep and put sharp stones in and crushed the man inside and broke all his limbs. In many of the castles were heavy shackles – fetters and nooses – that were so heavy two or three men could only just carry one. They were fastened to a beam; and a sharp iron was placed around the man's throat and neck, so that he could turn in no direction, not sit, not lie, not sleep, just bear all that weight. Many thousands they killed with hunger. I cannot nor may I tell all the horrors and all the pains inflicted on the wretched men in this land. This lasted for nineteen winters while Stephen was king, and ever it grew worse and worse.

**Item 16** A description of the building of square keep castles in the textbook *The* 

*Medieval Realms* (1991).

Motte and bailey castles had weaknesses. They were built out of wood, which rotted easily and could be set on fire by enemy soldiers. They were also cramped, drafty and uncomfortable. Since the beginning of the conquest the Normans had built some important castles, like the White Tower in London, out of stone. After 1100, many more stone castles were built and they were usually square in shape

**Theme** Ethnicity

**Topic** Jewish settlement after the Norman Conquest

**Item 17** An article entitled 'England's Jewish Population' introducing visitors to

Clifford's Tower, York on the *English Heritage* website (early twenty-first

century)

After the Norman Conquest of 1066, a number of Jews came to England from Rouen in France. The early Norman kings needed to borrow money to build castles and secure their kingdom, but money-lending was forbidden to Christians. It was, however, permitted to Jews. These French-speaking Jews were protected by the Crown, and in time established communities in most of the principal cities of England. In the later 12th century, members of the Jewish community in Lincoln settled in York.

However, there was growing hostility towards the Jewish population in England. This was in part due to public disagreements in theology between Jewish scholars and Christian churchmen. In the mid-12th century several vicious stories were spread accusing Jews of murdering Christian children. Such slanders, now known as the 'Blood Libel', strengthened anti-Semitic sentiment in England.

**Item 19** An account of the alleged killing by Jews of William of Norwich, a twelveyear-old apprentice in Norwich in 1144. The account was written by the monk, Thomas of Monmouth, in his biography *The Life and Miracles of St William of Norwich*, sometime between 1149 and 1172.

But on the next day, which in that year was the Passover for them, after the singing of the hymns appointed for the day in the synagogue, the chiefs of the Jews assembled in the House of the Jew aforesaid suddenly seized hold of the boy William as he was having his dinner and in no fear of any treachery, and ill treated him in various horrible ways. For a while some of them held him behind, others opened his mouth and introduced an instrument of torture which is called a teazle, and, fixing it by straps through both jaws to the back of his neck, they fastened it with a knot as tightly as it could be drawn. After that taking a short piece of rope of about the thickness of one's little finger and tying 3 knots in it at certain distances marked out, they bound round that innocent head with it from the forehead to the back, forcing the middle not into his forehead and the two others into his temples, the two ends of the rope being most tightly stretched at the back of his head and fastened in a very tight knot. The end of the rope were then passed round his neck and carried round his throat and his chin, and there they finished off this dreadful engine of torture in a fifth knot …

Having shaved his head, they stabbed it with countless thorn points, and made the blood come horribly from the wounds they made … Some of those present adjudged him to be fixed to a cross in mockery of the Lord's passion, as though they would say "Even as we condemned the Christ to a shameful death so let us condemn the Christian".

Lanfranc had been elected to the Archbishopric of Rouen in 1067, but had declined it; now, however, the Conqueror fixed on Lanfranc as his choice of a successor to Stigand (Archbishop of Canterbury from 1052 until 1070) … [He] was consecrated at Canterbury on 29 August, by the Bishop of London. He entered on the duties of his high station with advantages of name and learning and experience of the world such as few men have ever brought to a similar office. The king's ecclesiastical policy, which he now, as chief counsellor, largely moulded, was without doubt beneficial to the kingdom; for the civil and ecclesiastical courts were separated, and regular synods were held, wherein regulations tending to better discipline were enacted and enforced. The Normanizing of the Church further tended to bring the native ecclesiastics into closer touch with the learning and practice of the Continent; and this was affected by replacing nearly all the Saxon bishops and abbots with Normans, on pretexts grave or slight. Whilst the insularity of the native clergy was thus beneficially broken down, much on the other hand of local practice, laudable in itself, was swept away.

The Anglo-Saxon saints, like the Anglo-Saxons as a whole, once seemed to have suffered immensely because of the Norman Conquest. Respected historians, among them David Knowles and Frank Stenton, left colorful images in the historical imagination of bigoted Norman churchmen treating with contempt the old English saints who rested in the communities over which they took charge. But now, in large part because of the work of Susan Ridyard (a professor of medieval British and European History), our perceptions have altered dramatically. Norman churchmen now appear to have accepted readily, rather than to have condemned suspiciously, their new saints.

**Item 26** A *BBC Bitesize* video explaining why William needed Domesday Book

(early twenty-first century)

How successful William's conquest of England had been was revealed in a survey, conducted in 1086.

With the constant threat of rebellion, he needed to know how much tax he could raise to fund an army. Norman commissioners held public inquests in towns and villages right across England. They questioned who held the land now, and who had owned it in 1066. They wanted to know everything, from how many freemen and slaves there were, to how many ploughs and pigs.

The English people called it the Domesday Book, the day of judgment. It revealed William possessed about 20% of the wealth of England, his barons 50%, and the Church had 25%. The surviving English nobles had a meagre 5%.

The Anglo-Saxons had been totally overpowered. William had conquered, and secured the power of England, and the Normans had completely taken over.

(2023)

Domesday book – a snapshot of England at the moment of Williams invasion – listed 16 667 male landowners and 479 women. Among these were some extremely wealthy women: Gytha Thorkilsdottir, Countess of Wessex, mother of King Harold, owned massive estates in southern England stretching over 11 modern counties. Harold's influential and wealthy wife Edith Swan Neck held vast lands. Two of the greatest women landowners of 1086 were not even named in Domesday Book – they are referred to as the *wife* of Hugh, son of Grip, and the *mother* of Robert Malet.

A woman named Asa, a small landowner in Yorkshire, appeared in the Domesday records claiming her lands after separating from her husband. The jury in the case followed the old Anglo-Saxon law: Asa won and held her land in her own right. She was lucky to come under Anglo-Saxon law – the new Norman laws would rule that no wife could own land or keep it after marriage without a specific settlement. No woman would another marriage or divorce without permission from the church courts or parliament for the next eight centuries.

After the decisive battle of Tinchebrai in 1106 in Normandy, Henry completed his conquest of Normandy from Robert, who then (unusually even for that time) spent the last 28 years of his life as his brother's prisoner in various castles in England and Wales.

An energetic, decisive and occasionally cruel ruler, Henry centralised the administration of England and Normandy in the royal court, using 'viceroys' in Normandy and a group of advisers in England to act on his behalf when he was absent across the Channel.

Some of Henry's contemporaries levied accusations of avarice, cruelty and severity against him. Seeing Henry as having failed to honour his oath to maintain good laws and to abolish all iniquities throughout his kingdom, the chronicler John of Worcester recounted a series of dreams Henry experienced in 1130. The three broad classes of society (peasants, knights and clerics) visited Henry successively. Each group in turn threatened Henry with weapons appropriate to their position, the peasants with their scythes and spades, the knights armed with their swords and shields, and the clerics with their croziers. Shortly after these terrifying nightmares, Henry was caught in a storm at sea which only abated once he made three promises: not to collect the Danish tax for 7 years, to go on pilgrimage to Bury St Edmunds, and always to preserve justice throughout England.

(2023)

Matilda was the first Norman woman to inherit the English throne, and forced be the first queen militant – raising her own army and leading into battle for two years of skirmishes, until her victory at the Battle of Lincoln in 1141. She imprisoned the pretender Stephen and ignored a demand from his wife, Queen Matilda of Boulogne. Matilda of Boulogne then mustered her own army to plunder the country around London, persuading Londoners to ally with her against the empress, who moved her forces to Winchester and besieged the bishop's castle. Matilda of Boulogne pursued Empress Matilda and defeated her. For six years Empress Matilda led her own troops, her own vassals and knights, and paid mercenaries to follow her into battle. Eventually Steven acknowledged his defeat and made peace, but even then he did not hand over the throne. He named Matilda son as heir, and the boy became Henry II.

back to England from Normandy, by the English Monk and Historian, Orderic Vitalis, in his chronicle *Historia Ecclesiastica* [History of the Church]

(1141)

Two planks were shattered by the crash and the ship, alas! filled and went down. At this fearful moment the passengers and crew raised cries of distress but their mouths were soon stopped by the swelling waves and all perished together, except two who seized hold of the yard from which the sale was set …

Thomas, the master of the vessel, managed to recover his senses after his first plunge into the sea and raising his head above the water he cried out, "What has become of the King's son?" The two men clinging to the yard-arm replied that he and all the others had perished. "Then," said Thomas, "it is misery for me to live any longer." And he abandoned himself to his fate in utter despair, preferring to meet it at once rather than face the rage of the king or drag out his days in a dungeon …

A nun who left the convent of Wilton to get married was Matilda. She was a great-greatgreat granddaughter of Æthelred. Matilda had been taken to Wilton by her aunt. She hated it: "as soon as I was able to escape out of my aunt's presence I tore the nun's veil from my face and threw it on the ground and trampled on it". Whom did she marry? Henry I, of England William the Conqueror's youngest son. The wedding was soon seen as a sign of peace between the English and their new Norman rulers.

Matilda's marriage was front page news. But the fact is that every marriage between a Norman and an Englishwoman was important. It was these marriages which kept English alive as a language. Children learn how to speak, not from their fathers but from their mothers and from other women who looked after them. So they tended to learn English from their English mothers.
