|  | Unit 3 provides centres with six different historical topics relating to world history. The optional topics provide opportunities to enhance learners' understanding of the world and the diverse experiences of its people. Options allow for the study of marginalised regions of the world, the histories of dispossessed peoples and forgotten empires, especially of the global South. |  |  |
| Local, National & International Contexts | Option 3.6 Changes in US society, c.1880 – c.1980 allows centres and learners to explore early modern history within North America. This period sees significant developments in racial equality in the USA, focusing on how racial discrimination and intolerance was confronted and combated and the extent of resistance to progress. It covers the territorial dispossession of Indigenous Peoples and the conscious attempt to eradicate their cultural heritage as well as attempts to make amends. The experience of immigrant communities is also present. |  |  |
| Human Rights Education and Diversity | The Unit specifically covers the Civil Rights movement in the USA and the struggle of African Americans for social economic and political equality. It covers cultural developments - both positive and negative - in the experiences of African Americans and Indigenous Peoples (also referred to in legislation documents and resources as "Native Americans" or "American Indians". The unit also focuses on the issue of women's rights. |  |  |

#### **Cross-curricular Skills - Literacy**

There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE History. These opportunities include the analysis of source material, extended writing opportunities, vocabulary development, debating and discussion. These opportunities are important to learners because they will develop cross-curricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as communication skills which can be used across subjects and prepare them for future education or employment.

Below are some examples of how Literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

#### **Cross-curricular Skills - Numeracy**

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

#### **Examples**

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications .

Learning that statistics represent data and that probability models chance help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

#### **Examples**

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.
