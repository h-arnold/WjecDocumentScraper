- why Süleyman has been regarded as a significant ruler, including:
  - the reasons why he is known as Süleyman the lawgiver, and criticisms of that title
  - the reasons why he is known as Süleyman the Magnificent, and criticisms of that title.

Opposing views on Süleyman as a lawgiver and as magnificent.

#### **Activity:**

Divide learners into the following four sections (without knowing) and give supporting documents:

- information to show Süleyman as a lawgiver
- information that counteracts Süleyman as a lawgiver
- information to show Süleyman as magnificent
- information that counteracts Süleyman as magnificent.

Learners will collate the information they have been given to make their own conclusions (these should be biased toward one view or the other). Learners will then debate what Süleyman's title should be. Learners will then go on to swap information with the opposing views to have an objective view of Süleyman.

### **Outcome:**

Learners can demonstrate that they understand why Süleyman was known as the lawgiver and why he is known as magnificent.

#### **Advanced activity:**

Provide a written summary on the terms of lawgiver and magnificent, with a conclusion on the use of both titles.

#### **Cross-curricular Skills - Numeracy**

There are many opportunities to include numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

#### **Examples**

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learning that statistics represent data and that probability models chance help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

#### **Examples**

# **Integral Skills** Creativity and Innovation There are many opportunities to include creativity and innovation in GCSE History. These opportunities are important to learners to become more engaged in lessons and enjoy learning through stimulating tasks. Deeper understanding is developed through the encouragement for learners to take an active role in their learning. **Examples** • Learners will demonstrate creativity when developing responses, expressing their opinions about relevant historical issues and critically evaluating sources and evidence within assessments. • Learners have opportunities to be creative and innovative when presenting information and findings. Critical Thinking and Problem Solving There are many opportunities to include critical thinking and problem solving in GCSE History. These opportunities are important to learners because they develop the ability to think analytically, and to collect, reflect and critically evaluate evidence in order to make informed judgements on a range of topics. This skill can be applied to real-life scenarios. **Examples** • Learners will have opportunities to ask meaningful questions of source material and historical interpretations, as well as to evaluate them as part of their process of developing relevant critical arguments. • Learners will develop their ability to see issues from multiple viewpoints. • Studying continuity and change over time allows learners to develop their problem-solving skills that can be applied in their future lives. • Learners will evaluate sources and historical interpretations in terms of reliability, bias and purpose. • Critical thinking and problem solving encourages independent learning and promotes the ability to come to

reasoned and informed decisions in other aspects of life such as further education or work.

{34}------------------------------------------------
