Learning Experiences

Learners should be encouraged to consider the following learning experiences and skills to
further develop their understanding, appreciation and awareness of the subject content.
Information in the table below provides opportunities for teachers to integrate the learning
experiences into delivery.

Learning Experience

Exemplification of Learning Experience

Participate in educational visits in
person or digitally

Develop empathy, tolerance,
compassion and curiosity through
studying different historical contexts

Engage in collaborative working

Learners could visit the monastery in Lindisfarne
to learn of the impact of the Viking raid there, or
the Viking sites on the Orkney and Shetland
islands. Learners could also visit the Jorvik centre
in York to learn more about life in Viking Britain.

Studying Viking religious beliefs and their eventual
conversion to Christianity shows how their
tolerance and self-reflection developed. Their
violent raids were preceded and followed by
periods of peaceful living and eventual assimilation
into local populations in France, Britain and
Ireland.

There are many examples for discussions, such
as:
•  which was more important in the life of the

Vikings – their ships or their gods?

•  how successful Cnut was as a ruler compared

to Svein Forkbeard.

The are also opportunities for debates, such as:
•  Did the Vikings gain more from the Byzantine

Empire than the Byzantine Empire gained from
the Vikings?

•  Were the Vikings finally defeated at the battle
of Clontarf in 1014, or did they disappear as a
separate group having become assimilated
into Irish society?

•  How much were the Vikings changed by

Bluetooth’s reign, with one side arguing that
the changes were significant, and the other
side arguing they were superficial?

Cross-cutting Themes

Local, National &
International Contexts

Unit 3 provides centres with six different historical topics relating to world history. The optional topics provide
opportunities to enhance learners’ understanding of the world and the diverse experiences of its peoples. Options
allow for the study of marginalised regions of the world, the histories of dispossessed peoples and forgotten
empires, especially of the global South.

Option 3.1 Medieval: The Vikings, c.750 – c.1066 allows centres and learners to explore medieval history within
Northern Europe and the Atlantic. Viking raids within Britain involve locations from Lindisfarne to Sheppey in
eastern England, as well as the Orkney and Shetland islands in Scotland and across the Irish Sea in Ireland.
However, these national connections are then linked into Scandinavia as well as raids in Europe on France and
Spain, trading through what is now modern Russia and Ukraine, the Byzantine Empire and the Muslim trading
networks centred around Baghdad.

Sustainability

Learners will understand that the lifestyle of the Vikings was shaped by the environment of Scandinavia, but also
that climate change influenced their exploration as the medieval warm period reduced the sea ice in the northern
Atlantic and kept the rivers of eastern Europe navigable through the winter.

Relationships and
Sexuality Education

This unit considers the perspective of the Vikings, but also those from a diverse range of other societies they
interacted with.

There are a wide range of perspectives on the Vikings and judgements about them from Europeans such as the
English and the Irish, but also the Muslim societies and the Byzantine Empire in the Near East. The unit
challenges the stereotype of the Vikings as violent barbarians.

GCSE History Guidance for Teaching, Unit 3 Option 3.1: The Vikings c.750 – c.1066  34

Learners will understand that slavery existed within Viking society, but also that the Vikings had positive
relationship with a wide range of different peoples from the Irish in the west to the Arabs in the east. There was
also a relatively short-lived Viking Empire around the North Sea that had originated from Denmark.

Human Rights
Education and Diversity

Viking settlements in Ireland, England in the Danelaw, Scotland and northern France were examples of
colonialism, while wars of conquest like those by Sveyn Forkbeard in England were imperial in nature.

The unit explores Viking society, and how the thralls were the slaves within Viking society, born to slave parents,
captured in war or enslaved to pay debts.

Careers and Work-
Related Experiences

Learners will understand that there were lots of job opportunities for the peoples of the British Isles in the medieval
period, although those jobs have largely disappeared now and are not usually an aspiration for people living in
modern Britain.

There are many opportunities to include numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in
primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These
opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidence-
based conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy

Below are some examples of how numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry
helps us understand
shape, space and position
and learning about
measurement helps us
quantify in the real world

Learning that statistics
represent data, and that
probability models
chance, help us make
informed inferences and
decisions

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of
empires or the geographical representation of wars.

Examples

•  Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
•  Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
•  There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

Examples

•  Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land

expansion.

•  Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
•  There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

GCSE History Guidance for Teaching, Unit 3 Option 3.1: The Vikings c.750 – c.1066  38

Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competence

There are many opportunities to include digital competence in GCSE History. Learners can make use of digital technology to access a broad
range of historical sources and to undertake research of a historical topic. Learners will also have the opportunity to develop their digital
skills in preparing and completing their non-examination assessments. These opportunities will allow Learners to develop cross-curricular
skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as allowing further access to historical information while fostering current
and future critical thinking and ethical awareness.
Below are some examples of how digital competence can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learners will develop an understanding of the importance of attributions, including the use of resources in digital
formats such as e-books and online articles. Learners will be required to address attributions when analysing
items for their historical enquiry and to think critically about the authors of digital evidence.

Citizenship

Example

Learners should be made aware of copyright and plagiarism when looking at historical evidence and when
developing and presenting their own arguments in relation to a topic.

Interacting and
Collaborating

Learners can work collaboratively (digitally) on tasks in preparation for the exam. These could include peer
assessment, responding to teacher feedback or work creation.

Example

In groups, learners could research and present a topic to introduce an area of study.

Producing

Example

Learners have opportunities to research a variety of sources digitally.

•  Use of national and international archives to find source materials that link to the area of study.

historical issues and critically evaluating sources and evidence within assessments.

•  Learners have opportunities to be creative and innovative when presenting information and findings.

There are many opportunities to include critical thinking and problem solving in GCSE History. These
opportunities are important to Learners because they develop the ability to think analytically, and to collect,
reflect and critically evaluate evidence in order to make informed judgements on a range of topics. This skill can
be applied to real-life scenarios.

Examples

Critical Thinking and
Problem Solving

•  Learners will have opportunities to ask meaningful questions of source material and historical

interpretations, as well as to evaluate them as part of their process of developing relevant critical
arguments.

•  Learners will develop their ability to see issues from multiple viewpoints.
•  Studying continuity and change over time allows learners to develop their problem-solving skills that can be

applied in their future lives.

•  Learners will evaluate sources and historical interpretations in terms of reliability, bias and purpose.
•  Critical thinking and problem solving encourages independent learning and promotes the ability to come to

reasoned and informed decisions in other aspects of life such as further education or work.
