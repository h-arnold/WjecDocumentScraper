• the nature of Viking society and Viking beliefs.

Viking life, including, houses, clothes and food.

The structure of Viking society, including thralls, bondi and jarls.

The role of women in Viking society.

The importance of ships and sea-faring to the Vikings.

#### **Activities:**

- Draw a diagram to illustrate the hierarchy of Viking society.
- Divide the learners into groups – each group to focus on researching either Viking life, the role of women, the importance of the sea or Viking religion. After the research, reorganise groups so that there is at least one learner from each of the original groups to share information, so all learners end up with all of the information.

#### **Outcome:**

Learners can show their understanding of Viking society as well as the main beliefs of the Viking religion.

#### **Advanced activity:**

Learners could discuss which was more important in the life of the Vikings – their ships or their gods.

#### **Advanced outcome:**

Learners can draw conclusions about the extent to which Viking society was religious.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Participate in educational visits in person or digitally | Learners could visit the monastery in Lindisfarne to learn of the impact of the Viking raid there, or the Viking sites on the Orkney and Shetland islands. Learners could also visit the Jorvik centre in York to learn more about life in Viking Britain. |
| Develop empathy, tolerance, compassion and curiosity through studying different historical contexts | Studying Viking religious beliefs and their eventual conversion to Christianity shows how their tolerance and self-reflection developed. Their violent raids were preceded and followed by periods of peaceful living and eventual assimilation into local populations in France, Britain and Ireland. |
| Engage in collaborative working | There are many examples for discussions, such as: <ul><li>which was more important in the life of the Vikings – their ships or their gods?</li><li>how successful Cnut was as a ruler compared to Svein Forkbeard. The are also opportunities for debates, such as:</li><li>Did the Vikings gain more from the Byzantine Empire than the Byzantine Empire gained from the Vikings?</li><li>Were the Vikings finally defeated at the battle of Clontarf in 1014, or did they disappear as a separate group having become assimilated into Irish society?</li><li>How much were the Vikings changed by Bluetooth's reign, with one side arguing that the changes were significant, and the other side arguing they were superficial?</li></ul> |

| Local, National & International Contexts | Unit 3 provides centres with six different historical topics relating to world history. The optional topics provide opportunities to enhance learners' understanding of the world and the diverse experiences of its peoples. Options allow for the study of marginalised regions of the world, the histories of dispossessed peoples and forgotten empires, especially of the global South. |  |  |
|  | Option 3.1 Medieval: The Vikings, c.750 – c.1066 allows centres and learners to explore medieval history within Northern Europe and the Atlantic. Viking raids within Britain involve locations from Lindisfarne to Sheppey in eastern England, as well as the Orkney and Shetland islands in Scotland and across the Irish Sea in Ireland. However, these national connections are then linked into Scandinavia as well as raids in Europe on France and Spain, trading through what is now modern Russia and Ukraine, the Byzantine Empire and the Muslim trading networks centred around Baghdad. |  |  |
| Sustainability | Learners will understand that the lifestyle of the Vikings was shaped by the environment of Scandinavia, but also that climate change influenced their exploration as the medieval warm period reduced the sea ice in the northern Atlantic and kept the rivers of eastern Europe navigable through the winter. |  |  |
| Relationships and Sexuality Education | This unit considers the perspective of the Vikings, but also those from a diverse range of other societies they interacted with. |  |  |
|  | There are a wide range of perspectives on the Vikings and judgements about them from Europeans such as the English and the Irish, but also the Muslim societies and the Byzantine Empire in the Near East. The unit challenges the stereotype of the Vikings as violent barbarians. |  |  |

{37}------------------------------------------------

| Human Rights Education and Diversity | Learners will understand that slavery existed within Viking society, but also that the Vikings had positive relationship with a wide range of different peoples from the Irish in the west to the Arabs in the east.

#### **Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy**

There are many opportunities to include numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

#### **Examples**

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learning that statistics represent data, and that probability models chance, help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

# **Examples**

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

{41}------------------------------------------------
