## Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE History consists of four units. The combination of options selected for Units 1, 2 and 3 must include one medieval, one early modern and one modern unit.

The qualification is unitised and does not contain tiering. There is no hierarchy to the order the units should be taught.

| Who immigrated to and emigrated from Wales and the impact of their migration on Welsh society.   | Review the materials on Migration to the South Wales coalfield and organise the material on the numbers of immigrants and emigrants into a table. Outcome: Learners can demonstrate an understanding of Welsh society at the beginning of the 20th century. Advanced activity: Using the additional materials, organise a debate on the merits of social change in Wales. Learners can debate which was more significant (and why) - either the impact of Women's suffrage or migration (both inwards and outwards). They may also/alternatively debate whether the impact of change was likely to be positive or negative overall. Advanced outcome: Learners can begin to argue the significance or otherwise of changes in Welsh society at the start of the 20th century, analysing the causes of these changes and evaluating their relative significance.   | "Here comes the Devil": Welsh Suffrage and the Suffragettes Women in Welsh History - Cadw Working Abroad - Welsh Emigration   |

## Cross-curricular Skills - Numeracy

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learning that statistics represent data, and that probability models chance, help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

## Examples

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

## Examples

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

Examples • Learners will demonstrate creativity when developing responses, expressing their opinions about relevant historical issues and critically evaluating sources and evidence within assessments. • Learners have opportunities to be creative and innovative when presenting information and findings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Critical Thinking and Problem Solving | There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE History. These opportunities are important to learners because they develop the ability to think analytically, and to collect, reflect and critically evaluate evidence in order to make informed judgements on a range of topics. This skill can be applied to real-life scenarios. Examples • Learners will have opportunities to ask meaningful questions of source material and historical interpretations, as well as to evaluate them as part of their process of developing relevant critical arguments. • Learners will develop their ability to see issues from multiple viewpoints. • Studying continuity and change over time allows learners to develop their problem-solving skills that can be applied in their future lives. • Learners will evaluate sources and historical interpretations in terms of reliability, bias and purpose. • Critical thinking and problem solving encourages independent learning and promotes the ability to come to reasoned and informed decisions in other aspects of life such as further education or work. |
| Planning and Organisation             | There are many opportunities to include Planning and Organisation in GCSE History. These opportunities are important to Learners because these integral skills allow Learners to engage with the past, analyse information and communicate their findings which allow Learners to enhance their academic understanding and prepare them to apply historical knowledge in modern contexts.
