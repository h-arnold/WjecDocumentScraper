# Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE History consists of four units. The combination of options selected for Units 1, 2 and 3 must include one medieval, one early modern and one modern unit.

In Unit 4, centres can choose to repeat a time period previously studied in Units 1, 2 or 3. **However, the topics chosen for study in Unit 4 must not replicate or overlap with the content of any of the other selected units.**

The qualification is unitised and does not contain tiering. There is no hierarchy to the order the units should be taught.

Who immigrated to and emigrated from Wales and the impact of their migration on Welsh society.

Review the materials on *Migration to the South Wales coalfield* and organise the material on the numbers of immigrants and emigrants into a table.

#### Outcome:

Learners can demonstrate an understanding of Welsh society at the beginning of the 20th century.

#### Advanced activity:

Using the additional materials, organise a debate on the merits of social change in Wales. Learners can debate which was more significant (and why) – either the impact of Women's suffrage or migration (both inwards and outwards). They may also/alternatively debate whether the impact of change was likely to be positive or negative overall.

#### Advanced outcome:

Learners can begin to argue the significance or otherwise of changes in Welsh society at the start of the 20th century, analysing the causes of these changes and evaluating their relative significance.

The impact of radio, sport and cinema on the lives of Welsh people during the Depression and the 1930s.

Watch the clip from the *Poverty in the 1930s* video and explain why it can be argued that there were "two Britains" in the 1930s.

As a class work through the early stages of the BBC Timeline up to 1937. Discuss the impact the BBC had on Britain in the 1920s and 1930s.

Research activity in groups. Complete one of the following:

**Sport** (use the relevant resources, right, as a starting point):

- What is the difference between amateur and professional sport?
- Before the Second World War, which sports had become professionalised?
- Why did Rugby split into Rugby League and Rugby Union?
- How did the BBC contribute to the development of sport in the 1920s and 1930s.

**Cinema** (use the relevant resources, right, as a starting point):

- When and where did the first British and first Welsh cinema open?

#### Outcome:

Learners can demonstrate an understanding of the variety of roles completed by women in the Second World War and the impact of their roles on those women and on wider society.

#### Advanced activity:

Written task: Examine the impact of the Second World War on the women of Wales.

**Advanced outcome:** Learners are developing their analysis and evaluation skills via a short piece of continuous text.

{29}------------------------------------------------

2.5 hours

- the impact of aerial warfare on Wales, including:
  - the experience of evacuees and host families in Wales
  - the bombing of Cardiff, Swansea and Pembroke Dock.

Understand the experiences of people living in the areas in Wales that were subjected to bombing during the Second World War.

Understand the experiences of evacuees in Wales, including:

- positive and negative experiences
- issues of Welsh language
- impact on host families.

Understand the impact of the bombings on Cardiff, Swansea and Pembroke Dock.

#### Activities:

Watch the *BBC Lives of Evacuees* clip and make notes **and then** the BBC KS2 *The Blitz* video and make additional notes. Discuss: looking across these resources, how valuable are the two together in gaining an understanding of how different children felt about their experiences as evacuees and during the Blitz.

Using the resources and images, on a blank map of south and west Wales, identify the locations of Cardiff, Pembroke Dock and Swansea. Use this as the basis for a diagram that describes the bombing of these three areas (including outlying areas where appropriate, for example Neath and Port Talbot).

# Outcome:

Learners can demonstrate an understanding of/empathy with the experiences of evacuees, their hosts and of the people who experienced the aerial bombardments in Wales.

#### Advanced activity:

Creative writing: write a journal from the viewpoint of an evacuee who had moved from England to an area near to one of the Welsh places affected by bombing raids.

- the experience of immigrants to Wales including:
  - the Welsh Windrush generation and postwar rebuilding
  - the multi-racial community of Tiger Bay.

The experiences of the Welsh Windrush generation in Wales.

The importance of Tiger Bay as a multi-racial community.

#### Activity:

Look at the brief article on TigerBay.org and the pictures of Tiger Bay in Cardiff. What impressions do you have of the area? Why has it been, historically, such a multicultural hub?

Watch the BBC clip and briefly examine the relationship between the city of Cardiff and Tiger Bay. Discuss your findings in small groups.

Watch the BBC Newsround video and answer the following questions:

- Why did Britain need to be rebuilt in the late 1940s?
- Why did people from the Caribbean wish to come to the United Kingdom?
- What was the (full) name of the ship that brought people to Britain?
- When did they arrive?
- What were these immigrants' early experiences like?

Discussion: why didn't many parts of British society welcome the immigrants who had been invited to the United Kingdom to help rebuild it after the war?

- the influence of changes in leisure opportunities on the lives of people in Wales, including:
  - the impact of television
  - the growth of tourism.

Understand the increasing impact of television on society and culture in Wales.

Understand the growth of some areas in Wales as tourism hotspots.

# Activity:

As a class, review the *BBC Timeline* from the 1948 Olympics to the opening of BBC Television Centre in 1960. Individuals make notes and then choose four sections from the timeline and explain why they think these were particularly significant.

Watch *A Brief History – British Television* (6:45 to 8:51) and discuss how ITV was different to the BBC. Do you know what company broadcast ITV in Wales? In groups, read *About BBC Cymru Wales* and discuss the positives and negatives of broadcasting in Wales up to 1960.

In groups, summarise what you can remember of leisure during the 1930s and then look at the *This is Wales* document. Focus on your local area and discuss what tourist opportunities are available. Using the map at the end, pinpoint at least five tourist destinations in Wales that you have visited (and enjoyed) or read/heard about (and would like to visit). What is it about these places that you enjoyed/appeals to you?

Research activity. As a class develop a diagram of the changes in tourism from the end of the Second World War to 1960 (previous WJEC materials are available to support this in addition to the resources listed, right). Think about the following:

- Why were people keen for holidays in the late 1940s?
- How important was the development of caravan holidays?
- Why were holiday camps such as Butlins and Pontins so popular?
- How significant were cars and improved road connections?
- The impact of the National Parks, including Snowdonia/Eryri (1951), Pembrokeshire Coast (1952), Brecon Beacons/Bannau Brycheiniog (1957).

#### Outcome:

Leaners can demonstrate an understanding of the development of television in the 1950s, the ways in which tourism evolved after the Second World War, and the impact of these changes on the people of Wales.

#### Advanced activity:

Discuss: Was the 1950s a golden age of television and tourism in Britain?

### Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

#### Examples

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learning that statistics represent data, and that probability models chance, help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

# Examples

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

# Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competence

There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE History. Learners can make use of digital technology to access a broad range of historical sources and to undertake research of a historical topic. Learners will also have the opportunity to develop their digital skills in preparing and completing their non-examination assessments. These opportunities will allow learners to develop crosscurricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as allowing further access to historical information while fostering current and future critical thinking and ethical awareness.

Below are some examples of how Digital Competence can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

| Citizenship                              | Learners will develop an understanding of the importance of attributions, including the use of resources in digital<br>formats such as e-books and online articles. Learners will be required to address attributions when analysing<br>items for their historical enquiry and to think critically about the authors of digital evidence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |  |
