Learning Experiences

Learners should be encouraged to consider the following learning experiences and skills to
further develop their understanding, appreciation and awareness of the subject content.
Information in the table below provides opportunities for teachers to integrate the learning
experiences into delivery.

Learning Experience

Exemplification of Learning Experience

participate in educational
visits in person or digitally

Learners could visit many of the castles covered by this
specification, either virtually or in person. These include
Dinefwr, Kidwelly and Cardigan. There are YouTube links
for castle tours within the scheme of learning that can
support this learning experience.

develop empathy, tolerance,
compassion and curiosity
through studying different
historical contexts

Learners will understand why Christianity was important
to Lord Rhys, but also that there were different views
about the relationship between political and religious
leaders, as well as disputes over who made important
religious decisions for the Welsh kingdoms.

Unit 1.1 provides a range of opportunities for leaners to
work in groups. For example:
•

to summarise the information about the royal family of
Deheubarth in order to present an explanation to the
class for how Rhys ap Gruffudd established himself
as the ruler of Deheubarth
to discuss how powerful Lord Rhys was by the 1170s,
with one side arguing that he was and the other
arguing he was not.

•

There are also opportunities to debate, such as:
•  defending the idea that it was difficult for Rhys ap

Gruffudd to become ruler of Deheubarth or arguing
that it was simple and straightforward

•  how powerful Lord Rhys was by the time of his final

campaign in 1196 compared to other key points in his
life such as 1155 and 1172

•  whether it was the divisions amongst the sons of Lord
Rhys or the rising power of Gwynedd under the rule
of Llywelyn the Great that led to the downfall of
Deheubarth.

There are also many chances for discussion, including:
•  how significant submission to English authority was at
the royal council compared to the successes such as
Crogen

•  how important the distractions for Henry were, such
as the argument with the Church and problems with
his empire in France, in bringing about victory for the
Welsh princes

Cross-cutting Themes

Local, National &
International Contexts

Relationships and Sexuality
Education

Human Rights Education and
Diversity

Unit 1 provides centres with six different historical topics relating to the history of a range of areas within
Wales, allowing local or national contexts to be explored with learners.

Option 1.1 Medieval: Rhys ap Gruffudd, Prince of Deheubarth c.1132–c.1197 allows centres and learners to
explore Medieval history within South Wales. Several castles in west and south-west Wales such as
Kidwelly, Dinefwr and Cardigan play an important role in the restoration of the kingdom of Deheubarth after
its conquest by the Normans. As well as this there are important battles such as Crug Mawr and Ewloe
castle in the revolts against the Normans. Events in England, including the Anarchy, the Becket controversy,
the Great Revolt are also covered as well as the international Third Crusade.

In this unit, learners will explore the difficult relationships between the Norman marcher lords and the
native Welsh rulers and the impact this had on the people of Wales. There was also conflict between
the Welsh rulers leading to some areas such as Ceredigion changing hands frequently throughout this
period.

Learners will also be able to understand how, in the Marches and other border areas between Welsh
and Norman control, the indigenous Welsh and Norman settlers learned to live with others peacefully
for much of the time.

Large areas of Wales were colonised by the Normans as a result of their conquest. This was seen most
clearly in the areas controlled by the marcher lords who were given direct control over these territories by the
Norman kings of England.

The Norman Conquest is an example of imperialism from this period in history, and the establishment of the
Marches are an example of colonialism.

Careers and Work-Related
Experiences

There were lots of job opportunities for Welsh people in the Christian church in Wales in the medieval
period, such as a monk or nun. These jobs have largely disappeared now and are not usually an
aspiration for people living in modern Wales.

Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in
primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These
opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidence-
based conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History:

Learning about geometry
helps us understand
shape, space and position
and learning about
measurement helps us
quantify in the real world

Learning that statistics
represent data, and that
probability models
chance, help us make
informed inferences and
decisions

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps to understand the growth and development of empires or the
geographical representation of wars.

Examples

•  Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
•  Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
•  There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

Examples

•  Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land

expansion.

•  Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
•  There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

 GCSE History Unit 1 Option 1.1 Guidance for Teaching 31

Cross-curricular Skills - Digital Competence

There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE History.  Learners can make use of digital technology to access a
broad range of historical sources and to undertake research of a historical topic. Learners will also have the opportunity to develop their
digital skills in preparing and completing their non-examination assessments. These opportunities will allow learners to develop cross-
curricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as allowing further access to historical information while fostering
current and future critical thinking and ethical awareness.

Below are some examples of how digital competence can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learners will develop an understanding of the importance of attributions, including the use of resources in digital
formats such as e-books and online articles. Learners will be required to address attributions when analysing
items for their historical enquiry and to think critically about the authors of digital evidence.

Citizenship

Example

Interacting and
Collaborating

•  Learners should be made aware of copyright and plagiarism when looking at historical evidence and when

developing and presenting their own arguments in relation to a topic.

Learners can work collaboratively (digitally) on tasks in preparation for the exam. These could include peer
assessment, responding to teacher feedback or work creation.

Example

•

In groups, learners could research and present a topic to introduce an area of study.

Learners have opportunities to research a variety of sources digitally.

Producing

Example

•  Use of national and international archives to find source materials that link to the area of study.

opportunities are important to learners because they develop the ability to think analytically, and to collect,
reflect and critically evaluate evidence in order to make informed judgements on a range of topics. This skill can
be applied to real-life scenarios.

Examples

Critical Thinking and
Problem Solving

•  Learners will have opportunities to ask meaningful questions on source material and historical

interpretations, as well as to evaluate them as part of their process of developing relevant critical
arguments.

•  Learners will develop their ability to see issues from multiple viewpoints.
•  Studying continuity and change over time allows learners to develop their problem-solving skills that can be

applied in their future lives.

•  Learners will evaluate sources and historical interpretations in terms of reliability, bias and purpose.
•  Critical thinking and problem solving encourages independent learning and promotes the ability to come to

reasoned and informed decisions in other aspects of life such as further education or work.
