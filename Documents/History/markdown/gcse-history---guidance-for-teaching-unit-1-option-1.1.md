- the events and impact of war on Norman neighbours, including:
  - the attacks on Pembroke, Haverfordwest and Gower in 1189
  - the capturing of the castles of St Clears, Laugharne, Llansteffan and Nevern

The reasons why Lord Rhys ended up back at war with his Norman neighbours.

His successes in increasing his control over the castles of Southwest Wales.

## Activities:

Use a blank map of Wales to plot the locations of the castles captured in this campaign, adding a few details about what happened at each one.

Compare this to previous campaigns covered in this topic and identify the similarities and differences.

#### Outcome:

Learners can demonstrate that they understand why Lord Rhys began fighting his Norman neighbours again.

#### Advanced activity:

Use the comparison with previous campaigns to discuss how successful Lord Rhys was in this campaign compared to what he had achieved before.

## Advanced outcome:

Learners can draw conclusions about the extent to which Lord Rhys was successful in the wars with his Norman neighbours.

- Rhys's successful final campaign, including:
  - capturing the castles at Carmarthen, Colwyn and Radnor
  - defeating the army of Roger de Mortimer and Hugh de Say at Radnor.

The progress of the final campaign of Lord Rhys.

The importance of increasing the power of Deheubarth over more castles in South Wales.

The significance of his defeat of his Norman rivals in South Wales.

## Activities:

Continue to plot the locations of these victories on the map from the previous lesson.

Research the Norman lords that Lord Rhys was fighting to find out how powerful and important they were.

Discuss what this tells us about how powerful Lord Rhys was by the time he finished campaigning.

#### Outcome:

Learners can demonstrate that they understand Lord Rhys continued to be successful as a military leader up to his final campaign in 1196.

#### Advanced activity:

Debate how powerful Lord Rhys was by the time of his final campaign in 1196 compared to other key points in his life, such as 1155 and 1172.

#### Advanced outcome:

Learners can draw conclusions about how powerful Lord Rhys was by 1196.

| Local, National &<br>International Contexts | Unit 1 provides centres with six different historical topics relating to the history of a range of areas within Wales, allowing local or national contexts to be explored with learners.<br>Option 1.1 Medieval: Rhys ap Gruffudd, Prince of Deheubarth c.1132–c.1197 allows centres and learners to explore Medieval history within South Wales. Several castles in west and south-west Wales such as Kidwelly, Dinefwr and Cardigan play an important role in the restoration of the kingdom of Deheubarth after its conquest by the Normans. As well as this there are important battles such as Crug Mawr and Ewloe castle in the revolts against the Normans. Events in England, including the Anarchy, the Becket controversy, the Great Revolt are also covered as well as the international Third Crusade. |  |
| Relationships and Sexuality<br>Education    | In this unit, learners will explore the difficult relationships between the Norman marcher lords and the native Welsh rulers and the impact this had on the people of Wales. There was also conflict between the Welsh rulers leading to some areas such as Ceredigion changing hands frequently throughout this period.<br>Learners will also be able to understand how, in the Marches and other border areas between Welsh and Norman control, the indigenous Welsh and Norman settlers learned to live with others peacefully for much of the time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |  |
| Human Rights Education and<br>Diversity     | Large areas of Wales were colonised by the Normans as a result of their conquest. This was seen most clearly in the areas controlled by the marcher lords who were given direct control over these territories by the Norman kings of England.<br>The Norman Conquest is an example of imperialism from this period in history, and the establishment of the Marches are an example of colonialism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |  |
| Careers and Work-Related<br>Experiences     | There were lots of job opportunities for Welsh people in the Christian church in Wales in the medieval period, such as a monk or nun. These jobs have largely disappeared now and are not usually an aspiration for people living in modern Wales.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |  |

# Cross-curricular Skills - Literacy

There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE History. These opportunities include the analysis of source material, extended writing opportunities, vocabulary development, debating and discussion. These opportunities are important to learners because they will develop cross-curricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the Curriculum for Wales, as well as communication skills which can be used across subjects and prepare them for future education or employment.

Below are some examples of how literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History:

{33}------------------------------------------------

| Speaking | Learners will have the opportunity to develop their understanding of viewpoints and content through debate, discussion, presentations and group work.                                                                                         |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|          | ExamplesDebating the most important reason why an event happened.Asking questions for clarification and development of understanding.Learners can develop speaking skills through group and pair work.                                        |
| Writing  | Learners will have the opportunity to use a range of subject-specific vocabulary, idiomatic language and be able to present their work digitally. They will also have opportunities to reflect on the structure and content of their writing. |
|          | ExamplesRole modelling of answers through teacher, peer and self-assessment activities.Learners have the opportunity to use a wide range of writing styles such as formal, informal and first person.                                         |

{34}------------------------------------------------

# Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History:

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

#### Examples

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learning that statistics represent data, and that probability models chance, help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

#### Examples

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

{35}------------------------------------------------

# Cross-curricular Skills - Digital Competence

There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE History. Learners can make use of digital technology to access a broad range of historical sources and to undertake research of a historical topic. Learners will also have the opportunity to develop their digital skills in preparing and completing their non-examination assessments. These opportunities will allow learners to develop crosscurricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as allowing further access to historical information while fostering current and future critical thinking and ethical awareness.

Below are some examples of how digital competence can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

| Citizenship                      | Learners will develop an understanding of the importance of attributions, including the use of resources in digital<br>formats such as e-books and online articles. Learners will be required to address attributions when analysing<br>items for their historical enquiry and to think critically about the authors of digital evidence.<br><b>Example</b><br>• Learners should be made aware of copyright and plagiarism when looking at historical evidence and when<br>developing and presenting their own arguments in relation to a topic. |

| Interacting and<br>Collaborating | Learners can work collaboratively (digitally) on tasks in preparation for the exam. These could include peer<br>assessment, responding to teacher feedback or work creation.<br><b>Example</b><br>• In groups, learners could research and present a topic to introduce an area of study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Producing                        | Learners have opportunities<br>to research a variety of sources digitally.<br><b>Example</b><br>• Use of national and international archives to find source materials that link to the area of study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
