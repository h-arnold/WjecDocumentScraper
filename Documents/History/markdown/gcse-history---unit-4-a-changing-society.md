### <span id="page-3-0"></span>About this pack: information for teachers

This pack contains the assessment materials for Unit 4: A changing society

Within this pack, you will find:

- information for teachers on how to manage arrangements for assessment
- a mark record sheet
- a **candidate pack** which includes:
  - details of the assignment
  - a detailed breakdown of each task
  - information for candidates, which tells candidates about things that they must and must not do when they are completing the assessment
  - the mark scheme which must be used to assess candidate work
  - a Candidate Declaration Form
  - a Candidate Time Record sheet.

**You must provide each candidate with a copy of the complete candidate assessment pack.**

### Assessment Preparation

During the course, learners will engage with four items per theme in the classroom (two historical sources and two interpretations). From these items (36 in total), 15 will be selected by the centre for learners to choose from when completing the NEA. These will include four items for each of the two set themes, and one item for each of the other seven themes.

For example, if **Culture** and **Politics** are selected as the set themes one year, the fifteen items selected for assessment would be as follows:

| Culture                                                    | Equality and inequality                                         | Ethnicity                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|

### <span id="page-4-0"></span>Managing the assessment

This is a centre-marked (internal) non-examination assessment. The following arrangements must be followed when managing and marking the assessment

#### **Time**

Candidates must be allowed **4 hours 15 minutes** to complete this assessment. The assessment is a five-stage historical enquiry, which could be completed in one sitting, or in multiple, shorter sessions. Candidates should spend approximately:

- 40 minutes completing stage 1
- 90 minutes completing stage 2
- 20 minutes completing stage 3
- 85 minutes completing stage 4
- 20 minutes completing stage 5

The time suggested for each task takes account of the contribution of the task to the overall assessment requirements. There can be no changes to the total time available for this assessment. Centres can, however, amend the suggested time available for each task.

#### **Resources**

Candidates must have access to the candidate assessment pack and any necessary resources, as specified in the detailed task tables within the candidate pack.

| Permitted | Candidates have access to resources and/or preparatory notes as directed<br>by the brief or unit guidance.              |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|           | Candidates' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be<br>stored securely between timetabled sessions. |
|           | Centres should refer to specifications or subject-specific guidance.                                                    |

Where the level of control is permitted, resources are limited as follows:

| Task:      | Resources permitted:                                                                                                          |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stages 1-4 | When undertaking the historical enquiry, learners must be provided with clean copies of the items within the assessment pack. |
| Stages 1-4 | Classwork/notes for the unit.                                                                                                 |
| Stages 1-4 | Once the assessment has started centres must keep all classwork/notes securely stored in the centre.                          |
| Stages 1-4 | Learners are not permitted to bring new or additional classwork/notes into the assessment once it has started.                |

{6}------------------------------------------------

#### **Collaboration**

Group work is **not** allowed. Candidates must complete all tasks individually.

#### **Supervision**

Candidates must be supervised by an assessor whilst completing the activities. Centres must have in place systems to ensure candidates cannot access evidence they have been developing outside of supervised activities.

| Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

#### **Authentication**

Supervision must be in place to ensure the authenticity of evidence produced for summative assessment.

You should not provide input or guidance to candidates during the assessment time. This includes providing formative feedback on the evidence being produced. You can provide guidance on the requirements of the task and remind candidates of the mark bands and how they can be interpreted.

Candidates can review and redraft evidence independently within the time controls for the assessment.

Candidates must sign the declaration to confirm that all evidence submitted for moderation is their own work and that any sources used have been acknowledged.

Assessors must sign the declaration to confirm that evidence submitted for moderation was completed under the controlled conditions set out in this assessment.

Centres must provide an example assessment pack with the fifteen items made available to learners for the historical enquiry (one per centre).

{7}------------------------------------------------

#### **Candidate evidence**

The acceptable formats for evidence of each of the tasks is summarised in the task tables. Any modified assessment must enable the candidate to generate the evidence required in this table.

#### **Marking the assessment**

The marking scheme for this assessment are included in the candidate pack.

All marking of evidence must be made against the marking scheme provided. Evidence marked must comply with any requirements set out in the assessment pack.

Written evidence must be annotated to show how it relates to the mark band requirements.

Marking should only be undertaken by a designated assessor. An assessor should have appropriate expertise in the subject and level for a specified unit. The assessor is responsible for ensuring that:

- assessment is conducted under the controls specified in the task table
- they are clear about the requirements of the assessment and marking scheme prior to commencing assessment
- evidence presented for assessment is valid, authentic; reliable and credible
- assessment decisions are accurately recorded
- evidence is appropriately annotated
- judgements are only made against the mark band statements

A mark record sheet must be completed for each candidate.

#### **Further information**

You should refer the JCQ Instructions for conducting non-examination assessment for further information on managing assessment within our GCSE qualifications.

## The items

*Example pack by WJEC – for the live assessment this pack will be created by the centre.*

### **Item A International relations**

Adapted from a blog entry entitled "The death of Edward the Confessor and the conflicting claims to the English Crown" on the website of the British Government (2016).

Edward was the eldest son of King Æthelred ('the Unready') from his second marriage to Emma, the sister of Duke Richard II of Normandy. This marriage had been arranged as part of Æthelred's attempts to improve English relations with Normandy. But Æthelred had sons from his first marriage to Æflgifyu of York, and when he died in 1016, there was a struggle for the throne between his eldest surviving son, Edmund Ironside, and Cnut the Great of Denmark. However, within months, Edmund too died, and Cnut succeeded to the kingdom of England.

At Cnut's death, another succession dispute broke out between the sons of Cnut's first wife, Æflgifyu of Northampton, and those of his second wife, Æthelred's widow, Emma. In that dispute, Edward's brother, Alfred, was murdered, perhaps at the instigation of Emma. Only after seven long years did Edward eventually succeed to the kingdom of England in 1042, putting the line of Wessex back on the English throne.

### **Item B Equality and Inequality**

A medieval illustration of serfs harvesting wheat with reaping-hooks or sickles under the supervision of a reeve [a senior official with local responsibilities] (c. 1310)

{18}------------------------------------------------

**Item C Peace and conflict**

An account of the resistance to Norman rule by the English Monk and Historian, Orderic Vitalis, in his chronicle *Historia Ecclesiastica* [History of the Church] (1141).

The fortifications called castles by the Normans were scarcely known in England and so the English – in spite of that courage and love of fighting – could put up only weak resistance to their enemies.

**Item D Culture**

A description of the building of square-keep castles in the textbook *The Medieval Realms* (1991)

Motte and bailey castles had weaknesses. They were built out of wood, which rotted easily and could be set on fire by enemy soldiers. They were also cramped, drafty and uncomfortable. Since the beginning of the conquest the Normans had built some important castles, like the White Tower in London, out of stone. After 1100, many more stone castles were built, and they were usually square in shape

**Item E Culture**

A twenty-first-century reconstructed view of the Tower of London, a Norman Castle surrounded by Roman Walls. This is how the Tower was believed to have looked c.1100

{19}------------------------------------------------

**Item F Culture**

A twenty-first-century photograph of Chepstow Castle on the cliffs above the River Wye in Monmouthsire. Building of the castle began in 1067. Chepstow was the most southern of the castles built across the marches as a Norman defence against attacks from the Welsh.

![](_page_18_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Item G Culture**

From "The Second Continuation" of the *Peterborough Chronicle* (1132–1154).

**1137** When King Stephen came to England, he held his council at Oxford. There he seized Bishop Roger of Salisbury, Bishop Alexander of Lincoln, and his nephew Roger the chancellor, and threw them all into prison until they gave up their castles. But when the nobles who supported Matilda understood that Stephen was a mild man – soft and good – who did not execute [inflict] harsh justice they became forgetful of their pledge to him. These nobles filled the land with castles and cruelly oppressed the wretched men of the land with castle building. When the castles were made, they filled them with devils and evil men. They took anyone who they thought had riches and threw them into prison for their gold and silver.

Never were any martyrs tortured as they were: some were hung by the feet and smoked with foul smoke, some were hung by their thumbs, others by their head, with coats of mail hung on their feet. They tied knotted strings about their heads and twisted them till they went to their brains. They threw them into dungeons that had snakes and toads and killed them that way. Some they placed in a chest that was short, narrow and shallow, and put sharp stones in and crushed the man inside and broke all his limbs. In many of the castles were heavy shackles – fetters and nooses – that were so heavy two or three men could barely carry one. They were fastened to a beam; and a sharp iron was placed around the man's throat and neck, so that he could turn in no direction. He could not sit, not lie, not sleep, just bear all that weight. Many thousands they killed with hunger.

I cannot tell all the horrors and all the pains inflicted on the wretched men in this land, and this lasted for nineteen winters while Stephen was king, and ever it grew worse and worse. 

{20}------------------------------------------------

**Item H Ethnicity**

Adapted from an article entitled "England's Jewish Population" introducing visitors to Clifford's Tower, York on the English Heritage website (early twenty-first century)

After the Norman Conquest of 1066, a number of Jews came to England from Rouen in France. The early Norman kings needed to borrow money to build castles and secure their kingdom, but money-lending was forbidden to Christians. It was, however, permitted to Jews. These French-speaking Jews were protected by the Crown, and in time established communities in most of the principal cities of England. In the later twelfth century, members of the Jewish community in Lincoln settled in York.

However, there was growing hostility towards the Jewish population in England. This was in part due to public disagreements in theology between Jewish scholars and Christian churchmen. In the mid-twelfth century several vicious stories were spread accusing Jews of murdering Christian children. Such slanders, now known as the 'Blood Libel', strengthened anti-Semitic sentiment in England.

**Item I Ethnicity**

Extracts from the *Great Roll of the Pipe* [the financial records of the Exchequer or Treasury] *for the fifth year of the reign of King Henry II, 1158–1159*. The amounts contributed by each Jewish community to the tax (donum) levied in c. 1159 shows the location of these settlements. Please note that:

Shilling = 12 pence

Mark = 13 shillings and 4 pence (160 pence)

Pound = 20 shillings (240 pence)

Northamptonshire The same sheriff renders a calculation of 15 pounds of the

Jews of Northamptonshire.

London and Middlesex The same sheriff makes a calculation of 200 marks per Jew.

Worcestershire The same sheriff makes a calculation of 2 marks per Jew.

Oxfordshire The same sheriff makes a calculation of 20 marks per Jew

Gloucestershire The same sheriff makes a calculation of 5 marks of the Jews.

Lincolnshire The same sheriff makes a calculation of 40 pounds per Jew.

Norwich The same sheriff makes a sum of 43 pounds and 6 shillings

and 8 pence of Norwich Jews.

{21}------------------------------------------------

**Item J Ethnicity**

Adapted from an account of the alleged killing by Jews of William of Norwich, a twelveyear-old apprentice in Norwich in 1144. The account was written by the monk, Thomas of Monmouth, in his biography *The Life and Miracles of St William of Norwich*, sometime between 1149 and 1172.

On the day of the Passover, after the singing of the hymns in the synagogue, the chiefs of the Jews assembled in the House of the Jew where the boy William was. Suddenly, they seized hold of the boy as he was having his dinner and treated him in various horrible ways. For a while some of them held him behind, others opened his mouth and introduced an instrument of torture which is called a teazle, and, fixing it by straps through both jaws to the back of his neck, they fastened it with a knot as tightly as it could be drawn. After that, taking a short piece of rope of about the thickness of one's little finger and tying three knots in it at certain distances marked out, they bound the rope round that innocent head, forcing the middle knot into his forehead and the two others into his temples. They stretched the two ends of the rope at the back of his head and fastened in a very tight knot. The ends of the rope were then passed round his neck and carried round his throat and his chin, and there they finished off this dreadful engine of torture in a fifth knot …

Having shaved his head, they stabbed it with countless thorn points, and made the blood come horribly from the wounds they made … Some of those present adjudged him to be fixed to a cross in mockery of the Lord's passion, as though they would say "Even as we condemned the Christ to a shameful death so let us condemn the Christian".

{22}------------------------------------------------

**Item K Ethnicity**

A late-medieval woodcut entitled "Guilhelmus puer crucifixus" [the boy William is crucified] from the workshop of the German artist Michel Wolgemut, in the Nuremberg Chronicle (c.1493). It depicts the alleged crucifixion of William of Norwich by Jews.

### **Item M Society and economy**

A *BBC Bitesize* video explaining why William needed Domesday Book (early twenty-first century)

How successful William's conquest of England had been was revealed in a survey, conducted in 1086.

With the constant threat of rebellion, he needed to know how much tax he could raise to fund an army. Norman commissioners held public inquests in towns and villages right across England. They questioned who held the land now, and who had owned it in 1066. They wanted to know everything, from how many freemen and slaves there were, to how many ploughs and pigs.

The English people called it the Domesday Book, the day of judgment. It revealed William possessed about 20% of the wealth of England, his barons 50%, and the Church had 25%. The surviving English nobles had a meagre 5%.

The Anglo-Saxons had been totally overpowered. William had conquered, and secured the power of England, and the Normans had completely taken over.

**Item N Politics**

Clause 1 of the Charter of Liberties of Henry I (1100)

1. Know that by the mercy of God and the common counsel of the barons of the whole kingdom of England I have been crowned king of said kingdom; and because the kingdom had been oppressed by unjust exactions [unfair taxes], I, through fear of God and the love which I have toward you all, in the first place make the Holy Church of God free, so that I will neither sell nor put to farm, nor on the death of archbishop or bishop or abbot will I take anything from the Church's demesne [estate] or from its men until the successor shall enter it. And I take away all the evil customs by which the kingdom of England was unjustly oppressed.

### **Item O Sex, sexuality and gender**

An extract from a book by the popular historian Phillipa Gregory on the role of women in History entitled *Normal Women: 900 years of making History* (2023)

[The Empress] Matilda was the first Norman woman to inherit the English throne, and forced be the first queen militant – raising her own army and leading it into battle for two years of skirmishes, until her victory at the Battle of Lincoln in 1141. She imprisoned the pretender Stephen and ignored a demand from his wife, Queen Matilda of Boulogne. Matilda of Boulogne then raised her own army to plunder the country around London, persuading Londoners to ally with her against the empress, who moved her forces to Winchester and besieged the bishop's castle. Matilda of Boulogne pursued Empress Matilda and defeated her. For six years Empress Matilda led her own troops, her own vassals and knights, and paid mercenaries to follow her into battle. Eventually Steven acknowledged his defeat and made peace, but even then he did not hand over the throne. He named Matilda's son as heir, and the boy became Henry II.

### Information for candidates

The following information has been taken from the [JCQ Information for candidates –](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) non[examination assessments](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) and the [JCQ Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) Use in Assessments:](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/)  [Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/) This tells you about things that you **must** and **must not** do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not understand, you **must** ask your teacher.

#### **Preparing your work**

- When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you need to ensure that your final product reflects your own independent work and isn't copied or paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
- If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you **must** tell your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
- If you worked as part of a group on a task, you **must** each write up your own account of the assignment. Even if the data you have is the same, you **must** describe in your own words how that data was obtained, and you **must** independently draw your own conclusions from the data.
- Take care of your work and keep it safe. **Do not** leave it lying around where your classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You **must** always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; **do not** share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
- **Do not** be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI tools and chatbots) – this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort of copying.
- You **must not** write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

#### **Plagiarism**

Plagiarism involves taking someone else's words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them off as your own. **It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously.** Don't think you won't be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:

- Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
- Markers are highly experienced subject specialists they may have read the source you are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!
- Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and style of writing or punctuation.

#### **Penalties for breaking the regulations**

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be applied:

- the piece of work will be awarded zero marks
- you will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question
- you will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series
- you will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

**Remember – it's your qualification so it needs to be your own work.**
