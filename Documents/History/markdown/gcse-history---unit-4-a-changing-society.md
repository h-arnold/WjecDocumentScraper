Managing the assessment

This is a centre-marked (internal) non-examination assessment. The following arrangements
must be followed when managing and marking the assessment

Time

Candidates must be allowed 4 hours 15 minutes to complete this assessment. The
assessment is a five-stage historical enquiry, which could be completed in one sitting, or in
multiple, shorter sessions. Candidates should spend approximately:

•  40 minutes completing stage 1
•  90 minutes completing stage 2
•  20 minutes completing stage 3
•  85 minutes completing stage 4
•  20 minutes completing stage 5

The time suggested for each task takes account of the contribution of the task to the overall
assessment requirements. There can be no changes to the total time available for this
assessment. Centres can, however, amend the suggested time available for each task.

Resources

Candidates must have access to the candidate assessment pack and any necessary
resources, as specified in the detailed task tables within the candidate pack.

Candidates have access to resources and/or preparatory notes as directed
by the brief or unit guidance.

Permitted

Candidates' work must remain within the centre at all times and must be
stored securely between timetabled sessions.

Centres should refer to specifications or subject-specific guidance.

Where the level of control is permitted, resources are limited as follows:

Collaboration

Group work is not allowed. Candidates must complete all tasks individually.

Supervision

Candidates must be supervised by an assessor whilst completing the activities. Centres
must have in place systems to ensure candidates cannot access evidence they have been
developing outside of supervised activities.

Type

Description

The use of resources is tightly prescribed.
The centre must ensure that:
•  all candidates are within direct sight of the supervisor throughout the

session(s)

•  display materials which might provide assistance are removed or

covered
there is no access to e-mail, the internet or mobile phones

•
•  candidates complete their work independently
•
•  no assistance of any description is provided.

interaction with other candidates does not occur

be stored securely between timetabled sessions.

Where direct supervision is specified, the centre must ensure that the JCQ
No Mobile Phone poster and JCQ Warning to Candidates is displayed.

Direct

Authentication

Supervision must be in place to ensure the authenticity of evidence produced for summative
assessment.
You should not provide input or guidance to candidates during the assessment time. This

guidance on the requirements of the task and remind candidates of the mark bands and how
they can be interpreted.

Candidates can review and redraft evidence independently within the time controls for the
assessment.

Candidates must sign the declaration to confirm that all evidence submitted for moderation is
their own work and that any sources used have been acknowledged.

Assessors must sign the declaration to confirm that evidence submitted for moderation was
completed under the controlled conditions set out in this assessment.

Centres must provide an example assessment pack with the fifteen items made available to
learners for the historical enquiry (one per centre).

The items
Example pack by WJEC – for the live assessment this pack will be created by the centre.

Item A

International relations

Adapted from a blog entry entitled “The death of Edward the Confessor and the conflicting
claims to the English Crown” on the website of the British Government (2016).

Edward was the eldest son of King Æthelred (‘the Unready’) from his second marriage to
Emma, the sister of Duke Richard II of Normandy. This marriage had been arranged as
part of Æthelred’s attempts to improve English relations with Normandy. But Æthelred had
sons from his first marriage to Æflgifyu of York, and when he died in 1016, there was a
struggle for the throne between his eldest surviving son, Edmund Ironside, and Cnut the
Great of Denmark. However, within months, Edmund too died, and Cnut succeeded to the
kingdom of England.

At Cnut’s death, another succession dispute broke out between the sons of Cnut’s first
wife, Æflgifyu of Northampton, and those of his second wife, Æthelred’s widow, Emma. In
that dispute, Edward’s brother, Alfred, was murdered, perhaps at the instigation of Emma.
Only after seven long years did Edward eventually succeed to the kingdom of England in
1042, putting the line of Wessex back on the English throne.

Item B

Equality and Inequality

A medieval illustration of serfs harvesting wheat with reaping-hooks or sickles under the
supervision of a reeve [a senior official with local responsibilities] (c. 1310)

Item C

Peace and conflict

An account of the resistance to Norman rule by the English Monk and Historian, Orderic
Vitalis, in his chronicle Historia Ecclesiastica [History of the Church] (1141).

The fortifications called castles by the Normans were scarcely known in England and so
the English – in spite of that courage and love of fighting – could put up only weak
resistance to their enemies.

Item D

Culture

A description of the building of square-keep castles in the textbook The Medieval Realms
(1991)

Motte and bailey castles had weaknesses. They were built out of wood, which rotted easily
and could be set on fire by enemy soldiers. They were also cramped, drafty and
uncomfortable. Since the beginning of the conquest the Normans had built some important
castles, like the White Tower in London, out of stone. After 1100, many more stone castles
were built, and they were usually square in shape

Item E

Culture

A twenty-first-century reconstructed view of the Tower of London, a Norman Castle
surrounded by Roman Walls. This is how the Tower was believed to have looked c.1100

9

Item F

Culture

A twenty-first-century photograph of Chepstow Castle on the cliffs above the River Wye in
Monmouthsire. Building of the castle began in 1067. Chepstow was the most southern of
the castles built across the marches as a Norman defence against attacks from the Welsh.

Item G

Culture

From “The Second Continuation” of the Peterborough Chronicle (1132–1154).

1137  When King Stephen came to England, he held his council at Oxford. There he
seized Bishop Roger of Salisbury, Bishop Alexander of Lincoln, and his nephew Roger the
chancellor, and threw them all into prison until they gave up their castles. But when the
nobles who supported Matilda understood that Stephen was a mild man – soft and good –
who did not execute [inflict] harsh justice they became forgetful of their pledge to him.
These nobles filled the land with castles and cruelly oppressed the wretched men of the
land with castle building. When the castles were made, they filled them with devils and evil
men. They took anyone who they thought had riches and threw them into prison for their
gold and silver.

Never were any martyrs tortured as they were: some were hung by the feet and smoked
with foul smoke, some were hung by their thumbs, others by their head, with coats of mail
hung on their feet. They tied knotted strings about their heads and twisted them till they
went to their brains. They threw them into dungeons that had snakes and toads and killed
them that way. Some they placed in a chest that was short, narrow and shallow, and put
sharp stones in and crushed the man inside and broke all his limbs. In many of the castles
were heavy shackles – fetters and nooses – that were so heavy two or three men could
barely carry one. They were fastened to a beam; and a sharp iron was placed around the
man's throat and neck, so that he could turn in no direction. He could not sit, not lie, not
sleep, just bear all that weight. Many thousands they killed with hunger.
I cannot tell all the horrors and all the pains inflicted on the wretched men in this land, and
this lasted for nineteen winters while Stephen was king, and ever it grew worse and worse.

Item H

Ethnicity

Adapted from an article entitled “England’s Jewish Population” introducing visitors to
Clifford’s Tower, York on the English Heritage website (early twenty-first century)

After the Norman Conquest of 1066, a number of Jews came to England from Rouen in
France. The early Norman kings needed to borrow money to build castles and secure their
kingdom, but money-lending was forbidden to Christians. It was, however, permitted to
Jews. These French-speaking Jews were protected by the Crown, and in time established
communities in most of the principal cities of England. In the later twelfth century, members
of the Jewish community in Lincoln settled in York.

However, there was growing hostility towards the Jewish population in England. This was
in part due to public disagreements in theology between Jewish scholars and Christian
churchmen. In the mid-twelfth century several vicious stories were spread accusing Jews
of murdering Christian children. Such slanders, now known as the ‘Blood Libel’,
strengthened anti-Semitic sentiment in England.

Item I

Ethnicity

Extracts from the Great Roll of the Pipe [the financial records of the Exchequer or
Treasury] for the fifth year of the reign of King Henry II, 1158–1159. The amounts
contributed by each Jewish community to the tax (donum) levied in c. 1159 shows the
location of these settlements. Please note that:
Shilling  = 12 pence

 The same sheriff makes a calculation of 20 marks per Jew

Gloucestershire

 The same sheriff makes a calculation of 5 marks of the Jews.

Norwich

 The same sheriff makes a sum of 43 pounds and 6 shillings
and 8 pence of Norwich Jews.

Item J

Ethnicity

Adapted from an account of the alleged killing by Jews of William of Norwich, a twelve-
year-old apprentice in Norwich in 1144. The account was written by the monk, Thomas of
Monmouth, in his biography The Life and Miracles of St William of Norwich, sometime
between 1149 and 1172.

On the day of the Passover, after the singing of the hymns in the synagogue, the chiefs of
the Jews assembled in the House of the Jew where the boy William was. Suddenly, they
seized hold of the boy as he was having his dinner and treated him in various horrible
ways. For a while some of them held him behind, others opened his mouth and introduced
an instrument of torture which is called a teazle, and, fixing it by straps through both jaws
to the back of his neck, they fastened it with a knot as tightly as it could be drawn. After
that, taking a short piece of rope of about the thickness of one's little finger and tying three
knots in it at certain distances marked out, they bound the rope round that innocent head,
forcing the middle knot into his forehead and the two others into his temples. They
stretched the two ends of the rope at the back of his head and fastened in a very tight knot.
The ends of the rope were then passed round his neck and carried round his throat and his
chin, and there they finished off this dreadful engine of torture in a fifth knot …

Having shaved his head, they stabbed it with countless thorn points, and made the blood
come horribly from the wounds they made … Some of those present adjudged him to be
fixed to a cross in mockery of the Lord's passion, as though they would say “Even as we
condemned the Christ to a shameful death so let us condemn the Christian”.

Ethnicity

A late-medieval woodcut entitled “Guilhelmus puer crucifixus” [the boy William is crucified]
from the workshop of the German artist Michel Wolgemut, in the Nuremberg Chronicle
(c.1493). It depicts the alleged crucifixion of William of Norwich by Jews.

Item M

Society and economy

A BBC Bitesize video explaining why William needed Domesday Book (early twenty-first
century)

How successful William’s conquest of England had been was revealed in a survey,
conducted in 1086.

With the constant threat of rebellion, he needed to know how much tax he could raise to
fund an army. Norman commissioners held public inquests in towns and villages right
across England. They questioned who held the land now, and who had owned it in 1066.
They wanted to know everything, from how many freemen and slaves there were, to how
many ploughs and pigs.

The English people called it the Domesday Book, the day of judgment. It revealed William
possessed about 20% of the wealth of England, his barons 50%, and the Church had 25%.
The surviving English nobles had a meagre 5%.

The Anglo-Saxons had been totally overpowered. William had conquered, and secured the
power of England, and the Normans had completely taken over.

Item N

Politics

Clause 1 of the Charter of Liberties of Henry I (1100)

1.

Know that by the mercy of God and the common counsel of the barons of the whole
kingdom of England I have been crowned king of said kingdom; and because the
kingdom had been oppressed by unjust exactions [unfair taxes], I, through fear of
God and the love which I have toward you all, in the first place make the Holy
Church of God free, so that I will neither sell nor put to farm, nor on the death of
archbishop or bishop or abbot will I take anything from the Church’s demesne
[estate] or from its men until the successor shall enter it. And I take away all the evil
customs by which the kingdom of England was unjustly oppressed.

Item O

Sex, sexuality and gender

An extract from a book by the popular historian Phillipa Gregory on the role of women in
History entitled Normal Women: 900 years of making History (2023)

[The Empress] Matilda was the first Norman woman to inherit the English throne, and
forced be the first queen militant – raising her own army and leading it into battle for two
years of skirmishes, until her victory at the Battle of Lincoln in 1141. She imprisoned the
pretender Stephen and ignored a demand from his wife, Queen Matilda of Boulogne.
Matilda of Boulogne then raised her own army to plunder the country around London,
persuading Londoners to ally with her against the empress, who moved her forces to
Winchester and besieged the bishop’s castle. Matilda of Boulogne pursued Empress
Matilda and defeated her. For six years Empress Matilda led her own troops, her own
vassals and knights, and paid mercenaries to follow her into battle. Eventually Steven
acknowledged his defeat and made peace, but even then he did not hand over the throne.
He named Matilda’s son as heir, and the boy became Henry II.

paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you must tell
your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
If you worked as part of a group on a task, you must each write up your own account of
the assignment. Even if the data you have is the same, you must describe in your own
words how that data was obtained, and you must independently draw your own
conclusions from the data.

•  Take care of your work and keep it safe. Do not leave it lying around where your

classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You
must always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; do not
share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your
password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
•  Do not be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI

tools and chatbots) – this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort
of copying.

•  You must not write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

Plagiarism

Plagiarism involves taking someone else’s words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them
off as your own. It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously. Don’t think you
won’t be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:
•  Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
•  Markers are highly experienced subject specialists – they may have read the source you

•

are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!
Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match
phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and
style of writing or punctuation.

Penalties for breaking the regulations

the piece of work will be awarded zero marks

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be
applied:
•
•  you will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question
•  you will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series
•  you will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of

time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

Remember – it’s your qualification so it needs to be your own work.
