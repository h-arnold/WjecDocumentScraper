Item 1

Thomas Jones Pierce, a medieval historian, writing in the
article “Rhys ap Gruffudd (1132–1197), Lord of
Deheubarth” in the Dictionary of Welsh Biography (1959)

His last years were dominated by the disobedience of his sons, and by Richard I’s lack of
interest in the special position which Rhys ap Gruffudd had held under Henry II. Believing
attack to be the best means of defence, Lord Rhys resumed attacks against his Norman
neighbours, which continued until the end of his life.

Item 2

David Ross, a historian, writing in his general-interest
history book Wales, History of a Nation (2005)

When Lord Rhys [ap Gruffudd] established his rule in Ceredigion he took over patronage
of the newly built abbey at Strata Florida. It was rebuilt, enlarged and given large amounts
of land. Welsh lords and princes would come here in their old age to prepare for death
and burial. Strata Florida became the most important abbey in Wales.

Item 3

An anonymous author, writing in the entry for 1176 in Brut
y Tywysogion a Welsh translation of a lost Latin text
Chronicle of the Princes of Wales. It is likely that the
translation was made by Welsh monks at the abbey of
Strata Florida.

And then Lord Rhys held a special feast at Cardigan and he set two kinds of contests.
One between the bards and poets, and another between the harpists, the pipers and
other players of stringed instruments. And he set two chairs for the winners of these
contests. He also made them rich with great gifts.

Item 1

An unknown author writing in the article “Final days of
Owain Glyndwr” on the website of the Owain Glyndwr
Society (updated in 2017)

By 1412 Glyndwr had lost control of most of the territory he had previously held. Some
areas were still defiant, but not enough to provide effective resistance. An exception to
this was Meirionnydd, where the English crown had difficulty in exerting its control, and
resistance continued until Glyndwr's death.

Item 2

An extract from the Penal Laws against the Welsh passed
by Henry IV’s Parliament in 1402.

It is ordered that no Englishman be convicted by any Welshman but by Englishmen.
It is ordered that no Welshman shall be armed upon pain of imprisonment.
It is ordered that no Welshman shall have his own castle, fortress nor defended house.

Item 3

Gideon Brough, a university lecturer in medieval History,
writing in his academic book The Rise and Fall of Owain
Glyndwr – England, France and the Welsh Rebellion in the
Late Middle Ages (2017)

The Battle of Bryn Glas in 1402 had a significant impact on support for the Welsh Revolt.
This showed that the Welsh were organised, well prepared, and well led, and that they
were following a plan that was working. The English lost a lot of men and their equipment
was used to strengthen the Welsh military. The revolt grew in strength and began to
overwhelm the English army and the English government in Wales.

MARK SCHEME

Guidance for examiners

Generic marking principles

•  Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).

•  Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar

when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark
scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.

•  Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for
the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the
quality of the candidate responses seen).

•  Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme.
Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

Positive marking

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit
should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of
penalising him/her for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to
achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be
deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points based, the mark scheme should be applied
precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates’ answers. The list is not
exhaustive. The inclusion of ‘Credit any other valid response.’ (or similar instruction) within
mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates’ responses. Credit should be
given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates’ answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However,
unless there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks
where the answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

Banded mark schemes

For band-marked questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the
assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in
candidates’ answers. It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate’s response. As
noted above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive, and candidates do not have
to include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the
requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it
contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been
provided, no marks should be awarded.

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each
candidate’s response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills,
knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors
or omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate’s answer to pick out the evidence
that is being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied. This is done
as a two-stage process.

Stage 1 – Deciding on the band

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate’s answer and check
whether it matches the descriptors for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are
satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band
until the descriptors match the answer.

If an answer covers different aspects of different bands within the mark scheme, a ‘best fit’
approach should be adopted to decide on the band and then the candidate’s response
should be used to decide on the mark within the band. For instance, if a response is mainly
in band 2 but with a limited amount of band 3 content, the answer would be placed in band
2, but the mark awarded would be close to the top of band 2 as a result of the band 3
content.

Examiners should not seek to mark candidates down as a result of small omissions in minor
areas of an answer.

Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark

During standardising (the marking conference), detailed advice from the Principal Examiner
on the qualities of each mark band will be given. Examiners will then receive examples of
answers in each mark band that have been awarded a mark by the Principal Examiner.
Examiners should mark the examples and compare their marks with those of the Principal
Examiner.

When marking, examiners can use these examples to decide whether a candidate’s
response is of a superior, inferior or comparable standard to the example. Examiners are
reminded of the need to revisit the answer as they apply the mark scheme in order to
confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the response provided.

Explain why there was conflict in South Wales between 1146 and 1170.

Indicative Content

Total Marks

[10]

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be
acceptable.

•  Conflict was largely the result of the ebb and flow of power in South Wales. The Normans had taken Deheubarth from Rhys ap Tewdwr in

1093 and his family had been fighting for its return since 1116. On the death of Gruffudd ap Rhys, his children – including Rhys ap Gruffudd –
had continued to fight for the return of this territory.

•  Norman lords were also unable to intervene in events in Wales. They lacked the support of a strong monarch in England as the throne of

England was contested until 1154. This meant that there was ongoing competition with Gwynedd for territory as Owain Gwynedd was also
taking advantage of those Norman weaknesses.

•  As power moved back to the English kings, with the accession of Henry II in 1154, there were renewed attacks on the territories of Welsh

rulers, including the invasion of Deheubarth. In 1163 Rhys ap Gruffudd made an alliance against the English with Owain Gwynedd as part of
a Welsh revolt against English invasions, which resulted in successful campaigns for the Welsh and peace with Henry II by 1170.

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is

•  Rhys ap Gruffudd attacked the Norman lordships in Pembroke, Haverfordwest and Gower in

1189. As part of this campaign, Rhys captured castles at St Clears, Laugharne and
Llansteffan. He ended the siege of Carmarthen in 1189 to go to a meeting with Richard I at
Oxford, although Richard never turned up for this meeting.
In 1190 Rhys ap Gruffudd added the Norman lordships of Cydweli and Carnwyllion to
Deheubarth. Rhys attacked the lands of his son-in-law William Fitzwilliam in 1191, even
though he had sworn an oath not to do this.
In 1196, as the English were focusing on the threat from Powys, Rhys seized the opportunity
to capture a number of Norman Marcher Lords’ castles, including Carmarthen, Colwyn,
Radnor and Painscastle.

Question 3b

How valuable is Item 1 to our understanding of the reasons why Rhys ap Gruffudd became involved in warfare between 1189 and
1196?

Item 1: Thomas Jones Pierce, a medieval historian, writing in  the article “Rhys ap Gruffudd (1132–1197), Lord of Deheubarth” in
the Dictionary of Welsh Biography (1959)

His last years were dominated by the disobedience of his sons, and by Richard I’s lack of interest in the special position which
Rhys ap Gruffudd had held under Henry II. Believing attack to be the best means of defence, Lord Rhys resumed attacks against
his Norman neighbours, which continued until the end of his life.

Indicative Content

Total
Marks

[15]

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be
acceptable.

•  The item is valuable to an understanding of why Rhys became involved in warfare at this time as it explains that, towards the end of his
life, he had problems with his sons. However, its value is limited as it is important to understand the reasons for these problems, for
example his sons, Maelgwn, Rhys Gryg and Maredudd were concerned about the question of succession.

•  The item also has value in that it states that the Norman lords seemed more of a threat now that Rhys no longer had the support of the

King of England. But this too is undermined by the lack of explanation as to why Richard I of England did not give him the same
privileges that Henry II had given him. This was nothing to do with Rhys, but a consequence of the difficult relationship between Richard
I and his father, Henry II.

•  The information this item – which is an interpretation – includes is accurate, and this would be expected in an article by a medieval

historian. This could be argued to enhance its value in understanding why Rhys became involved in warfare at this late stage; however,
it is also brief and undeveloped, but this again would be expected given the interpretation is from a short biographical entry aimed at
providing an overview of Rhys’s life.
It may also be suggested that the interpretation’s value is enhanced by it being written by a medieval historian, who may be expected to
have a better understanding of this historical context as well as a more in-depth knowledge of contemporary sources. On the other
hand, the views expressed may also be somewhat dated in a biography that is over half a century old.

•

•  Overall, it could be suggested that the item is valuable in that it provides an expert analysis of the reasons why Rhys ap Gruffudd

became involved in warfare between 1189 and 1196, or its brevity and relative outdatedness may be argued to be limiting factors that
make it less, rather than more valuable to our understanding of this issue.

Outline Rhys ap Gruffudd’s relations with Henry II between 1170 and 1189.

Indicative Content

Total
Marks

[5]

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material
is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

•  The relations between Rhys ap Gruffudd and Henry II were good. Rhys and Henry met in
Pembroke in October 1171, where the English King agreed to uphold Rhys’s territorial
gains in return for Rhys’s recognition of Henry’s overlordship.

•  Subsequently, Henry recognised Rhys as the most important ruler in Wales and

appointed him Justiciar in 1172. This meant that Rhys was able to rule in Henry’s
absence, and it was an important and unique achievement among Welsh rulers at this
time.

•  Rhys’s position was also elevated by his involvement in the Royal Council, which was the

meeting between the Crown and the most important nobles. He attended the Royal
Councils at Gloucester in 1175 and Oxford in 1177 and was the only Welsh ruler to be
involved.

Question 4b

To what extent do Item 2 and Item 3 persuade you that Rhys ap Gruffudd was successful between 1170 and 1189?

Item 2: David Ross, a historian, writing in his general-interest history book Wales, History of a Nation (2005)

When Lord Rhys [ap Gruffudd] established his rule in Ceredigion, he took over patronage of the newly built abbey at Strata Florida. It
was rebuilt, enlarged and given large amounts of land. Welsh lords and princes would come here in their old age to prepare for death
and burial. Strata Florida became the most important abbey in Wales.

Item 3: An anonymous author, writing in the entry for 1176 in Brut y Tywysogion a Welsh translation of a lost Latin text Chronicle of the
Princes of Wales. It is likely that the translation was made by Welsh monks at the abbey of Strata Florida.

And then Lord Rhys held a special feast at Cardigan and he set two kinds of contests. One between the bards and poets, and another
between the harpists, the pipers and other players of stringed instruments. And he set two chairs for the winners of these contests. He
also made them rich with great gifts.

Indicative Content

Marks

[20]

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be
acceptable.

•  The items are persuasive because both suggest that Rhys enjoyed some successes between 1170 and 1189. Item 2 refers to how he

managed to establish his rule in Ceredigion and was able to benefit from the prestige that patronage of Strata Florida afforded him. This
cultural dimension is also highlighted in Item 3, which shows that he established the Eisteddfod in South Wales by setting up literary and
musical contests.

•  However, more persuasive is the idea that Rhys was successful because of his relationship with Henry II, who gave him the position of

•

Justiciar in 1172. Henry also invited him to attend the Royal Councils at Gloucester and Oxford in 1175 and 1177 respectively.
Item 2, which is a modern interpretation, offers an overview of the period. Written by a historian, it may be argued to offer a credible analysis
of Rhys, with the caveat that as it is from a general-interest history book, which covers the history of Wales, it would necessarily offer only a
brief overview of this period. Regardless, as it is from a history book that focuses on the history of Wales, the author will likely understand the
importance of abbeys in the history of Wales.

•

Item 3, on the other hand, is a contemporary source, and the argument that Rhys was successful is lent credence by the suggestion that he
was successful in bringing about a cultural innovation. However, it will likely be noted that his successes would be stressed in an account
written by the monks of an Abbey he was patronising. It may also be noted that, as this is from 1176, Item 3 can only provide a partial account
of his achievements across the period (in fact, as an entry in a chronicle, it would only refer to that one year). Furthermore, this item is a
translation of a lost Latin document and the veracity of the translation is impossible to gauge.

•  Overall, the items are persuasive, to a point, that Rhys enjoyed some successes at this time, as they indicate the cultural achievements Rhys
made. Allied with his good relationship with Henry II of England, it will likely be concluded that the period from 1170 to 1189 was a period of
success for Rhys ap Gruffudd.

Question 6

Explain why support from outside of Wales was important to Owain Glyndwr during his reign as Prince of Wales.

Indicative Content

[10]

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be
acceptable.

•

•  Outside support helped Owain Glyndwr to win important battles such as Stalling Down [Bryn Owain] in 1403, where French and Welsh forces
fought side by side. Owain Glyndwr was fortunate that this was a time when England, his main threat, had a lot of enemies who wanted to him
gain an advantage over Henry IV. England was in the middle of the prolonged Hundred Years’ War with France at this time.
International support also secured Glyndwr recognition as Prince of Wales, which was why foreign envoys from France, Scotland and Spain
attended his 1404 parliament in Machynlleth. French and Scottish ships patrolled the coast of Wales attacking English bases and reducing the
risk of a large-scale attack from the sea against Glyndwr. The 1406 Penal letter saw Glyndwr propose joint action with France against the
English which would have helped him to maintain the momentum of his revolt, just as his military campaigns in Wales began to falter.
•  Outside support from factions within England also helped to support Glyndwr’s push for independence and assert his rule over Wales. The

Percy family felt a lack of recognition and reward for their role in recent wars with Scotland, while Edmund Mortimer had a claim of his own to
the throne of England. The 1405 Tripartite Indenture saw Glyndwr receive support from the English lords Henry Percy and Mortimer to divide
the kingdom between them, showing how serious their support for this cause was.

Describe the mystery surrounding Owain Glyndwr’s death.

Indicative Content

Total
Marks

[5]

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is
not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

•  Little is known directly about Owain Glyndwr after his disappearance in 1414, although it is
known that he rejected pardons from Henry IV and his successor Henry V, even though
these rejections came through third parties. His death was reported by one of his followers in
1415 but this was never formally confirmed.

•  Glyndwr’s burial place is unknown – some people think Glyndwr is buried near Corwen

where his estates had been, others say he is buried in Herefordshire where his daughters
had married local landowners.

•  There are lots of folk tales about how Glyndwr disguised himself and lived out his final years
in peace. Some people believed that a chaplain called Jack of Kent was Glyndwr in disguise,
others think he pretended to be a monk so he could teach his daughter Alys’s children.

Question 7b

How valuable is Item 1 to our understanding of the last years of Owain Glyndwr’s revolt?

Item 1: An unknown author writing in the article “Final days of Owain Glyndwr” on the website of the Owain Glyndwr Society
(updated in 2017)

By 1412 Glyndwr had lost control of most of the territory he had previously held. Some areas were still defiant, but not enough to
provide effective resistance. An exception to this was Meirionnydd, where the English crown had difficulty in exerting its control,
and resistance continued until Glyndwr's death.

[15]

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be
acceptable.

•  The item is valuable to an understanding of the last years of Owain Glyndwr’s revolt as it explains that that while the English had

recaptured a lot of the territory that had fallen to the Welsh during Glyndwr’s revolt, there were still some places that resisted English
control. However, its value is limited as there is no detail about what the English armies or the Welsh rebels were doing at this time, nor
does it mention Glyndwr’s final act of ransoming Dafydd Gam, a supporter of the king, in 1412, nor does it mention the fate of his allies
such as Mortimer, who had been captured by the English at this point.

•  The item also has value in that it states that Meirionnydd continued to resist English control. But this too is undermined by the lack of

detail about the means by which it was resisting or how effective this resistance ultimately was.

•  The information this item – which is an interpretation – includes is accurate, which could be expected from a website dedicated to the

•

history of an important individual. However, it is not clear whether the author is an amateur or professional historian, nor is it clear what
methodology has been used to arrive at this information, although this may be expected from a website.
It may also be suggested that the interpretation’s value is enhanced by someone with a passionate interest in Owain Glyndwr, who is
motivated to find out everything they possibly can about him. On the other hand, the views expressed might be undermined by looking
more favourably on Glyndwr’s actions than someone who was studying him from a more neutral perspective.

•  Overall, it could be suggested that the item is valuable in that it provides some accurate summary of how Glyndwr’s revolt gradually

petered out, although its lack of specific details may be argued to be limiting factors that make it less, rather than more, valuable to our
understanding of this issue.

Describe the Battle of Mynydd Hyddgen.

Indicative Content

Total
Marks

[5]

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material
is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

•

In June 1401, 1 500 English soldiers supported by Flemish mercenaries invaded
Ceredigion looking for Owain Glyndwr’s supporters. They met around 500 of them at
Mynydd Hydgen, twenty miles from Aberystwyth in the Cambrian Mountains.

•  The armoured infantry and cavalry of the English struggled to fight the Welsh archers

who had moved up into the mountains to slow down the English attack. The Welsh fired
arrows into the tight English formation from a distance. The English struggled to retreat
due to the marshy terrain.

•  As a result of the battle, there were at least 200 English soldiers killed, wounded or

captured. It was a major defeat for the English as they had superior numbers but still lost
the battle.

Question 8b

To what extent do Item 2 and Item 3 persuade you that Henry IV's policies led to increased support in Wales for the Welsh Revolt?

Total
Marks

[20]

Item 2: An extract from the Penal Laws against the Welsh passed by Henry IV’s Parliament in 1402.

It is ordered that no Englishman be convicted by any Welshman but by Englishmen.
It is ordered that no Welshman shall be armed upon pain of imprisonment.
It is ordered that no Welshman shall have his own castle, fortress nor defended house.

Item 3: Gideon Brough, a university lecturer in medieval History, writing in his academic book The Rise and Fall of Owain Glyndwr –
England, France and the Welsh Rebellion in the Late Middle Ages (2017)

The Battle of Bryn Glas in 1402 had a significant impact on support for the Welsh Revolt. This showed that the Welsh were organised,
well prepared, and well led, and that they were following a plan that was working. The English lost a lot of men and their equipment was
used to strengthen the Welsh military. The revolt grew in strength and began to overwhelm the English army and the English government
in Wales.

Indicative Content

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be
acceptable.
•  The items are persuasive because both suggest reasons why support for Owain Glyndwr’s revolt increased amongst Welsh people. Item 2
refers to the penal laws passed by Henry IV’s parliament, which placed severe restrictions on the lives of the Welsh people and those in
England who had contact with them. This is also highlighted in Item 3, which shows that Henry IV’s plan to beat the rebels militarily failed and
the defeat at Bryn Glas inspired more people to join the rebels.

•  However, more persuasive is idea that it was actually the successes of Glyndwr’s revolt that inspired people to join his rebellion, as a result of

•

•

victories such as the swift capture of Conwy Castle or military victories such as Mynydd Hyddgen or Bryn Glas.
Item 2 is a contemporary source, and the argument that Henry IV’s policies helped increase support for Glyndwr is lent credence by the
suggestion that these laws were very severe in the restrictions they imposed on the Welsh and could readily be seen to inspire anger against
England as a result. However, it will likely be noted that this can only be inferred by the nature of what is contained in the penal laws as it does
not give any information about how the Welsh reacted to these laws. It may also be noted that, as this is from an Act of Parliament, Item 2 can
only provide a partial account of what may have inspired people to support Glyndwr.
Item 3, on the other hand, is a modern interpretation which would be able to offer an effective overview of the period. Written by a historian, it
may be argued to offer a credible analysis of the reasons for increasing support for Glyndwr’s rebellion, with the caveat that as it is from a

Welsh history book, as it would probably only be offering an opinion from a Welsh perspective. Regardless, as it is from a history book that
focuses on Glyndwr the author will likely understand the motivations of those who supported him.

•  Overall, the items are persuasive that Henry IV’s policies made a contribution to increased support for Glyndwr’s rebellion, as they indicate

reasons for the Welsh to be resentful towards the English. It will likely be concluded that Henry IV’s actions did inspire people to join Glyndwr’s
revolt.
