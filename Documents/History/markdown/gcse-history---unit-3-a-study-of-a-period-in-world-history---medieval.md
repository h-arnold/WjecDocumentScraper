#### Answer all questions in **either** Section A **or** Section B

## **Section A**

#### **3.1 The Vikings, c.750–c.1066**

- Describe Viking relations with the Arab world. **[5] 0 1**
- Explain why the Great Heathen Army invaded mainland Britain. **[10] 0 2**
- This is a two-part question. Answer part (a) then part (b). Part (b) must be answered in continuous text.  **0 3**
  - **a)** Describe the end of Viking rule in England in 1042. **[5]**
  - **b)** Compare **and** contrast Item 1 and Item 2 as evidence for a historian studying Harald Hardrada's loss at the Battle of Stamford Bridge**. [15]**

#### **Item 1** Frank McLynn, a historian, writing in his general interest History book *1066: The Year of the Three Battles* (1999)

Harald Hardrada made two bad decisions. First, he allowed his men to proceed to the Stamford Bridge dangerously underequipped. They left their shields, helmets, coats of mail and spears on their ships, taking only a few bows and arrows. Then, supremely overconfident, Harald decided that only one in three of the army should accompany him, so that about 5 000 troops were on the march with him and others were left behind on board ship. … Harald's death in battle was the perfect ending to the career of a great Norse warrior. But immediately afterwards it went quiet as his followers were unsure what to do next.

## **Item 2** Henry Huntingdon, an English historian writing in *The Chronicle of Henry Huntingdon* (c.1129)

Harold of England [Harold Godwinson] advanced with a powerful army and reached the invaders at Stamford Bridge. The armies fought from daybreak to noon when the Norwegians were forced to give way before the superior numbers of the English, but they retreated in good order. Being driven across the river they made a fresh stand. Here, a single unnamed Norwegian stopped the English army from crossing the bridge until, at last, someone came under the bridge in a boat and thrust a spear into him through the gaps in the flooring. Harald Hardrada and the whole army were either slaughtered, taken prisoner or burnt.

  - **a)** Describe the Viking raid on the Isle of Sheppey in 835. **[5]**

**b)** Evaluate the view in **Item 3** that attacks on the British mainland were the most significant event in Viking westward expansion. **[20]**

**Item 3**

Elizabeth Hallam, a research professor, and Andrew Prescott, a curator at the British Library, writing in the commentary for their book *The British Inheritance: a Treasury of Historic Documents*  (1999)

From the late eighth century, all of Britain was subject to Viking attack. In Wales, the impact was limited to the coast, but England and Scotland were transformed. In Scotland, the northern islands and the Western Isles became Viking colonies. All the ancient English kingdoms were overrun except Wessex, and there was extensive Scandinavian settlement in the north and east. The Viking attacks gave a strong motivation for [English] political union.

Part (b) must be answered in continuous text. **(a)** Describe the Council of Clermont. **[5] (b)** Compare **and** contrast Item 1 and Item 2 as evidence to a historian studying how the First Crusade came to be organised. **[15] 0 5 0 6 0 7**

#### **Item 1** RHC [Ralph] Davis, a professor of Medieval History, writing in an academic history book *A History of Medieval Europe* (1957)

In 1071, the Byzantines were beaten at the Battle of Manzikert, losing large areas of their land to the Muslim Turks. The Byzantine Emperor was in despair and appealed to the Pope for help from the West. He received a sympathetic response from Pope Gregory VII, who hoped that this would provide an opportunity for the reunion of the Christian Churches, which had been divided since 1054.

#### **Item 2** Pope Urban II, writing in a letter to his supporters in Bologna (19 September 1096)

We have heard that many of you desire to go to Jerusalem, which you should understand pleases me. Any men among you that go there for the salvation of their souls and the freedom of the Church will be rewarded. Acting through the mercy of almighty God and the prayers of the Catholic Church, I forgive their sins if they have made genuine and full confession. This is because they have risked their belongings and lives for the love of God and their neighbour.

- This is a two-part question. Answer part (a) then part (b). Part (b) must be answered in continuous text.  **0 8**
  - **(a)** Describe the siege of Acre (1291). **[5]**

**(b)** Evaluate the view in **Item 3** that the Crusades were unsuccessful because of divisions among the Christian rulers. **[20]**

## **Item 3**

Austin Cline, an author focusing on the study of atheism, writing in the article "The Military and Political Effects of the Crusades" on the educational website *Learn Religions* (2019)

One of the things which helped prevent the Crusades from being successful was this constant bickering and infighting. There was, of course, plenty of that among Muslim leaders as well, but in the end, the divisions among European Christians were worse and caused more problems when it came to preparing effective military campaigns in the East.

#### **MARK SCHEME**

#### **Guidance for examiners**

#### **Generic marking principles**

- Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
- Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.
- Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
- Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

#### **Positive marking**

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising him/her for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates' answers. The list is not exhaustive. The inclusion of *'Credit any other valid response.*' (or similar instruction) within mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates' responses. Credit should be given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates' answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However, unless there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks where the answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

#### **Banded mark schemes**

For band-marked questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in candidates' answers. It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate's response. As noted above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive and candidates do not have to include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been provided, no marks should be awarded.

{9}------------------------------------------------

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each candidate's response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills, knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors or omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate's answer to pick out the evidence that is being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied. This is done as a two-stage process.

#### **Stage 1 – Deciding on the band**

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate's answer and check whether it matches the descriptors for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the descriptors match the answer.

If an answer covers different aspects of different bands within the mark scheme, a 'best fit' approach should be adopted to decide on the band and then the candidate's response should be used to decide on the mark within the band. For instance, if a response is mainly in band 2 but with a limited amount of band 3 content, the answer would be placed in band 2, but the mark awarded would be close to the top of band 2 as a result of the band 3 content.

Examiners should not seek to mark candidates down as a result of small omissions in minor areas of an answer.

#### **Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark**

During standardising (the marking conference), detailed advice from the Principal Examiner on the qualities of each mark band will be given. Examiners will then receive examples of answers in each mark band that have been awarded a mark by the Principal Examiner. Examiners should mark the examples and compare their marks with those of the Principal Examiner.

When marking, examiners can use these examples to decide whether a candidate's response is of a superior, inferior or comparable standard to the example. Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the answer as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the response provided.

| Question 1 |  | Total marks |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------|
|            | Describe Viking relations with the Arab world. | [5]            |

#### **Indicative Content**

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- One of the key relationships was built around trade, and trade routes connected Northern Europe with the Arab world. The Vikings traded furs, slaves, honey and amber in return for silk, spiced and luxury goods from the Arab world. Arab silver coins were found in large quantities in Viking hoards showing its importance to the Viking economy.
- The broader economic relationship also enabled wealth generation along the Silk Route, which contributed to the economic development of Viking society. The construction of towns, ships and military expeditions were, in part, funded by these economic relationships. Baghdad in particular was an attractive destination for Viking traders looking to develop those relationships.
- Relations also evolved around cultural developments, with the Vikings adopting technologies such as metallurgy and navigation techniques from the Arab world.

| Question 2 | Total marks |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Explain why the Great Heathen Army invaded mainland Britain. | [10]           |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- One of the reasons why the Great Heathen Army invaded mainland Britain was because it was a natural continuation of previous raids on the territory, for example those that followed the raid on Lindisfarne in 793. Through these earlier raids, Vikings had been able to fulfil their desire for wealth and resources, especially from monasteries and towns. The island also gave them access to fertile land, which was limited in Denmark and enabled them to permanently settle.
- A further reason was the timing of the arrival of the Army: there was political instability in Britain in the mid-ninth century with the rivalry between the different Saxon kingdoms at an especially volatile time: Northumbria and Mercia were weakening, and Wessex was growing in strength. Given the lack of unity on the British mainland, the Vikings saw this as an opportune moment, as the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were clearly not prepared for a full-scale invasion.
- There was also a personal motive for the invasion: some Norse Sagas state that the leaders, for example, Ivar the Boneless, Ubba and Halfdan Ragnarsson, the sons of Ragnar Lodbrok, were motivated by a desire to avenge the death of their father. However, it may be that this was less about revenge and more about them achieving fame and fortune, for which the invasion provided an excellent opportunity.

| Question 3(a) | Total marks |
|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Describe the end of Viking rule in England in 1042. |  |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- Viking rule in England came to an end with the death of Harthacnut in 1042. He died with no direct heir and was the last Dane to rule England.
- There was a power vacuum after Harthacnut's death, which enabled the English nobles to seize more power. Harthacnut had made, possibly informal, agreements with other Vikings to succeed him, which alarmed the English, who invited Harthacnut's half-brother, Edward the Confessor, to become the next king of England.
- Edward the Confessor's accession allowed for the return of the House of Wessex to the English throne; however, the lack of an heir – and thus no direct line of succession – led to future challenges and, in 1066, invasion.

| Compare and contrast Item 1 and Item 2 as evidence for a historian studying Harald Hardrada's loss at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. | [15] |  |
| Item 1 Frank McLynn, a historian, writing in his general interest History book 1066: The Year of the Three Battles (1999) |  |  |
| Harald Hardrada made two bad decisions. First, he allowed his men to proceed to the Stamford Bridge dangerously underequipped. They left their shields, helmets, coats of mail and spears on their ships, taking only a few bows and arrows. Then, supremely overconfident, Harald decided that only one in three of the army should accompany him, so that about 5 000 troops were on the march with him and others were left behind on board ship Harald's death in battle was the perfect ending to the career of a great Norse warrior.

{15}------------------------------------------------

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

#### **Comparisons:**

- Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that the Norwegians rather than the Danes were now the forces that were threatening England.
- Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that Harald Hardrada was one of the threats to England that the English nobles had feared in the aftermath of the death of Harthacnut in 1042.
- Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that the Vikings were, by 1066, less effective than the English, which may explain why there was no revival of Viking power in England after 1042.
- Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that Harald Hardrada was killed at the Battle of Stamford Bridge.
- Both Item 1 and Item 2 are written from an English perspective.

#### **Contrasts:**

- Item 1 partially lays the blame on Harald Hardrada for his loss at Stamford Bridge whereas Item 2 emphasises the superiority of the English forces.
- Item 1 states that the Norwegians were ineffective in their tactics; however, Item 2 suggests that they maintained good order.
- Item 1 states that the Norwegians had fewer men due to a bad decision made by Harald whereas Item 2 only states that the English had superior numbers.
- Item 1 states that the Norwegians were unsure what to do after the death of Harald, whereas Item 2 suggests that there was no time for indecision as they were immediately slaughtered. There was no successful Viking attack after the death of Harthacnut in 1042.
- Item 1 is an extract from a book focusing on events in 1066 written by a historian whereas Item 2 is a contemporary source written just a few decades after the battle.

| Describe the Viking raid on the Isle of Sheppey in 835. |                |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- The raid on Sheppey was one of the earliest recorded Viking raids on English soil, its location making it especially vulnerable to attack.
- The Vikings used long ships that could navigate the coastal waters and estuaries which allowed them to strike inland using hit and run tactics that reduced the numbers of Viking casualties. The speed of these attacks made it difficult for locals to put together an effective defence.
- The effects of the raid were several: property, including churches and monasteries, was destroyed, valuable goods such as gold, silver and livestock were seized, and many inhabitants were killed, captured or forced to flee.

| Item 3 | Elizabeth Hallam, a research professor, and Andrew Prescott, a curator at the British Library, writing in the commentary for their book The British Inheritance: a Treasury of Historic Documents (1999) |  |

All the ancient English kingdoms were overrun except Wessex, and there was extensive Scandinavian settlement in the north and east. The Viking attacks gave a strong motivation for [English] political union. |  |  |

In reaching a judgement, candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- The view expressed in Item 3, that attacks on the British mainland were the most significant event in Viking westward expansion, has some credibility. As the item states, all of Britain was affected by the Viking attacks, albeit to different degrees, with only Wales and Wessex being less affected than England and Scotland. Wales's coastal areas were more susceptible than inland areas, and Wessex avoided being overrun altogether.
- The British mainland provided a strategic position for launching voyages into the Atlantic. Once the Vikings had gained access to Britain, they were increasingly able to settle on the island and use it as a trade network connecting Scandinavia, the British and Irish Isles and beyond.
- With the difficulties the Vikings faced in raiding northern France, due to the successful attempts of Charles the Bald to repel them, the island of Britian gave them an opportunity and launchpad to expand westwards.
- The item is an extract from a commentary written by academics from a position of hindsight and therefore should have some validity as they would have researched the topic.
- However, candidates may challenge the view by emphasising other factors. For example, the Vikings' successes in moving westwards may also be attributed to them establishing key bases and settlements in Ireland, such as Dublin, Waterford and Limerick. The wealth gained from raids in these areas contributed significantly to Viking resources which sustained further expansion, which Ireland's geographical location also facilitated. Seafaring around the Irish Sea improved Viking navigation.
- Further, Spain gave the Vikings access to the Mediterranean Sea allowing them to use Byzantine trade routes and use those cultural exchanges to enhance Viking shipbuilding and navigation techniques, thus improving their ability for long distance travel.

{20}------------------------------------------------

• Candidates may conclude by agreeing with the view that attacks on the British mainland were the most significant event in Viking westward expansion, suggesting that they were the key launchpad. Or they may conclude that one of the other regions attacked by the Vikings were more significant, due to the factors stated above. They may, alternatively, suggest that the evidence does not fully support the assertion either way, and that the attacks on the British mainland were no more, nor no less, significant an event in Viking westward expansion.

#### **Indicative Content**

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- Salah ad-Din unified Muslim opposition to the crusaders under his leadership. He was flexible with tactics ranging from conventional warfare to guerrilla tactics, making the Muslim forces more adaptable and able to respond swiftly to challenges posed by crusaders.
- He captured key Crusader fortresses, for example during the siege of Jerusalem in 1187, and his forces defeated the Crusader army in the Battle of Hattin, 1187.
- Salah ad-Din was effective in his use of diplomacy, for example he was lenient in surrender terms after the capture of Jerusalem, which undermined Crusader morale. The Treaty of Jaffa, 1192, shows his willingness to negotiate with Crusaders, whilst still maintaining Muslim control of lands.

| Explain why the Siege of Damascus failed in 1148. | [10]           |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- The crusaders made strategic mistakes as divisions among the leaders led to inefficient co-ordination and planning. The leaders, King Louis VII of France, Conrad III of Germany and Baldwin III of Jerusalem, lacked a clear strategy, which hindered their ability to maintain a prolonged siege. They initially attacked a vulnerable side of the city but weakened their position by moving to a more fortified area.
- Furthermore, the siege failed as there was an effective Muslim defence. The use of archers and strategic retreats to the city walls made it difficult for the crusaders to breach the defences. Reinforcements from Nur ad-Din strengthened the city's defences and forced crusaders to abandon the siege.
- Crusader morale dropped when they did not achieve results quickly. The crusaders faced harsh conditions, including shortages of food and water, making it difficult to maintain the siege. Inadequate supplies led to many crusaders questioning the leadership of the crusade and their chances of success.

| Describe the Council of Clermont. |                |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- The Council of Clermont (1095) was a gathering of some 300 representatives of the Roman Catholic Church that met in Clermont in central France between 17 and 27 November 1095.
- The focus of the council was to address problems within the Roman Catholic Church, however, these were overshadowed by events in the eastern Mediterranean, which led to the speech, given by Pope Urban II, that is considered to have been the launchpad for the First Crusade.
- In his speech, Urban encouraged the warriors of France to take up arms and liberate the Holy City of Jerusalem and rescue the city's Eastern Christian inhabitants from the cruel treatment he alleged they were receiving at the hands of the Turks.

| Compare and contrast Item 1 and Item 2 as evidence to a historian studying how the First Crusade came to be organised. |  | [15] |
| Item 1 | RHC [Ralph] Davis, a professor of Medieval History, writing in an academic history book A History of Medieval Europe (1957) |  |
| In 1071, the Byzantines were beaten at the Battle of Manzikert, losing large areas of their land to the Muslim Turks. The Byzantine Emperor was in despair and appealed to the Pope for help from the West. He received a sympathetic response from Pope Gregory VII, who hoped that this would provide an opportunity for the reunion of the Christian Churches, which had been divided since 1054. |  |  |
| Item 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Pope Urban II, writing in a letter to his supporters in Bologna (19 September 1096)                                            |                |
| We have heard that many of you desire to go to Jerusalem, which you should understand pleases me. Any men among you that go there for the salvation of their souls and the freedom of the Church will be rewarded. Acting through the mercy of almighty God and the prayers of the Catholic Church, I forgive their sins if they have made genuine and full confession. This is because they have risked their belongings and lives for the love of God and their neighbour. |  |  |

{27}------------------------------------------------

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

#### **Comparisons:**

- Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate that the Papacy instigated the Crusades.
- Both Item 1 and Item 2 indicate the significance, power and influence of the Pope. Item 1 emphasises his political significance, particularly with reference to the recent split between the Western and Eastern Churches, and Item 2 emphasises his religious significance, promising the remission of sins, which was important in society at this time.
- Both Item 1 and Item 2 imply that the Christian Church needed to be freed.
- Both Item 1 and Item 2 are written from a clearly Western perspective.

#### **Contrasts:**

- Item 1 states that the cause of the First Crusade was the result of the Byzantine request for military support, whereas Item 2 states it was a result of a religious appeal by Pope Urban.
- Item 1 emphasises the geopolitical motivations for resisting the expansion of the Muslim Turks into the Byzantine Empire whereas Item 1 is more explicitly focused on motives based on faith and salvation.
- Item 1 offers a more objective account from a book written about the history of medieval Europe, whereas Item 2 is written by Pope Urban and shows his method of encouraging people to go on crusade.
- Item 1 may be seen as more objective it is written by a professor of History albeit less focused, as it is an extract from a book covering a large geographical area and timeframe. This may be suggested to limit the clarity and focus given to the outbreak of the First Crusade. Item 2, on the other hand, is a first-hand account of Urban II's rationale, and follows on from his appeal at the Council of Clermont the previous year.

| Describe the | siege of Acre (1291). | [5] |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- It began on 4 April 1291 and was led by Al-Ashraf, the Mamluk Sultan. He had carefully planned for the siege and had massive siege engines ready for the assault, alongside an army estimated to be around 100 000 soldiers.
- The siege lasted for several weeks, during which the Mamluks used their siege engines to bombard the city's fortifications. They broke through crucial points in Acre's outer walls. The defenders put up a strong resistance and held off the attackers but were unable to stop the city walls being breached.
- Acre fell on 18 May 1291, after which the Mamluks massacred many of the inhabitants. The remaining crusaders were forced to retreat to Cyprus, which was a turning point in the collapse of the crusader states.

|  | Evaluate the view in Item 3 that the Crusades were unsuccessful because of divisions among the Christian rulers. | [20] |
| Item 3 | Austin Cline, an author focusing on the study of atheism, writing in the article "The Military and Political Effects of the Crusades" on the educational website Learn Religions (2019) |  |
|  | One of the things which helped prevent the Crusades from being successful was this constant bickering and infighting. There was, of course, plenty of that among Muslim leaders as well, but in the end, the divisions among European Christians were worse and caused more problems when it came to mounting effective military campaigns in the East. |  |

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. This material is not prescriptive and other responses may be acceptable.

- The view expressed in Item 3 that the Crusades were unsuccessful because of divisions between rulers has some credibility. There was fighting and power struggles between the leaders, for example Richard the Lionheart and Phillip II during the Third Crusade, that led to poor decision making, a lack of unity and issues with military campaigns. As the crusaders came from various regions with different languages and customs, there was misunderstanding and distrust.
- Once established, the crusader states, such as the Kingdom of Jerusalem and Principality of Antioch, operated independently. Each state had its own leadership which led to disputes between rulers over land and resources.
- The item is an article taken from an educational website so should have some validity, however Austin Cline is an author who focuses on atheism and therefore not an expert on the crusades.
- However, candidates may challenge the view by emphasising other factors. For example, the crusaders were unsuccessful as Muslim leaders launched effective military campaigns, deployed a range of strategies, used the region's geography to their advantage and maintained control over key supplies. Muslim leaders formed coalitions which allowed them to launch coordinated military campaigns, for example at the Battle of Hattin, 1187.
- Furthermore, the crusaders were unsuccessful as the crusader kingdoms were too difficult to maintain. The distance from Europe to the Holy Land made it difficult to maintain reinforcements and supplies. The Crusaders relied on fortifications and military force to keep control, which alienated potential allies. The loss of Jerusalem in 1187 to Saladin showed the vulnerability of the Crusader kingdoms and attempts to impose Christianity and European culture led to tensions with local populations and difficulties maintaining control.

{32}------------------------------------------------

• Candidates may conclude by agreeing with the view that the Crusades were unsuccessful because of divisions among the Christian rulers, or they may argue that it was other factors, such as the effectiveness of Muslim campaigns that led to the crusaders' defeat. Others may conclude that the outcome was the consequence of a range of interrelated factors, of which division among Christian rulers was a significant part.
