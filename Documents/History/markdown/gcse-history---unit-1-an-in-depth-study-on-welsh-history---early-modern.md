## **Item 1**

John Simkin, a History teacher and author, writing in an article about King James VI of Scotland and I of England on his website *Spartacus Educational* (updated 2020)

The English view was that Scotland should be incorporated into England, the Scottish that the two kingdoms should be equal partners. The contemporary historian Sir Robert Cotton argued at the time that, previously, smaller kingdoms had joined to become the kingdom of England, so now the smaller kingdoms within the British Isles would come together under the ancient name of Britain.

  - **(b)** To what extent do **Item 2** and **Item 3** persuade you that Wales was important to the Royalists during the Civil War? **[20]**

| From a report by informers who had been sent to the House Item 2 of Commons to provide information to Parliamentary military commanders (5 April 1644) |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

We hear that 6 000 Irish rebels have landed in Wales. They are behaving in a cruel and savage way. Unless some speedy help is sent to Chirk, the whole country will be destroyed by these Irish invaders.

| Item 3 | Geraint Jenkins, a professor of Welsh History, writing in his academic book The Foundations of Modern Wales 1642– 1780 (1987) |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

From the outset it was vitally important for the king to control the borderlands. Wales could not only supply him with wealth, supplies and armies, but might also offer a route for loyal troops from Ireland if he needed them. Parliament was determined to break through the barrier of the Welsh Marches.

#### **MARK SCHEME**

#### **Guidance for examiners**

#### **Generic marking principles**

- Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
- Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.
- Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
- Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

#### **Positive marking**

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising him/her for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points based, the mark scheme should be applied precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates' answers. The list is not exhaustive. The inclusion of *'Credit any other valid response.*' (or similar instruction) within mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates' responses. Credit should be given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates' answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However, unless there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks where the answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

#### **Banded mark schemes**

For band-marked questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in candidates' answers. It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate's response. As noted above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive, and candidates do not have to include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been provided, no marks should be awarded.

{11}------------------------------------------------

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each candidate's response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills, knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors or omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate's answer to pick out the evidence that is being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied. This is done as a two-stage process.

#### **Stage 1 – Deciding on the band**

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate's answer and check whether it matches the descriptors for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the descriptors match the answer.

If an answer covers different aspects of different bands within the mark scheme, a 'best fit' approach should be adopted to decide on the band and then the candidate's response should be used to decide on the mark within the band. For instance, if a response is mainly in band 2 but with a limited amount of band 3 content, the answer would be placed in band 2, but the mark awarded would be close to the top of band 2 as a result of the band 3 content.

Examiners should not seek to mark candidates down as a result of small omissions in minor areas of an answer.

#### **Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark**

During standardising (the marking conference), detailed advice from the Principal Examiner on the qualities of each mark band will be given. Examiners will then receive examples of answers in each mark band that have been awarded a mark by the Principal Examiner. Examiners should mark the examples and compare their marks with those of the Principal Examiner.

When marking, examiners can use these examples to decide whether a candidate's response is of a superior, inferior or comparable standard to the example. Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the answer as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the response provided.

| Explain why Henry, Earl of Richmond had a claim to the English throne. | [10]        |

- Henry, Earl of Richmond's main claim to the English throne was that he was the heir to the Lancastrian line of monarchs, rivals to the Yorkists led by King Richard III. Henry's mother, Margaret Beaufort, was a descendent of John of Gaunt, father of King Henry IV, the first Lancastrian king. The disappearance of the nephews of Richard III, and the death of Richard III himself would improve this ancestral claim as he could argue he was the closest living relative to the old line of kings.
- Henry's claim to the throne was strengthened by the support of important individuals in England who rallied to his cause. His uncle Jasper Tudor was able to rally support for Henry when he landed at Milford Haven seeking to challenge Richard III for the throne. Leading nobles Thomas and William Stanley were neutral to begin with, but their support, especially on the battlefield at Bosworth, proved critical in securing Henry's claim to the throne.
- Henry also had a claim to the throne by marriage as, after his defeat of Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, he married Elizabeth of York, the daughter of Richard III's predecessor Edward IV. This meant that he was now the leading representative of both the Houses of York and Lancaster, ending the rivalry of the Wars of the Roses.

| Describe the problems facing Henry VIII in trying to control Wales between 1509 and 1531. |  | [5] |

- One of the problems facing Henry VIII in controlling Wales was that it was divided into two different kinds of territories – those directly under the control of the Crown, and those under control of the marcher lords who could raise their own taxes and even their own armies.
- The Council of the Marches, which had been established in the fifteenth century to help the English monarchy control the Marcher lords had not been very effective, which is why Marcher lords like the Herberts had been able to use their distance from London to exercise some independence.
- There was a lot of resentment amongst the Marcher lords and other Welsh nobles about royal interference in their affairs. When Henry VIII took control of one of the most powerful estates in Wales he gave the inheritance of Sir Rhys ap Gruffudd to Lord Ferrers, who was a friend and ally of the King. Sir Rhys ap Gruffudd then rebelled against Henry.

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| How valuable is Item 1 to our understanding of Henry VIII's relationship with Sir Rhys ap Gruffudd? |  |
| Item 1: Huw Llywelyn Rees writing on his personal Facebook blog The History of Wales (2021)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                |
| Sir Rhys ap Gruffudd was critical of Henry's relationship with Anne Boleyn, instead supporting both Katherine of Aragon and Cardinal Wolsey. Henry accused Rhys of treason on the charge of plotting with James V of Scotland to overthrow him and install himself as Prince of Wales. Rhys was found guilty and subsequently executed. |  |

- The item is valuable to our understanding of Henry VIII's relationship with Sir Rhys ap Gruffudd as it explains that Sir Rhys ap Gruffudd had been very critical of Henry VIII's choice of wife. However, its value is limited, as what it does not tell us about this is that Sir Rhys had rebelled against Henry VIII's decision to give his grandfather's inheritance to his rival Lord Ferrers
- The item also has value in that it states that Henry VIII had Sir Rhys ap Gruffudd executed for treason. But this too is undermined by the lack of explanation of Henry VIII's difficulties with a number of the marcher lords in Wales and that he was trying various means to increase his influence there, in this case by favouring a supporter in a legal dispute.
- The information this item which is an interpretation includes is potentially accurate, if its author Huw Llywelyn Rees has properly researched the subject. Although, as it is from his personal Facebook page there is no information about how he has found this information.
- It may also be suggested that the interpretation's value is enhanced by the author's clear interest in the history of Wales as it is the title of his Facebook page and clearly an interest for him. On the other hand, the views expressed might be undermined by this being a social media post with no indication of where this information came from nor how its accuracy might have been researched.
- Overall, it could be suggested that the item is valuable in that it provides information about why Sir Rhys ap Gruffudd had a poor relationship with Henry VIII. It may be argued that limiting factors such as the lack of background information or it being a social media post make it less, rather than more, valuable to our understanding of this issue.

| Outline the background to the introduction of the Acts of Union in 1536 and 1543. |  |

- English rule over Wales was not uniform as some parts of Wales were controlled by semiindependent Marcher Lords. Henry VIII was concerned that these lords were becoming too powerful, but also that they were failing to maintain law and order, which was the main reason they had been given their power. Rowland Lee was sent to try and restore law and order in Wales.
- Henry VIII was also concerned that the Marcher Lords would not properly enforce the Henrician Reformation and that Wales might become a centre of resistance to these changes. It could even have become the focus of a foreign invasion to overturn the Reformation.
- Henry's adviser Thomas Cromwell had a plan to increase royal power by putting all areas of Wales more directly under the control of the King. The new system would mean that government and the justice system would be the same in England and in Wales.

| To what extent do Item 2 and Item 3 persuade you that the Acts of Union had a positive impact on Wales? | [20] |
| Item 2:Lloyd Bowen, a historian, writing in his academic textbook Early Modern Wales c.1536–1689 (2022) |  |
| The Welsh were to enjoy the same rights and freedoms as the English. The counties and large towns of Wales were allowed to elect Members of Parliament to represent their communities at the centre of government in London. |  |
| Item 3:From the Act for the Government of Wales (1536) |  |
| No one that uses the Welsh language shall hold office in England, Wales or the King's other territories. Those who do will have to give up those offices unless they use the English language. |  |

- The items could persuade us that the Acts of Union had a positive impact on Wales, although they offer different perspectives on this issue. Item 2 refers to the political rights Welsh people gained as a result of the Acts of Union, particularly representation in Parliament. This is contradicted in Item 3, which shows that all officials would now have to conduct their business through the medium of English rather than in Welsh.
- However, more persuasive is idea that the Acts of Union brought an end to the lawlessness that had plagued areas of Wales under the control of the marcher lords and that more effective justice was available for everyone in Wales.
- Item 2, which is a modern interpretation, would be able to offer an overview of the period. Written by a historian, it may be argued to offer a credible analysis of the impact of the Act of Union, with the caveat that as it is from an academic book which covers the history of Wales between 1536 and 1689, it would necessarily offer only an overview of the period. Regardless, as it is from a history book that focuses on Wales in this period the author will likely understand both the background to the Acts of Union as well as the short and long term impact of them.
- Item 3, on the other hand, is a contemporary source, and the argument that the Acts of Union had a negative impact on Wales is lent credence by the suggestion that Welsh speakers would not be able to become officials in the new administration of Wales. However, it will likely be noted that while speaking English was essential to becoming an administrator, speaking Welsh was not being banned. It may also be noted that, as this is from 1536, Item 3 can only provide a partial account of the Acts of Union as it gives no indication as to what happened when they were implemented.

{20}------------------------------------------------

• It will likely be concluded that, overall, it is possible to be persuaded either that the items do or do not support the argument that there was a positive impact on Wales, or that the impacts were positive in some ways and negative in others.

|------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Explain why the monarchy was restored in 1660. | [10]           |

- One of the most important reasons for the 1660 Restoration was that politicians were divided about who should take over after Cromwell died in 1658. Oliver Cromwell was succeeded as ruler of the republic by his son Richard. The irony was not lost on his opponents – that the man who had so strongly opposed the idea of a return to a monarchy had wanted his son to succeed him. Richard was not well suited to being a leader, so Lords and MPs began to plot against him. Richard Cromwell quickly stood down and returned his powers to Parliament.
- It was not just disagreement over who should run the Republic, as this situation now gave hope to those who had continued to support the monarch, even after the Royalists had been defeated. Support for the Stuart monarchy had continued amongst many of the Welsh gentry and the ordinary people of Wales throughout the period of the Republic. Support for the Stuarts in Wales can be seen by the 1659 declaration, that Charles II was rightful king, by Thomas Myddleton of Chirk, a former supporter of Parliament who had become disillusioned after the execution of the king and harsh rule of Cromwell's Republic.
- Finally, Royalist supporters led by General Monck defeated the MPs trying to continue the Republic and invited Charles II to return to be king. In the Declaration of Breda, Charles II promised a pardon for those who had opposed his father so that he did not face opposition from them when he returned from exile in the Netherlands. Parliament officially declared Charles II as monarch, and he returned to London in 1660 to be crowned.

| Describe the religious problems facing James I in his kingdoms. |  | [5] |

- Religion was one of the problems that James had ruling his kingdoms as his attempts to bring the different branches of religion in his different kingdoms alienated extremists on both sides. He introduced a new version of the Bible in 1611 to try and solve these problems.
- Catholics were angered by continuing to be fined for not attending Protestant church services which led to the Gunpowder Plot, an attempt by a group of Catholic terrorists to blow up the King and the House of Lords to re-establish Catholic rule in England.
- Puritans were angered by the imposition of the King James Bible, a new official version that they did not like, which was to be used in all churches. This was particularly a problem for James in Scotland as the vast majority of Scottish people were members of the Puritan state church.

| How valuable is Item 1 to our understanding of the reasons why James I had problems ruling his kingdoms? | [15] |
| Item 1: John Simkin, a History teacher and author, writing in an article about King James, VI of Scotland and I of England on his website Spartacus Educational (updated 2020) |  |
| The English view was that Scotland should be incorporated into England, the Scottish that the two kingdoms should be equal partners. The contemporary historian Sir Robert Cotton argued at the time that, previously, smaller kingdoms had joined to become the kingdom of England, so now the smaller kingdoms within the British Isles would come together under the ancient name of Britain. |  |

- The item is valuable to an understanding of the reasons why James I had problems ruling his kingdoms as it explains that James wanted to treat both of his kingdoms as if they were the same kingdom, which he wanted to call Britain. However, its value is limited as is gives no indication as to what other politicians thought of this issue of how to treat the kingdoms of England and Scotland now they were ruled by the same monarch.
- The item also has value in that it states that England and Scotland should be treated as equal partners, but this too is undermined by the rising power and greater wealth of England compared to Scotland, potentially making a plan to treat them as equals likely to fail.
- The information this item which is an interpretation includes is accurate, as would be expected from a History teacher and author who would have done research before writing and publishing this information online. It is, however, brief and lacking detail as would be expected for an educational website.
- It may also be suggested that the interpretation's value is enhanced by it being from a website dedicated to history education, suggesting its author would have tried to make the information as accurate and relevant as possible. On the other hand, the views expressed might be undermined by the need to simplify the information being presented as would be needed for an educational audience.
- Overall, it could be suggested that the item is valuable in that it provides an educationalist's view on the history of James I's issues with how to deal with both of the kingdoms he was now ruler of. Or, it may be argued to be limiting factors, such as it being written for an educational website, that make it less, rather than more, valuable to our understanding of this issue.

- Many of the men from Wales who fought in the Civil War fought on the Royalist side. 1000 Welsh soldiers were killed at the battle of Edgehill, although the outcome of the battle did not provide a clear and definite result. Welsh soldiers also played an important role in the first battle of Newbury in 1643, although this battle was also inconclusive.
- Welsh landowners who got involved in the Civil War were mostly raising troops for the King, although there was a lot of support for Parliament in Pembrokeshire and amongst puritans such as Thomas Myddleton of Chirk Castle.
- Men from Wales were employed as foot soldiers in Civil War battles where they would fight either as pikemen or musketeers.

| To what extent do Item 2 and Item 3 persuade you that Wales was important to the Royalists during the Civil War? | [20] |
| Item 2: From a report by informers who had been sent to the House of Commons to provide information to Parliamentary military commanders (5 April 1644) |  |
| We hear that 6 000 Irish rebels have landed in Wales. They are behaving in a cruel and savage way. Unless some speedy help is sent to Chirk, the whole country will be destroyed by these Irish invaders. |  |
| Item 3: Geraint Jenkins, a professor of Welsh History, writing in his academic book The Foundations of Modern Wales 1642–1780 (1987)                                                                                                                                                                                 |                |
| From the outset it was vitally important for the king to control the borderlands. Wales could not only supply him with wealth, supplies and armies, but might also offer a route for loyal troops from Ireland if he needed them. Parliament was determined to break through the barrier of the Welsh Marches. |  |

- The items are persuasive because both suggest that Wales was of strategic importance during the Civil War. Item 2 refers to Wales being the route for Royalist supporters from Ireland to land in mainland Britain. This is also highlighted in Item 3, which shows not only Wales as a route for the Irish to join the war, but also that the King was able to get supplies and other troops from Wales as well.
- However, more persuasive is the idea that it was the castles of Wales providing strongholds for the Royalists that was of more strategic importance, or the strength of forces that could be commanded by parliamentarians such as Thomas Myddleton of Chirk that was of more strategic significance.
- Item 2 is a contemporary source, and the argument that Wales was strategically important to the Royalists is lent credence by the suggestion that the parliamentarians were concerned about the impact of Wales being a landing point for the King's Irish supporters. However, it will likely be noted that Item 2 is a report to Parliament to inform it how its forces should be fighting the war and could be an accurate report of a genuine concern, although it is not clear how accurately this threat from Ireland was being reported. It may also be noted that, as this is from a parliamentarian's account, Item 2 can only provide a partial account of the role of Wales in the Civil War.
- Item 3, on the other hand, is a modern interpretation would be able to offer an overview of the period. Written by a historian, it may be argued to offer a credible analysis of the strategic importance of Wales in the Civil War, with the caveat that as it is from a textbook which covers the history of Wales over nearly 150 years, it would necessarily offer only an overview of Welsh history in this period. Regardless, the author will

{29}------------------------------------------------

likely understand the role of Wales in the war.

• Overall, the items are persuasive that Wales was strategically important to the Royalists in the Civil War, as they indicate it was a main source of supplies and manpower, as well as being a route for Irish supporters. It will likely be concluded that Wales was strategically important to the Royalists, even though this was not enough to help them win.
