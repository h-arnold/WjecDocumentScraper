## Aims of the Delivery Guide

The aim of the Delivery Guide is to give an overview of the qualification and to help teachers understand how we assess the GCSE. It will offer an introduction to the specification, an assessment overview, and will support teachers in better understanding how to prepare their learners for the assessment of the different units. More information on each unit can be found in the separate unit guides.

## Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE History consists of four units:

| Unit                                               | title                      | Type of Assessment   | Weighting   |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| An in-depth study on Welsh history                 | Written examination        | 30%                  | Unit 1      |
| An in-depth study on European and/or World history | Non-examination assessment | 20%                  | Unit 2      |
| A study of a period in world history               | Written examination        | 30%                  | Unit 3      |
| A changing society                                 | Non-examination assessment | 20%                  | Unit 4      |

All units are compulsory. The combination of options selected for Units 1, 2 and 3 must include one medieval, one early modern and one modern unit.

In Unit 4, centres can choose to repeat a time period previously studied in Units 1, 2 or 3. However, the topics chosen for study in Unit 4 must not replicate or overlap with the content of any of the other selected units .

It would be most appropriate for learners to complete Unit 4 in the final year of the course as they revisit a time period previously studied in one of the earlier units. This would allow learners to implement their understanding of historical concepts and the analysis and evaluation skills they've developed throughout Units 1 and 3. It would also allow learners to build on the approaches and practices developed when undertaking an historical enquiry in Unit 2.

## Unit 1

The purpose of this unit is to provide an insight into the development of Wales at a specific point in time.

## Unit 2

The purpose of this unit is to provide an understanding of an issue in European and/or world history in depth via the study of historical sources and interpretations.



{6}------------------------------------------------



## Unit 3

The purpose of this unit is to provide an overview of an extended historical period enabling learners to explore key concepts.

## Unit 4

The purpose of this unit is to provide an insight into the different experiences of people through the study of themed events within an extended timeframe. The experiences of the people studied are limited to the islands of Great Britain and Ireland.

The unit will be based on the following concepts:

- continuity and change
- similarity and difference
- significance and impact
- cause and consequence.

## Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:

- Specification - this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to know by the end of their course
- Assessment Pack - this contains the Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) i.e.: sample exam papers and sample NEA tasks, relevant controls for the NEA and mark schemes.

This guide builds upon the information in the specification and assessment pack to help further your understanding of said documents.

## Understanding the specification amplification

Learners should be made aware of:

- the specification stems
- what the specification stems mean.

## Specification Stems

When you look through the specification you will notice in the amplification column, we use a variety of wording before the list of content learners need to know; we call this a stem:

<!-- image -->

|                    | Amplification    |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Specification Stem | Learners should: |

Each stem is used for a slightly different reason:

| Specification Stem          | When it is used                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Learners should be aware of | When learners do not need to understand all aspects of the specified content in detail. Teachers should refer to Guidance for Teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and breadth to which this content should be taught. |
| Learners should understand  | When learners are required to demonstrate and apply knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and can synthesise and evaluate information for a given purpose.                                                                      |
| Learners should be able to  | When learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to source material or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques.                                                                                        |



{11}------------------------------------------------



## Command words

Learners should be made aware of:

- what command words are
- what each command word means
- what each command word assesses.

Command words are the words and phrases used in assessments that indicate to learners the expectations of the question or task.

<!-- image -->

The following tables are not exhaustive, but will give you a good idea of the command words we typically use:

| Command words for direct recall   | Command words for direct recall                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Mark Schemes

Mark schemes and/or assessment criteria test the intended learning outcomes for a unit. They describe the knowledge and skills (and possibly attitude) that a candidate is expected to demonstrate in their responses and they are then used in marking the work.

## Objective based mark scheme:

For very short answer questions requiring one correct response.

| Question   | Question   | Answer                                           | AO1   | AO2   | AO3   | Total Mark   |
|------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|--------------|
| 1          | (a)        | Which castle was captured by Deheubarth in 1145? |       |       |       |              |
|            |            | Award one mark for: • Carmarthen .               | 1     |       |       | 1            |

## Levels based mark schemes:

For questions requiring extended responses

## Question 2

Explain why there was conflict in South Wales between 1146 and 1170.

## Indicative Content

Candidates may respond to the question by offering the following suggestions. The list is not exhaustive and other responses may be acceptable.

- The Normans had taken Deheubarth from Rhys ap Tewdwr in 1093 and his family had been fighting for its return since 1116
- On the death of Gruffudd ap Rhys his children, including Rhys ap Gruffudd, had continued to fight for the return of this territory
- The Norman lords lacked the support of a strong monarch in England to support them as the throne of England was contested until 1154
- There was ongoing competition with Gwynedd for territory as Owain Gwynedd was also taking advantage of Norman weakness to expand his territory
- The accession of Henry II to the throne in England in 1154 led to renewed attacks on the territories of Welsh rulers, including the invasion of Deheubarth in 1163
- In 1163 Rhys ap Gruffudd made an alliance against the English with Owain Gwynedd as part of a Welsh revolt against English invasions which resulted in successful campaigns for the Welsh and peace with Henry II by 1170.
