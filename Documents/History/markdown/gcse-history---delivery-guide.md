Aims of the Delivery Guide

The aim of the Delivery Guide is to give an overview of the qualification and to help teachers
understand how we assess the GCSE. It will offer an introduction to the specification, an
assessment overview, and will support teachers in better understanding how to prepare their
learners for the assessment of the different units. More information on each unit can be
found in the separate unit guides.

Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE History consists of four units:

Unit title

Type of Assessment

Weighting

Unit 1

An in-depth study on Welsh history  Written examination

Unit 2

An in-depth study on European
and/or World history

Non-examination
assessment

Unit 3

A study of a period in world history  Written examination

Unit 4

A changing society

Non-examination
assessment

30%

20%

30%

20%

All units are compulsory. The combination of options selected for Units 1, 2 and 3 must
include one medieval, one early modern and one modern unit.

In Unit 4, centres can choose to repeat a time period previously studied in Units 1, 2 or 3.
However, the topics chosen for study in Unit 4 must not replicate or overlap with the
content of any of the other selected units.

It would be most appropriate for learners to complete Unit 4 in the final year of the course as
they revisit a time period previously studied in one of the earlier units. This would allow
learners to implement their understanding of historical concepts and the analysis and
evaluation skills they’ve developed throughout Units 1 and 3. It would also allow learners to
build on the approaches and practices developed when undertaking an historical enquiry in
Unit 2.

Unit 1

The purpose of this unit is to provide an insight into the development of Wales at a specific
point in time.

Unit 2

The purpose of this unit is to provide an understanding of an issue in European and/or world
history in depth via the study of historical sources and interpretations.

Delivery Guide GCSE History 4

Unit 3

The purpose of this unit is to provide an overview of an extended historical period enabling
learners to explore key concepts.

Unit 4

The purpose of this unit is to provide an insight into the different experiences of people
through the study of themed events within an extended timeframe. The experiences of the
people studied are limited to the islands of Great Britain and Ireland.

The unit will be based on the following concepts:
•  continuity and change
•  similarity and difference
•  significance and impact
•  cause and consequence.

Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:
•  Specification – this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to

know by the end of their course

•  Assessment Pack – this contains the Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) i.e.: sample
exam papers and sample NEA tasks, relevant controls for the NEA and mark schemes.

This guide builds upon the information in the specification and assessment pack to help
further your understanding of said documents.

Understanding the specification amplification

Learners should be made aware of:
•
•  what the specification stems mean.

Specification Stems

When you look through the specification you will notice in the amplification column, we use a
variety of wording before the list of content learners need to know; we call this a stem:

Richard I of England

continued to fight for the return of this territory

•  The Norman lords lacked the support of a strong monarch in England to support them

as the throne of England was contested until 1154

•  There was ongoing competition with Gwynedd for territory as Owain Gwynedd was

also taking advantage of Norman weakness to expand his territory

•  The accession of Henry II to the throne in England in 1154 led to renewed attacks on

•

the territories of Welsh rulers, including the invasion of Deheubarth in 1163
In 1163 Rhys ap Gruffudd made an alliance against the English with Owain Gwynedd
