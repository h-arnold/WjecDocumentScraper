### Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE History consists of four units. The combination of options selected for Units 1, 2 and 3 must include one medieval, one early modern and one modern unit.

In Unit 4, centres can choose to repeat a time period previously studied in Units 1, 2 or 3. **However, the topics chosen for study in Unit 4 must not replicate or overlap with the content of any of the other selected units.**

The qualification is unitised and does not contain tiering. There is no hierarchy to the order the units should be taught.

### Scheme of Learning Option 3.5 Modern: Russia and the Soviet Union, c.1861–c.1953

This scheme of learning is provided as an illustrative example. It is designed to offer structure and inspiration but allows for adaptation to meet the unique needs, preferences, and dynamics of individual classes. Teachers are encouraged to modify elements as needed to align with their students' abilities and learning goals.

**For each section of content in this unit, WJEC is also providing blended learning resources and knowledge organisers. These can be found on:<https://resources.wjec.co.uk/>**

#### 3.5 Background: Tsardom in the late-nineteenth century

(Each option begins with a background section. These sections are intended to provide learners with necessary context in order to access the historical topic. Learners will not be directly assessed on the content of the background sections).

#### Cross-curricular Skills – Literacy

There are many opportunities to include literacy in GCSE History. These opportunities include the analysis of source material, extended writing opportunities, vocabulary development, debating and discussion. These opportunities are important to learners because they will develop cross-curricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the Curriculum for Wales, as well as communication skills which can be used across subjects and prepare them for future education or employment.

Below are some examples of how literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learners will have the opportunity to assess the accuracy and reliability of source material and share views through discussion and verbal questioning techniques when being taught the specification content.

##### Examples

##### Listening

- Learners are encouraged to debate and respond to the views of others.
- Learners will have opportunities to listen to podcasts and recordings in order to develop their vocabulary and listening skills.

Learners will have the opportunity to read contemporary source material as well as a variety of historical interpretations, before critically evaluating the sources, analysing their content, and comparing and

- Use of oral history and interviews develop listening skills and the ability to respond to others appropriately.
- Learners have the opportunity to share and respond to peer presentations.

contrasting sources focusing on the interpretation they give on events.

##### Examples

##### Reading

- Learners can use a range of reading techniques such as skimming and scanning or reading for a purpose.
- Reading extracts from a wide range of sources such as speeches, articles, diary extracts, historians and newspapers.
- Comparing and contrasting the content of historical sources.
- Assessing the reliability and accuracy of the text to develop the skill of critical reading.

#### Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy

There are many opportunities to include numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

##### Examples

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learning that statistics represent data, and that probability models chance, help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

##### Examples

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
- Secondary material such as graphs and charts can be interpreted.
- There are opportunities for learners to create their own numerical representations of data gathered.

#### Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competence

There are many opportunities to include digital competence in GCSE History. Learners can make use of digital technology to access a broad range of historical sources and to undertake research of a historical topic. Learners will also have the opportunity to develop their digital skills in preparing and completing their non-examination assessments. These opportunities will allow learners to develop crosscurricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as allowing further access to historical information while fostering current and future critical thinking and ethical awareness.

Below are some examples of how digital competence can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.
