resistance to the
Reformation in Wales,
including:
•  the conservatism of
many Welsh people
•  the significance of the
Welsh language and
the first Welsh book –
Yn y Llyfr Hwn, 1547.

Understand the reasons
for resistance to Welsh
reformation in Wales
because of Wales’
attachment to Catholic
traditions as a deeply
Catholic country.

The language barrier with
Welsh being the primary
language spoken by the
majority of the population
meant the Welsh could not
access the protestant
material that was mostly in
English. The early
Protestant clergy were
often non-Welsh speakers.

The first Welsh book – Yn
y Llyfr Hwn, included the
Apostles Creed, the Lord's
Prayer, and various other
Christian texts as well as
the alphabet and
instructions on how to read
Welsh for ordinary people
who could not read. This
was done to make
religious texts more
accessible to the Welsh
and to promote
Protestantism.

Interacting and
Collaborating

Learners can work collaboratively (digitally) on tasks in preparation for the exam. These could include peer
assessment, responding to teacher feedback or work creation.

Example

In groups, learners could research and present a topic to introduce an area of study.

interpretations, as well as to evaluate them as part of their process of developing relevant critical
arguments.
