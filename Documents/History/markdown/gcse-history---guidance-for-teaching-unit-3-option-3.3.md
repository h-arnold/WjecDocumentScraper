{31}------------------------------------------------

# **Integral Skills** Creativity and Innovation There are many opportunities to include Creativity and Innovation in GCSE History. These opportunities are important to learners to become more engaged in lessons and enjoy learning through stimulating tasks. Deeper understanding is developed through the encouragement for learners to take an active role in their learning. **Examples** • Learners will demonstrate creativity when developing responses, expressing their opinions about relevant historical issues and critically evaluating sources and evidence within assessments. • Learners have opportunities to be creative and innovative when presenting information and findings. Critical Thinking and Problem Solving There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE History.
