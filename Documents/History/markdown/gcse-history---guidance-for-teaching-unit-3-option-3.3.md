There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in
primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These
opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidence-
based conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy

Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry
helps us understand
shape, space and position
and learning about
measurement helps us
quantify in the real world

Learning that statistics
represent data, and that
probability models
chance, help us make
informed inferences and
decisions

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of
empires or the geographical representation of wars.

Examples

•  Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.

Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competence

There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE History.  Learners can make use of digital technology to access a
broad range of historical sources and to undertake research of a historical topic. Learners will also have the opportunity to develop their
digital skills in preparing and completing their non-examination assessments. These opportunities will allow learners to develop cross-
curricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as allowing further access to historical information while fostering
current and future critical thinking and ethical awareness.

Below are some examples of how Digital Competence can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learners will develop an understanding of the importance of attributions, including the use of resources in digital
formats such as e-books and online articles. Learners will be required to address attributions when analysing
items for their historical enquiry and to think critically about the authors of digital evidence.

Citizenship

Example

Learners should be made aware of copyright and plagiarism when looking at historical evidence and when
developing and presenting their own arguments in relation to a topic.

Interacting and
Collaborating

Learners can work collaboratively (digitally) on tasks in preparation for the exam. These could include peer
assessment, responding to teacher feedback or work creation.

Example

In groups, learners could research and present a topic to introduce an area of study.

Producing

Example

Learners have opportunities to research a variety of sources digitally.

•  Use of national and international archives to find source materials that link to the area of study.

Integral Skills

There are many opportunities to include Creativity and Innovation in GCSE History. These opportunities are
important to learners to become more engaged in lessons and enjoy learning through stimulating tasks. Deeper
understanding is developed through the encouragement for learners to take an active role in their learning.

Creativity and Innovation

Examples

•  Learners will demonstrate creativity when developing responses, expressing their opinions about relevant

historical issues and critically evaluating sources and evidence within assessments.

•  Learners have opportunities to be creative and innovative when presenting information and findings.

There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE History. These
opportunities are important to learners because they develop the ability to think analytically, and to collect,
reflect and critically evaluate evidence in order to make informed judgements on a range of topics. This skill can
be applied to real-life scenarios.

Examples

Critical Thinking and
Problem Solving

•  Learners will have opportunities to ask meaningful questions of source material and historical

interpretations, as well as to evaluate them as part of their process of developing relevant critical
arguments.

•  Learners will develop their ability to see issues from multiple viewpoints.
•  Studying continuity and change over time allows learners to develop their problem-solving skills that can be

applied in their future lives.

•  Learners will evaluate sources and historical interpretations in terms of reliability, bias and purpose.
•  Critical thinking and problem solving encourages independent learning and promotes the ability to come to

reasoned and informed decisions in other aspects of life such as further education or work.
