- the Spanish conquest of the Caribbean, including:
  - the peoples of the Caribbean – exploitation of the people and the land
  - reasons for Spanish expansion into Mexico.

The Taino and the Caribs (native peoples of the Caribbean).

The enslavement of the Indigenous Peoples to farm the land.

The lack of gold (identified by 1519) in the Caribbean and the appeal of central America.

#### **Activity**:

Groupwork presentation activity. Each group is given a different theme to research in relation to the Spanish conquest of the Caribbean, for example, the treatment of Indigenous Peoples, and then feeds back to the rest of the class. The rest of the class should take notes during the presentations.

#### **Outcome:**

Learners can demonstrate that they understand the way the Spanish took over the Caribbean and used the people and land to their own benefit. Learners can also demonstrate that they understand why the Spanish moved onto Central America, namely Mexico.

#### **Advanced activity**:

Learners can be given challenge questions to encourage thinking about other reasons for Spanish expansion e.g. why would Roman Catholic missionaries be attracted to the Caribbean?

## **Advanced outcome:**

Learners can explore other reasons for the Spanish conquest e.g. religion.

#### **Cross-curricular Skills – Digital Competence**

There are many opportunities to include Digital Competence in GCSE History. Learners can make use of digital technology to access a broad range of historical sources and to undertake research of a historical topic. Learners will also have the opportunity to develop their digital skills in preparing and completing their non-examination assessments. These opportunities will allow learners to develop crosscurricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the curriculum, as well as allowing further access to historical information while fostering current and future critical thinking and ethical awareness.

Below are some examples of how Digital Competence can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

|  | Learners will develop an understanding of the importance of attributions, including the use of resources in digital formats such as e-books and online articles. Learners will be required to address attributions when analysing items for their historical enquiry and to think critically about the authors of digital evidence. |  |
