Cross-curricular Skills – Numeracy

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in
primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These
opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidence-
based conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry
helps us understand
shape, space and position
and learning about
measurement helps us
quantify in the real world

Learning that statistics
represent data and that
probability models chance
help us make informed
inferences and decisions

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of
empires or the geographical representation of wars.

Examples

•  Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
•  Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
