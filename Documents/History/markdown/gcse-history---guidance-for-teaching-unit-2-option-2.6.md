#### **Cross-curricular Skills - Literacy**

There are many opportunities to include Literacy in GCSE History. These opportunities include the analysis of source material, extended writing opportunities, vocabulary development, debating and discussion. These opportunities are important to learners because they will develop cross-curricular skills which underpin the four purposes of the Curriculum for Wales, as well as communication skills which can be used across subjects and prepare them for future education or employment.

| Below are some examples of how Literacy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |  |

#### **Cross-curricular Skills - Numeracy**

There are many opportunities to include Numeracy in GCSE History, for example analysing population change, interpreting statistics in primary and secondary sources, analysing graphs and timelines and engaging with concepts such as chronological awareness. These opportunities are important to learners because it allows them to contextualise events and quantify change. Learners can draw evidencebased conclusions based on statistics and numerical data.

Below are some examples of how Numeracy can be embedded into teaching and learning for GCSE History.

Learning about geometry helps us understand shape, space and position and learning about measurement helps us quantify in the real world

Learners will have opportunities to analyse maps in order to understand the growth and development of empires or the geographical representation of wars.

#### **Examples**

- Learners can analyse maps, structures and artifacts.
- Learners can then analyse land division and urban planning.
- There are opportunities to analyse military strategies and fortifications.

Learning that statistics represent data and that probability models chance help us make informed inferences and decisions

Learners will have the opportunities to examine or interpret data and graphs through source analysis.

#### **Examples**

- Learners can analyse data to draw conclusions on statistics such as population growth, costs and land expansion.
