Overview of Unit 1

Devising Theatre

Practical non-examination assessment and Reflective Log
Marked by centre and moderated by WJEC.
40% of qualification
96 marks

The purpose of this unit is to:
•  develop an awareness and understanding of a range of theatrical

practitioners/companies/styles and genres

•  develop learners’ awareness and skills regarding the creation and development of their

own work

•  develop learners’ application of performance or design skills within a live performance
•  provide an opportunity for learners to develop their ability to reflect, analyse and evaluate

their creative decisions

•  develop learners’ resilience, determination and confidence.

This unit will focus on:
•  exploring – learners will have the opportunity to explore a range of theatrical

practitioners/companies/styles and genres. This will include a range of techniques,
forms, styles, contexts and means of presenting drama. Exploration could also be
through the means of live and/or digital theatre, as possible sources of influence for
performance or design ideas. Learners should have the opportunity to explore diversity,
including different perspectives, identity, culture, and contributions that span Wales and
the world.
responding and reflecting – learners will be able to reflect on their own work and
respond to the feedback from others as an on-going process throughout the
development period, allowing them to improve in the performances they give or in the
designs they create

•

•  creating – learners will contribute to the creation of a devised performance in response

to a choice of stimuli set by WJEC.

Learners may choose to complete this unit as actors or designers, regardless of their
chosen pathway in Unit 2.
Learners choosing design must choose one of the following options:
•
lighting design
•  sound design
•  set and props design
•  costume, hair and make-up design.

For this assessment learners are required to:
•  create and develop a piece of theatre in response to a stimulus, using either the

techniques of an influential theatre practitioner, company or the characteristics of a
theatrical style or genre and demonstrate and apply their performance or design skills in
a live performance

•  produce a reflective log.

Learners can choose to be assessed on either acting or design.

Learners can work in groups of between two and five actors. Each group may have up to
four designers, each offering a different design skill.

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

The length of this piece of theatre will depend on the number of actors in the group and
should be as follows:
•  Group of two actors:
5-10 minutes
•  Group of three actors:  7-12 minutes
9-14 minutes
•  Group of four actors:
11-16 minutes.
•  Group of five actors:

Each actor must interact with other actors and/or the audience for a minimum of five
minutes. The number of designers in a group does not impact on the length of the piece.
Learners may complete the assessment anytime during the course. However, centres should ensure
that assessment is completed only when learners have undertaken the necessary teaching and
learning and developed the required skills and knowledge.

The assessment contributes to 40% of the overall qualification. The unit will be marked out of total of
96 marks.
The stimuli will be released on WJEC’s portal during the September of the first year of study.
This unit will be assessed by the centre and externally moderated by WJEC.

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

1.1.1
Creating and
developing
ideas to
communicate
meaning

Learners should be able to:
•

(following exploration of a range of
relevant
practitioners/companies/styles/genres)
create and develop ideas to
communicate meaning within a devised
performance.

Learners are required to:

•  devise a performance in response to a
stimulus set by WJEC demonstrating
either the techniques of a theatre
practitioner/theatre company or the
dramatic conventions of a specific
theatrical style or genre.

Approaching Unit 1:
•  Devising theatre gives learners the opportunity to use their imagination, explore and

•

push their creativity and create something unique that they should feel shared
ownership of.
It can also be intimidating, frustrating and exposing. Devising theatre pushes learners
into uncharted territory and presents them with obstacles, dead ends and risk taking.
It requires teamwork, negotiation and taking responsibility. The devising process both
requires and develops a significant range of skills; subject-specific, personal and
interpersonal.

•  Because most learners may not have had much experience of drama or performance
before their GCSE course, they need a toolkit of techniques and knowledge and
range of practical experiences to give them some reference points for their Unit 1
devising project.
It is extremely important that learners are given the opportunity to explore a broad
range of drama in their Unit 1 preparation. The first year of a two-year GCSE course
offers the opportunity for learners to experience a diverse selection of styles,
practitioners, companies and genres from which they can then select their influence
for their Unit 1 project.

•

•  Using the first year of the course to build the devising skills, techniques and styles is

also a significant way of allowing learners to develop self-confidence through
experience. In this way the learners can be allowed to become progressively more
independent in their decision making and creativity, with the teacher guiding them to
facilitate their ambition, encouraging resourcefulness and resilience. Additionally, this
progressive independence allows them to amass a range of work-related skills and
experiences.

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

Important reminders (from assessment pack):
•  There is no restriction on the amount of time learners spend on exploring, creating

and developing their devised performance.

•  Once the creating and developing work is underway, feedback must be limited to
general advice on what needs to be improved. Teachers must not provide specific
guidance on how to achieve these improvements.

•  Teachers must see learners’ ideas in progress at least three times at different stages
during the process to be able to authenticate the work as the learner's own and
complete the necessary authentication documentation.

•  Teachers may provide guidance and support to learners to ensure that they have a
clear understanding of the requirements, including the stimuli, the reflective log and
the assessment grid.

Preparing for Unit 1.
Introduction to devising – building confidence and skills:
•  Learners need to feel confident at risk-taking and need to feel comfortable to be able
to develop ideas creatively through improvisation and collaborative experimentation.

•  The value of building whole-group relationships and group trust in the early stages of
the course cannot be underestimated. It is also worth considering gradually pushing
learners out of their comfort zone through a series of confidence-developing
workshops and activities as a prelude to the devising process.

•  The table below contains some suggestions for areas that might be covered to
prepare for the Unit 1 task. These are ideas only and are not a prescribed or
exhaustive list.

Developing self
confidence in voice

Ideas for activities

A series of teacher-led voice workshops, exploring
different aspects of voice, for example:
•  volume
•
tone
•  pitch
•  pace
•  silence and pause
•  nonsense conversations
•  sound making
•  soundscapes
•  humming and singing.

Developing self
confidence in physicality

A series of teacher-led workshops, exploring different
aspects of physicality, for example:

freezeframes

levels of tension

•
•  blooming and withering
•
•  adding animal characteristics to walking
•  exaggeration
•  slow motion 70’s disco moves with eyes closed to

avoid embarrassment

•  centring
•  mime
•  simplified Laban’s efforts focussing on direction,
(direct/indirect); weight (heavy/light); speed
(quick/sustained) and flow (bound/free)

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

trust and balance exercises

•
•  simple lifts
•  simple contact work.

At this point, learners could have the option to perform
to the class, another pair, the teacher only, depending
on their confidence. Resilience and confidence can be
developed by increasing the perceived level of risk (the
size and composition of the audience) over a series of
mini performance opportunities.

•  Pair tasks – two cats chatting at the vet’s
•  Small group task – each person is a component of a

•

machine that makes a final product with movement
and sound.
Individual task – a devised monologue, for example,
focussing on voice about “things that annoy me”.  A
physical piece with voice – for example, a washing
machine talking about its life as it works.

Introduction to devising theatre:
•  Learners need to understand what devising is and need to experience a range of

devising strategies so that they can develop an understanding of a process to follow
when they create their own pieces. All learners should be given the opportunity to
experience a range of roles including actor, designer and director as they explore
theatre. This will help them better consider each other’s roles in the final project.

•  They should have opportunities to learn about the reflective log and practice collating

material and reflecting on their process and performance work through analysis and
evaluation.

•  To augment this, the more performance material learners can see, the better. It is

important for learners to have experienced a range of material in different styles and
forms so that they have a set of reference points they can use to inspire their own

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

work and so that they can develop their understanding of how theatrical performance
and design communicate meaning to an audience.

•  Setting learners a series of mini projects where learners are taught about a style or

practitioner and then work practically with that practitioner or style to produce a short
workshop performance will give them a range of experiences and reference points
that they can draw on for the three units in the GCSE course.

•  Actors and designers can plan and present their ideas and should be given

opportunities to show their work in a performance or workshop performance context.

•

It is important that learners understand what devising is, but more importantly have
several tools and strategies to draw on when they work. Below are some links that
might be useful to help develop some strategies for learners to use:

Ideas for exploring how to approach a stimulus – teaching ideas:
•  For examples of stimuli, please see the accompanying Assessment Pack (Page 7)

Portal by WJEC

Possible task

•  Learners could be presented with a variety of different stimuli (quotation, song,
statement, painting, photograph, object etc) as part of a carousel set up in the
studio or classroom. These stimuli could be selected to subtly elicit connections
with some cross-cutting themes for example, sustainability, human rights and
diversity, relationships and sexuality, local, national or international contexts.
In a small group or pairs, spend 10 minutes with each stimulus and need to
answer the following questions:

•

•  Where, when, who, what (is happening/has happened), why?
•  Answers need to contain detail for example, “in North Wales” is not enough for

“where?”. Something more like, “outside the Bangor Road Co-op in
Penmaenmawr,” would be much more specific and will open up many more
possibilities.
In a plenary, groups can be asked for their responses. The teacher could push
for more in-depth answers and pursue a learner’s idea to model how it could be
developed.

Developing their idea more:

Possible task

1.  List themes or issues that their ideas have raised for their favourite storyline
2.  Use one or two of these themes develop the idea further
3.  Consider the characters in the idea
4.  Use a simple chart using adjectives to help define the characters. Learners

should aim to choose adjectives that describe the personality of their characters

•  What is devising?
•  Working with a stimulus (see above).
•  The devising process.

•  A series of sessions that give learners an

overview of set and props, lighting, sound and
costume hair and make-up.

•  These might include watching performance

what sort of meaning they can convey and how.
•  Using realia such as lanterns, costumes, props,
make-up will help make these sessions more
interactive.

•
Introduce and workshop naturalism.

practitioner or style.
•  Rehearsal process.

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

•  Session on how to turn rehearsal notebook
content into reflective log analysis and
evaluation.

•  Using notes to write analysis and evaluation of

their work during the process.

•  Videoed performance with audience

questionnaires.

•  Groups can discuss their videoed work, with an
end objective of helping each other identify
content for their reflective logs.

•  Written analysis and evaluation of their own

work in the performance.

Group mini-project 3:
Working with another
style, practitioner, genre or
theatre company

•  Learners work with more autonomy, practising
some of the processes they have explored
earlier, leading up to a performance of their
work.

•  Learners could produce another Reflective log,
or sections of the log. Alternatively, different
sections of the log could be spaced out over
mini-projects 2 and 3.

Creating the final exam piece:
•  Essentially the task consists of five stages - development of ideas, building the piece,

refining the piece, performing and reflecting on the process and performance.

Grouping learners:
•  Careful consideration should be given to grouping learners for Unit 1. Some centres
will decide the groups, others may discuss learner’s preferences for a particular style
or practitioner to help with grouping decisions. Some learners might welcome the
opportunity to be able to nominate two other learners that they might like to work
with, and to rank their stylistic preferences. Ultimately, the teacher knows their class
best and will make the final call.

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

Design candidates:
•  The design options available to learners will be influenced by the centre’s ability to

resource the learners choosing either set and props, lighting, sound or costume, hair
and make-up design. It is important that design candidates experience the same
depth and range of experiences as acting candidates. They are an integral part of the
Unit 1 group and should work closely with the actors in planning, developing and
refining their designs as the piece evolves. Elements of design ideally will begin to be
used and experimented with by the groups as the work develops; costume
measurements, hair and make-up try-outs early will inform refinement decisions, as
will experiments with set and props during rehearsals. Lighting designers might need
to adapt the intensity or positioning of lanterns as changes are made by the actors;
sound designers need to experiment with sound choices, volumes and placing their
sound in conjunction with the actors.

•

It is important to try to ensure that designers avoid a highly pressured final week; this
can easily occur if the performers keep making modifications and alterations beyond
a cut-off. This needs to be a point, agreed in advance, after which the changes
should not be allowed to alter the design work significantly.

There are minimum requirements for the realisation of each design option:
Lighting design:
•  6 different states
•
•  cue sheets.

learners must operate the lighting board in the performance

Sound design:
•  6 different cues
•
•  cue sheets.

learners must operate the sound desk in the performance

16

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

Set design and props design:
•  set and props created and/or dressed for performance of 1 group
•

learners must arrange the props table/set up performance space prior to the
performance and provide a model set. The model may be presented in a digital
format.

Costume design, hair and make-up design:
•  1 full costume, hair and make-up for 2 different characters (two costume, hair and

make-up designs in total)

•  sketches of both costume, hair and make-up designs.

Group sizes:
•  Each centre should consider its own context and learners when deciding on group
sizes. The final performances should aim to be within the timing range stipulated.
Teachers should consider how effectively their learners will be able to sustain
performance in larger groups producing longer pieces.

•  There can be between 2 and 5 actors in a performance group. Each performance

group can have up to 4 designers, with each designer offering a different design skill.

Timings
•  Group of two actors: 5-10 minutes
•  Group of three actors: 7-12 minutes
•  Group of four actors: 9-14 minutes
•  Group of five actors: 11-16 minutes.

•  The number of designers does not affect the performance timings. For example, a

performance by a group with two actors and four designers should last between 5-10
minutes.

•  Each actor must interact with other actors and/or the audience for a minimum of five

minutes.

Selecting the stimulus:

© WJEC CBAC Ltd.2025

17

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

•  Learners should be given the opportunity to explore each of the stimuli. It might be
useful to give learners a handout with all the stimuli as well as printed song lyrics (if
there is a song in the stimuli) that they can read while the song is played This might
mean one lesson is allocated to each stimulus.

•  This is productive as it not only gives learners the opportunity to explore the range of
stimuli, but it also generates discussion and ideas which may be returned to even if a
different stimulus is chosen.

•  Using notes from their exploration of different styles, practitioners, genres and

companies carried out earlier in the course, learners might find it useful to create a
checklist of key features and devices that they consider using in their work. This will
help them to ensure that their work contains a variety of techniques, conventions and
devices appropriate to their chosen practitioner, style, company or genre.

Selecting style, practitioner, genre or company:
•

It is preferable if learners can input into this selection themselves, with some
guidance, basing their preference on what they have learned or experienced over the
course, where they feel their strengths lie and the individuals within the group.

Considerations when selecting the influence:
•  The performance and design needs to clearly recognisable features of the chosen
practitioner, company, style or genre. Centres should explore a range of these in
adequate detail to give learners enough information and experience to be able to
knowledgeably create work that effectively demonstrates their choice of working
method.

•  Design candidates do not have to be tied to the same choice as the acting

candidates. For example, a devised piece might have actors working in a naturalistic
style with naturalistic costuming, but the set and prop design could be symbolic or
expressionistic if it worked effectively within the concept of the piece. It is anticipated
that learners would go on to analyse and evaluate their artistic decision regarding this
stylistic choice within the reflective log.

•  Practitioners, styles, genres and theatre companies should be recognised and

known. The theatre company does not need to be currently operating. If you have
any concerns about the suitability of a practitioner, company, style or genre, please
contact WJEC before committing.

There are, of course, many available practitioners and styles that centres could choose
to work with. Within the GCSE Drama Delivery Guide (Appendix A), teachers will find a
list of Theatre Practitioners and Genres which can be used to develop learner’s work.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd.2025

23

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

Other styles and practitioners that centres could consider might include:
•  Theatre of Cruelty
•  Artaud
•  Total Theatre
•  Steven Berkoff
•  Theatre of the Oppressed
•  Augusto Boal
•  Kitchen Sink Drama
•  Verbatim
•  Emma Rice
•  Katie Mitchell.

Styles designers might consider:
•  Naturalistic
•  Non-naturalistic
•  Epic/Brechtian
•  Expressionistic
•  Minimalistic
•  Symbolic
•  Realism.

Genres:
Learners might choose to work with a genre. Often, combining a genre with a style or
practitioner will help add structure and form to the devised work.
Possible choices might include:
•  Comedy
•  Tragedy
•  Tragicomedy
•  Farce
•  Melodrama
•  Satire.

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

Theatre Companies:
•  Modern theatre mixes styles and techniques, and most theatre companies have their
own “house style”. It is often difficult to categorise theatre companies by style or
practitioner because of this merging of influences.

•  Devising a piece in the style of a theatre company can be exciting and highly

rewarding; centres are reminded of the importance of ensuring that learners have an
adequate understanding of the company and its work.

•  The devised pieces need to clearly use features of the company’s style and
approach, which will need to be analysed and evaluated in the reflective log.

•  Some suggestions for companies follow. A number of the companies work with a
clearly recognisable practitioner or style; the work of others is more hybrid.
•  These are just some ideas, and by no means should be seen as a prescriptive or

exclusive list.

Devising task:
•

It might be helpful to task learners with compiling a list of “ingredients” that might be
expected in a devised piece that works within the conventions or techniques of a
particular genre, style, company or practitioner if it is not in the table above. This will
give them a useful checklist for their devising and will also enable the teacher to
check that the learners understand what needs to be evident in their work.

Maintaining momentum:
•  Centres may choose to incorporate several interim deadlines in their devising
process. These might set a date for the formal end of research and ideas
development; a date by when a complete “rough draft” of the work is to be finished
and a date by when the refinement period should be complete. Incorporated into this
schedule, it might be useful to include a number of short workshop performances or
showings of the work.

•  A questionnaire for the audience will assist refinement of the piece. Designers should
aim to include elements of their design work in these showcases. These deadlines
will help learners and teachers avoid feeling highly pressured towards the end of the
process as the performance date nears.

Rehearsal notes:
•  Keeping notes from rehearsals that are focussed on key areas relevant to the

reflective log will allow learners to collate information as their work progresses. The
can then select key information from their notes for their reflective log at the end of
the process.

•  These notes could include, for example, a brief summary of a technique used, how,
why and how it was successful. The notebook is the ideal place for learners to cite
their research sources, include mind maps, sketches, script extracts. Ultimately, the
notebook will provide much of the content of the Reflective Log. The centre might opt
to design a pre-formatted booklet or online document that learners can use.

•  Along with this, or alternatively, centres may include reflective log writing sessions

along with their interim deadlines, allowing learners to produce the log as an ongoing
document.

Developing
and applying
performance
or design
skills within a
live
performance

Learners are required to:
•  develop and apply their performance or

design skills within a live performance

Learners should be able to:
(performance)
•  demonstrate their ability to apply

performance skills in relation to their
chosen practitioner/company’s
theatrical aims or their chosen
style/genre’s conventions

•  communicate their interpretation of
character(s) and sustain audience
engagement

•  contribute to the performance

(designers)
•  demonstrate their ability to apply

design skills in relation to their chosen
practitioner/company’s theatrical aims
or their chosen style/genre’s
conventions, as relevant to their
chosen design option

•  communicate their interpretation of the

extract(s) and sustain audience
engagement

•  ensure their design contributes to the

performance.

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

Performing:
•

It is ideal if the exam itself has a sense of occasion and an audience. Hopefully the
learners will be well-rehearsed, confident in their work and in themselves. The
audience might be a small number of people invited by the performers, their own
class or the drama class from the year below.

•

If TIE is chosen as a style, a primary class or year 7 group may be the audience.
Some centres may also wish to get their learners to perform their work to a wider
audience a short time before their real exam. This can be very useful as it provides a
genuine performance environment for the learners and may make them feel more
confident and in control of their examination performance, although not all candidates
may want to show their work to their family or parents and centres should consider
the extra pressure that this may place on their learners.

General guidelines to aid the exam:
•  The performances must be recorded, stored and uploaded for moderation.

•  The camera should be set up on a tripod providing a clear view of the whole stage. It
should be positioned close enough to allow the details of the performance to be
clearly seen by the moderator. Test the camera before the performance to ensure
everything is working properly, especially the sound and the focus.

•

If a group has opted to use a promenade staging, then it is perfectly acceptable for
the camera to follow the work, however, please be mindful that the work will be
required for moderation and will need to clearly justify the marks awarded by the
centre.

•  Each group’s introduction and performance should be recorded as one continuous
take. It is useful to get learners to rehearse their introductions during the rehearsal
process, and it is perfectly reasonable to let them use a prompt card with their
information written on it to avoid the introduction turning into the most stressful part of
the exam.

•

If during the performance, candidates forget lines and there is a pause, this must not

30

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

be edited out.

•  To ensure consistency for all groups and to aid the smooth filming of the exam, it

might be useful after the introduction for the teacher to ask the group to get to their
starting positions, call for a blackout when they are ready and count down “3,2,1” to
start the performance and set the timer running.

Using the recording for the Reflective log:
•  Learners need to watch back their performances as soon after the exam as possible.

Centres should consider how this might be facilitated. Learners might be given
access to watch the recording by group once it has been placed on the centre’s
system; alternatively, if a centre’s policy permits, learners might ask a member of the
audience to film their group’s performance which can then be shared with the group
quickly. Obviously, centres need to consider that this is exam work and must only be
seen and used by the individual learners for the purpose of their logs and should not
be shared publicly under any circumstances.

Blackouts, scene changes and timing:
•  Over-long blackouts should be avoided and should not count towards the overall

running time of the performance. What happens in the blackout should be rehearsed
thoroughly as part of the preparation process to identify issues and ensure that
transitions in blackout can be smooth and efficient.

•

If a detailed set change is required, it may not be practical to do this in complete
darkness; in this case it is perfectly acceptable for the scene to end with a blackout,
then a dim working light (blue flood) can fade up to allow the set designer to alter the
set as required. Working lights will fade out and the next scene will commence.

•  A costume designer might need to alter a costume on a character or change their
makeup, or a lighting designer might need to change a gel in a sidelight mid
performance. Again, it is perfectly acceptable for this to happen under working lights
to allow the design to be realised effectively.

•  However, the timer should be paused for this to take place and restarted when the

performance continues.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd.2025

31

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

Design candidates:
•  Design candidates need to be present. They should introduce themselves at the start
of the performance along with the acting candidates, including their name, candidate
number and design option.

•  Sound and lighting candidates must operate the sound or lighting boards in the

performance.

•  As stated above, they can alter or adapt their design work , as appropriate, during the

performance.

Unforeseen circumstances:
•  Hopefully the exam will be an exciting and rewarding day and a celebration of lots of
hard work. However, sometimes unforeseen circumstances occur that interrupt the
performance, such as a fire alarm. If this happens, the performance needs to stop.

•

It is important to make sure that all learners have the same fair and equal experience
on exam day. When the interruption has passed, the affected group should
recommence their performance from the point where it was interrupted, and filming
should restart at that point.

•  When submitting the video for moderation, it would comprise two parts.
•

It would not be appropriate to let one group restart and have a second run when all
the other groups did not have this option.  In the event of any such unforeseen
circumstances, please notify WJEC.

•

Important points for consideration include individual performance time and work that
is significantly under-length.

•  Of course, within a performance, actors might exit and then re-enter for a different
scene; some actors may not be present in all scenes. On the other hand, some
performances might be ensemble work with all performers interacting together for a
sustained period.

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

•

•

•

In order to access all mark bands, each actor should be interacting in the space for a
minimum of five minutes.

In situations where a learner is interacting for fewer than 5 minutes, careful
consideration should be given to where the candidate’s marks are placed. If a
candidate is significantly below the 5-minute threshold, for example, they are
performing for two minutes or less, the marks awarded are likely to be in the lower
bands.

If a group performance is within the timing range, it does not automatically follow that
all performers are able to access all mark bands. For example, if one actor is only on
stage and interacting for 2 minutes, then this must be considered when assessing the
learners.

Examples of timing scenarios:

Work that is longer than the maximum time limit:
•  Teachers should remind groups that their work has a maximum time limit. During the
development and rehearsal of the work, learners should be encouraged to time their
pieces, and during the refinement process, the work needs to be trimmed to length if
it risks being over-long.

•  There is no penalty for work that exceeds the time limit, however, only work up to the

maximum time should be assessed. Moderators will not look at work after the
maximum time has been reached and consequently only work up to the maximum
time will be taken into consideration during moderation.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd.2025

34

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

•  The timings are designed to allow the process to be manageable for centres and
accessible to learners. Rather than striving to create long pieces, learners might
consider as an alternative adding depth and refining their work through further
detailed application of practitioner or stylistic features.

•  Particularly with naturalistic styled work, ideas with very complex plotlines can be
difficult to realise successfully within a short performance time. Learners could
consider whether focussing in on a particular moment or relationship within a
complex plot line might allow for more detailed characterisation and more sustained
interaction for their devised performance.

The performance needs to allow learners to:
(actors)
•  demonstrate their ability to apply performance skills in relation to their chosen

practitioner/company’s theatrical aims or their chosen style/genre’s conventions
•  communicate their interpretation of character(s) and sustain audience engagement
•  contribute to the performance.

(designers)
•  demonstrate their ability to apply design skills in relation to their chosen

practitioner/company’s theatrical aims or their chosen style/genre’s conventions, as
relevant to their chosen design option

•  communicate their interpretation of the extract(s) and sustain audience engagement
•  ensure their design contributes to the performance.

work

Learners should be able to:
•

reflect on, analyse and evaluate their
own work

•  critically evaluate the effectiveness and
impact of their creative choices linked
to their:
•
•  choice of

response to their chosen stimulus

practitioner/company/style/genre

•  application of performance or

design skills.

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

The Reflective Log
•  The reflective log gives learners the opportunity to analyse and evaluate their work in

both the process and the final performance of UNIT1. There is no prescribed format
for the reflective log, allowing learners to present their information in a format that
best suits them as individuals.

•

It is important to consider the manageability of the format chosen to ensure that
learners can communicate effectively through their chosen format and that the
technological requirements of the format can be met. This is particularly pertinent to
formats using video.

•  Centres should be mindful of the requirement to upload the reflective logs for

moderation and should be satisfied that this can be achieved as efficiently and
smoothly as possible from the centre’s perspective, to avoid taking up unnecessarily
large amounts of time.

•  Design candidates must, in their log, include evidence of their final design, as

appropriate to their chosen skill, which could include the following: WJEC Drama
Specification.

Lighting design:
•  cue sheets
•
lighting plot
•  mood board

Sound design:
•  cue sheets
•  sound plot
•  mood board

Set and props design:
•  set model
•  ground plan
•  photographs of set and props tables

38

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

final design sketches

Costume, hair and make-up design:
•
•  photographs of the designs in performance (could be taken during dress rehearsals)
•  mood board.
Possible formats might include (this is not an exhaustive list):
•  A typed or written document. This may include appendices and/or illustrative

material.

•  A PowerPoint (or similar) presentation with either audio or a transcript
•  A filmed PowerPoint (or similar) presentation.
•  An audio recording
•  A video talk to camera
•  A series of vlogs of key moments with a voiceover/commentary
•  An audio or video in an interview format

•

It is important to ensure that the format or formats chosen for the creative log will be
manageable in terms of time, resources and logistics. Centres might wish to
consider:

How detailed might the log need to be?
•  Every learner will find a different level of challenge in producing the reflective log and

therefore centres need to consider their own specific contexts and learners.
Essentially, the log asks for learners to reflect on three areas through analysis and
evaluation.

For acting candidates:
•  why the stimulus was chosen and how it influenced the final performance.
•  how the chosen practitioner/company’s artistic aims or the chosen style/genre’s

performance conventions were incorporated into their final performance.

•  how the learner’s own performance skills contributed to the effectiveness of the final

performance.

For design candidates:
•  why the stimulus was chosen and how it influenced the final design.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd.2025

39

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

•  how their chosen practitioner/company’s artistic aims or their chosen style/genre’s

design conventions were incorporated into the final design.

•  how their own design skills contributed to the effectiveness of the final performance.
•  During a learner’s reflection, they are invited to talk about what they did, how, why

and why it was successful (or not).

•  When assessing the log, it is important not to equate the number of points made with

marks, but to use the mark scheme to assess the log holistically and place the work
in the appropriate band.

•  Teachers and learners should consider the following:

•

is the log as a whole: detailed; competent; basic; limited; or does it contain no
analysis or evaluation?

•  Are all the three areas covered?
•

Is there a range of examples and how detailed is the level of analysis and
evaluation?

•  A detailed log might cover breadth and depth very effectively, reflecting on each of
the three areas with a number of examples and detailed analysis and evaluation, or
may identify a smaller number of examples but with very detailed analysis and
evaluation.

•  A basic log might cover all three areas with some examples and some basic analysis

and evaluation. There may be unequal level of detail across the three areas.

Length of Reflective Log
•  Video or audio – there is no specific guidance given as to the length of this, but in

order to ensure all aspects are considered, it would likely be within the 3 – 7 minutes
window.

•  Written – there is no specific guidance given as to the length of this, but it would likely

be fewer than 800 words.

•  Consideration should be given to how much lesson time is allocated to the reflective

log. For example, will learners be given guidance and advice in class and be
expected to produce the log independently or will time be allocated to producing the

© WJEC CBAC Ltd.2025

40

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

log in lesson time.

When to produce the reflective log.
•

It is good practice to make sure that learners know what the reflective log is and what
it needs to contain before they begin the devising project. As the work develops, they
could be given opportunities to pause and to reflect on their progress, skills and
techniques used. These reflective moments will provide content for the final log.

•  Centres may decide that learners will produce sections of the log as they go;

alternatively, some centres may decide that learners will collate material during the
process, and, after the performance will be able to select material, they wish to
include in their final log.

•  When, how and where the video or audio logs are recorded should be carefully

considered. Learners may have access to a separate space for recording during a
lesson or, it might be appropriate to organise lunchtime or after school recordings.

Considerations for possible Reflective Log formats:
•  A typed or written document. This may include appendices and/or illustrative

material.

•  This document could be typed or hand-written. It could be divided into sub-headed
sections. It might contain illustrative material, perhaps photos of rehearsal and/or
performance, extracts of the devising script showing modifications over time, design
sketches and/or photos; extracts from research; links, websites and citations.
It is important that the document contains clear analysis and evaluation which should
be overt rather than implicit. For example, consideration should be given as to
whether a series of images of rehearsal demonstrates analysis and evaluation, or
whether it simply documents the process.

•

A PowerPoint (or similar) presentation with either audio or a transcript
•

If learners choose to use presentation applications, e.g. PowerPoint, it is important to
consider the need for the presentation to contain clear analysis and evaluation. For
moderation purposes a simple PowerPoint (or prints of slides) may not contain
sufficient analysis and evaluation without a transcript of the presentation given. The
PowerPoint could be voiced.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd.2025

41

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

A filmed PowerPoint (or similar) presentation.
•

If this format is used, centres should be mindful of the need to ensure that the video

choose to upload the PowerPoint along with the video of the learner.

An audio recording
•  This could take the form of a recorded speech. Alternatively, candidates might
choose to compile a series of short recordings during the process and after the
performance. It is important that these audio recordings contain analysis and
evaluation. Some learners might want to record on their phones or devices; centres
will need to consider whether this is acceptable or appropriate within their own
contexts. It is important to consider how these recordings are stored, whether there is
a risk of them being deleted and how they will be uploaded/transferred.

A video talk to camera
•  This might be in the form of a learner talking directly to camera. The style may be

formal or relatively informal but appropriate for the task and audience. Learners may
use supporting materials for example they could read short extracts of script or play
brief extracts of their performance on a laptop or phone to the camera.

•  Some learners may want to edit their talk and use video effects; the manageability of
the format should be considered, and teachers and learners should be mindful of how
much time might be taken for this process. Some learners might want to record on
their phones or devices; centres will need to consider whether this is acceptable or
appropriate within their own contexts. It is important to consider how these recordings
are stored, whether there is a risk of them being deleted and how they will be

A series of vlogs of key moments with a voiceover/commentary
•  Learners may choose to record a series of short videos or vlogs over the duration of
the devising project. It is important that these videos contain analysis and evaluation.
The style may be formal or relatively informal but appropriate for the task and
audience. Learners may use supporting materials for example they could read short
extracts of script or play brief extracts of their performance on a laptop or phone to

Authentication of the Reflective Log:
•  Teachers may provide guidance and support to learners to ensure that they have a
clear understanding of the requirements, including the stimuli, the reflective log and
the assessment grid.

•  Teachers must also see at least one draft of the reflective log but must not provide
any written feedback before the final submission. Feedback must be limited to
general advice and teachers must not provide specific guidance on how to improve
the work. The teacher must sign the authentication document to authenticate the
reflective log as the learner's own work.

Once the reflective log has been submitted to the teacher to assess, no further
amendments may be made. Please see accompanying Assessment pack for more
information. Portal by WJEC

•  Watching a range performance of work (in whole or in part)
when exploring different styles, practitioners, genres and
companies will give learners a better understanding of what
the style looks like and how technical elements might be used
within that particular style.

•  Using live streaming, theatre trips, workshops (online or live)
will provide learners with a wide range of references and
experiences that they can adapt, develop and use in their own
devising process and performance. It might be possible to
collaborate with another centre to organise a joint workshop
with a company or provider; theatre productions often have a q
and a session for a particular performance; touring companies
often offer workshops at a venue with discounted tickets and
workshop places; cultivating links with local professionals,
theatre companies or venues can open collaborative projects
and opportunities to broaden learners’ experiences of theatre
performance and design.

•  Developing self-confidence early in the course to encourage
learners to take risks with improvisation later. Setting a
minimum time length for improvising a scene or moment will
introduce more risk, but will generate more material,
overcoming creative challenges.

•  Giving each learner an opportunity to plan and deliver a short
rehearsal segment that sets out to explore one of their own
ideas using a selected practitioner technique will up the risk
but develop self-confidence and help move the work forward.

•  Encouraging learners to try out all ideas practically rather than
just discussing possibilities and accepting that not all of the try-
outs will work. This will help develop confidence as everyone
will have ownership of the practical development of the work,
and ideas that don’t work have been tried and explored.

•  Encouraging a “what if?” mentality and an appreciation that
originality requires risk taking; creating more moments than
they think they need will give a wider range of material to
develop and refine, with some material being cast aside. This
prompts creative resilience, and an understanding that the
process will involve ideas being rejected.

Opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales

Curriculum for Wales Strands

Cross-cutting Themes

There are many opportunities to include Local, National and International Contexts in GCSE
Drama. These opportunities are important to Learners because Drama challenges them to
consider their cynefin and the possibilities they have to shape and impact the world in which they
live. Through the diverse study of play texts and theatre craft, learners are invited to embrace their
own cultural heritage as a means of positively contributing to the society in which they live.

Below are some examples of how Local, National & International Contexts can be embedded into
teaching and learning:

•  Unit 1 provides plenty of opportunity to include this
strand. In their study and research of practitioners,
styles, genres and companies and in their ideas’
development of stimuli, learners will experience a
range of local, national and international perspectives
and views across a wide range of social, cultural and
historical contexts. Exploring the relationship between
their own views and locality and the views of other
individuals will help develop an understanding of
themselves as part of a global community.

Examples of how this might be approached:
•  A devising stimulus might develop and create a

physical theatre performance that explores conflict
between rural and urban communities. This may be
influenced by Eddie Ladd’s ‘Dawns Ysbrydion’ and
research into current or recent events explored

through research. The idea may be developed to
draw parallels between individuals’ experiences of
conflict in the local community in other countries.

•  A devised piece might adopt a verbatim style,

exploring the effect of the recent pandemic using
research from different countries and locations to
connect people through a shared experience.
Learners might use a naturalistic style or opt for a
physical style drawing on ideas in DV8’s ‘Can We
Talk About This’.

There are many opportunities to include Sustainability in GCSE Drama. These opportunities are
important to Learners because we as a world collective share this responsibility and in studying
these matters, learners are empowered to enact change for the better.

•  The stimuli provided facilitates a wide range of
possibilities for the inclusion of cross-cutting
themes exploration, including ideas that explore
sustainability. The devising process allows
learners to explore, discuss and articulate their
understanding concerns and frustrations with
environmental issues. Understanding that a
sustainable approach to theatre making and
performance is important will help learners make
decisions about a wide range if details within
their work, from using natural light in rehearsal
where possible to making sustainable choices
with their design ideas.

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

Examples of how this might be approached:
•  Learners could be given a practice devising task

to create and develop a TIE piece using a
stimulus related to sustainability.

•  All learners could opt for digital options when making

notes, planning, mind mapping their ideas.
•  Designers could work with more sustainable

approaches, for example set and props designers
could choose to repurpose, recycle and reuse in their
approach to their designs.

•  Costume, hair and make-up designers could consider
more sustainable sources for their costumes – charity
shops, eBay, repurpose, reuse, recycle, upcycle,
alterations, etc.

•  Lighting designers could consider and calculate the

energy consumption of lanterns, exploring alternative
innovative methods of lighting their work, for example,
mobile phones; led lanterns; led candles, etc. They
could then use their findings to influence their design
decisions.

•  The stimuli provided for Unit 1 facilitates a wide
range of possibilities for the inclusion of cross-
cutting theme exploration, including ideas that
explore RSE. The creative process in devising
allows learners to explore and reflect on
experiences in a safe and inclusive environment.
Research and learning about practitioners and
companies will give the opportunity for learners
to see how RSE themes and issues have been
influential or have been explored through
performance. Devising their own work allows the
opportunity to start to understand the world
through the eyes of someone else and create
empathy. The opportunity to analyse and
evaluate the success of their work in the
reflective log will contribute and develop their
idea of what matters to them.

•  A contemporary physical theatre devised piece, could
explore repressive attitudes towards sexuality. This
would enable learners to explore their own thoughts
and reactions in a safe environment, which allows
them to empathise with and consider different
viewpoints and experiences to their own and

exploring tensions in different contemporary families.

•  A TIE piece using ‘Arad Goch’ as an influencing
practitioner for new year 7’s could focus on the
challenges of relationships and friendships in the
transition to secondary school from primary school. It
might present a range of data, facts and experiences

facilitates discussion of differing views and
opinions and requires acceptance and an effort
to understand different points of view and beliefs.

•  Specific examples of human rights injustices or

prejudice and the rights of the individual, whether
local national or international can become
powerful influences in a performance that seeks
to highlight injustice and promote valuing
diversity. Reflecting on the work allows
consideration of how a message or perspective
was effectively communicated.

Examples of how this might be approached:
•  Learners might research information about
migration and refugees and explore linked
performance work that will influence a piece
about these refugees’ decisions to leave their
homes, for example:

to local, national and international contexts by
exploring how asylum seekers may be treated and
viewed by the local community, as well as watching
work by international practitioners as part of the

•  A stimulus of a row of boarded up houses could

generate a naturalistic devised piece that explores the
destruction of much of Cardiff’s Tiger Bay and the

In Unit 1, the exploration of a range of theatrical styles
and employing a range of diverse techniques and
conventions allows learners to have careers and
work-related experiences through their development
and assimilation of a range of work-related skills such
as taking risks, developing resilience and learning
from experience as well as employing creative skills.

•  Research and the development of narrative to

communicate meaning within designated groups,
creates space for learners to develop problem
solving, logical thinking and decision-making skills.
The realisation of acting and design in performance
requires learners to rehearse their performance,
developing resilience, persistence and focus.
Approaches to rehearsal include developing time-
management, planning and organising skills.

•  Additionally, exploration and experiencing a range of
different roles within the industry will give learners the
opportunity to begin to consider careers choices and
opportunities.

Examples of how this might be approached:
•  Learners in a devising group could be allocated

specific job roles for the duration of the project, giving

59

GCSE Drama Guidance for Teaching, Unit 1

them individual responsibilities and accountability, for
example, each person has a responsibility to
incorporate one practitioner technique into the drama.
Each rehearsal session might require them to
produce in advance a list of objectives for the
rehearsal, with each session having a five-minute
plenary to discuss its efficacy as a team.

•

In addition to learning about, for example, technical
skills or acting skills, learners could learn about or
research into job roles within theatre. Learners could
be given or create a brief job description, outlining
their role and responsibilities within the project. This
experience could be enhanced with a tour of a local
theatre, or a Q & A session with someone from the
industry.

•  Learners might consider health and safety guidance,
for example when creating work that involves levels
or hazards. Designers might audit their working
practice to identify health and safety hazards, e.g.,
working at height, slip/trip hazards; use of liquids on
stage; safe positioning of electrical
equipment/lanterns; use of safety chains; safety in
blackouts.

•  Unit 1 provides many opportunities for listening for both
gist and specific information. Learners will need to use
focussed listening when learning new information about
styles or practitioners; in group discussions they will
need to listen and critically respond to others’ ideas and
opinions; when watching performance or research
material they will need to be able to decipher context
and subtext; when watching rehearsal material they will
use listening skills to ascertain the effectiveness of their
work in progress and to identify and resolve details that
are not communicating effectively.

•  Designers will need to listen and respond to their actors’
suggestions to refine their work. Sound designers will
use this skill to evaluate and refine their ideas in
rehearsal and performance.

Examples of how this might be approached:
•  Watching or listening to an interview about a theatre

company and, as a group discussing and creating a list
of questions that the learner has, that would allow them
to develop their understanding through further research.

and evaluating whether the words spoken are
appropriate for context and character.

•  Watching a YouTube clip about a theatrical style then
listening to the group’s collaborative discussion and
selection of initial ideas and discussing the best ones
that would fit with a particular style.

•  A sound designer might listen specifically for the

ascertain volume levels for their cue sheet or could ask
their actors to listen to a selection of options for musical
underscoring a performance and justify a choice in

•  Actors and designers will need to read both text,
digital sources and media for gist and specific
information, identifying subtext and context through
inference and deduction. Learners will need to read
and evaluate their own and other’s notes, diagrams
or mind maps.

•  Additionally, learners will read performances for
meaning and information. Learners will need to
read aloud from scripts or texts and will need to
proof-read their reflective log content.

Examples of how this might be approached:
•  Learners could read through a handout with

information about a practitioner to identify stylistic
features and cross out any content that is

irrelevant, encouraging them to read for specific
information.

•  Learners could explore a variety of script extracts,

reading aloud in role, and identify suitable moments
for lighting and /or sound cues, developing the skill
of reading ahead whilst reading for a specific
purpose.

•  Reading audience feedback sheets could enable
learners to read for specific information about the
audience response to selected areas of their work
to inform their reflective logs.

•  Proof-reading their reflective logs, programmes,

advertising, scripts and cue sheets will develop and
hone close reading skills and emphasises the need
for an awareness of accuracy.

talk in group discussion, taking on different roles
and using a wide range of speaking skills for a
range of audiences. They will need to adapt their
register for different contexts and develop their
ability to articulate challenging ideas and concepts.

language, for example about stage positioning in
rehearsal. Designers and actors will develop the
skill to articulate abstract ideas and concepts. This
process also allows them to talk effectively about
what they have heard, read or seen.

•  Talking collaboratively within their groups and to

their peers when presenting work in progress and
during the final performance allows learners to
speak in a range of contexts and adapt language
appropriately.

Examples of how this might be approached:
•  Exploring a variety of accents and register during
their character creation for a naturalistic devised
piece.

•  Stepping out of the rehearsal to observe the scene
and giving feedback and direction to peers clearly
and effectively using subject-specific vocabulary.

•  Discussing as a group strengths and weaknesses
behind the selection of a particular idea and
providing a sustained line of thought to persuade
the group in a particular direction.

•  A sound designer explaining to the actors the

rationale behind a particular choice of sound or
canvassing their opinion on its success.

•  There are a multitude of opportunities for writing during

Unit 1, whether in note form, formally or informally, on
paper or digitally. Learners will use writing to explain and
clarify their ideas, take notes, create and refine scripts,
compile rehearsal diaries and analyse and evaluate their
work in their reflective log. Learners opting for a video
log will need to be able to create cue cards and prompts.

•  Brechtian work will need accurate placards and

PowerPoint projections. Contributions to shared online
documents, e.g. an evolving script will require learners
to add their own contributions effectively.

Examples of how this might be approached:
•  Taking notes during a group discussion and creating a
mind-map or summary to distribute to the group or add
to the group chat to summarise the key points of the
discussion.

•  Writing script accurately using appropriate forms and
conventions; composing speeches for characters
making appropriate linguistic and lexical choices to
ensure clear communication of character and emotion.

•  Planning and writing a variety of drafts for the sections
of the reflective log, refining the material through
considered reflection and addition of subject specific
vocabulary and a wider range of connectives to link their
ideas more effectively.

•  There are a number of opportunities for learners to
develop mathematical proficiency using a range of
symbols and units of measurement. Opportunities can
often be found in the design element of the devised work.
Groups that have no designer will still need to consider
measurements of shape, space, and position. Designers
will need to use measurements, scale, percentages,
angles, weight, size and shape in their work and will need
to use mathematical language to talk about their designs.

different weights of fabric for a particular garment,
calculating different costs per square metre and working
within a set budget. A garment might need to be altered

designers for example in the consideration of types of
staging and size of performance space or the positioning
of key set or props and the effect these will have on the
versatility or the performance space.

Examples of how this might be approached:
•  Lighting designers and other learners will need to

consider these elements planning their lighting angles
and lantern positioning; set designers or learners planning
their performance space will consider these elements as
part of their design process and when they design a
model box using scales, converting units and working with
ratios. A sound designer might need to measure the
length of a crossfade or changing the tempo of a sound
effect to fit a movement sequence designed by a
performer to fit within a certain number of steps.

•  A costume designer will use their understanding of shape,

space and positioning to plan their pattern cutting
process; a set designer making part of the set will need to
do the same marking out pieces of the design on
cardboard or plywood to maximise the use of the material.

contribute to Unit 1. Learners might use statistics to
inform the development of devised work and provide
content for performance. Collecting data to generate
statistics might be important when compiling and
interpreting results in a questionnaire for an audience at a
performance try-out.

Examples of how this might be approached:
•  Performers might compile a tension graph for their
naturalistic performance and use it to identify
opportunities for reducing tension to make the work less
intense for the audience.

•  A devising group might opt to compile, construct and

reflect over data in order to make informed inferences and

narrative and use of statistics. This may feature in specific
theatrical styles and genres such as Theatre in Education
or Theatre of the Oppressed.

•  Being a conscientious digital citizen will be an important
consideration for learners in the devising process. Using
digital material and resources judiciously and safely to
research and develop creative ideas is a key part of the
process. Being aware of online safety and etiquette would
be a consideration if learners were contacting a theatre
company or communicating with any outside sources.

•  Thinking about when to use digital technology and how it
can contribute positively to the project will be important
when working with styles that require visual elements to
augment the performance. Considering laws about
plagiarism and copyright and illegal downloading need to
be considered when selecting, for example, audio and
video material.

Examples of how this might be approached:
•  Learners may manage digital files and folders, both

independently and collaboratively, during the devising
process and sharing of resources - a group may use a

will need to work using appropriate digital etiquette.

•  Learners are able to plan their digital work during the

rehearsal process and search a variety of sources when
constructing narrative and exploring design concepts.
They could compile a list of sources in their rehearsal
diaries to use in their Reflective Logs.

•  Learners might explore using multimedia in their devised

work and would need to consider the benefits and
limitations of a range of digital tools for their purpose
which might feature in their reflective log.

•  Presentation of digital material at the end of the process

when realising acting and design in performance,
facilitates the refinement of digital work based on
reflection. This is also true of the Reflective Log if
constructed digitally.

Interacting and collaborating digitally will play a role in
Unit 1. Learners will share ideas digitally using a variety of
devices and apps. Identifying the most effective method
of digital communication will help move the work forward.
Learners can interact digitally to meet virtually, to plan
and discuss and might also create a collaborative location
for storing ongoing video, photos and drafts of work. They
may use a variety of communication providers and should
be mindful of the limitations and etiquette of these. It is
very important that learners are aware of privacy settings
and how to ensure that their work remains private for the
group.

Interacting and

•  A performance group might set up a shared OneDrive

document with permissions for all group members to be
able to add and edit material with for a group script with
multiple users collaborating simultaneously.

•  A devising group of actors with designers might use

Pinterest as an online collaborative mood board as they
research and develop their idea.

•  The process of creating and refining in Unit 1 offers

numerous opportunities for learners to be curious and
inquisitive regarding a range of dramatic stimuli, theatrical
forms and conventions as well as drama theory and
historical context. The devising process also enables
learners to be open to different ways of thinking, consider
influences and develop knowledge to shape their own
creativity.

•  Furthermore, the creation and refining of material requires
learners to demonstrate effective generation of ideas. The
process of creating material from ‘page to stage’ allows
learners to link and connect disparate experiences,
knowledge and skills, and explore and justify alternative
solutions where acting and design concepts may not work
in practice.

Examples of how this might be approached:
•  Trying a series of creative experiments with lanterns to try
to create the effect of a car’s headlights coming onto

•  Performing theatre requires a range of combined skills
including planning, shaping and editing. Effective
performances require learners to develop and demonstrate
control of a range of skills and an application of
knowledge. The development of the pieces for final
performance, using amendment and refinement skills,
lends itself to critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
Overcoming problems encountered in the rehearsal period
will require learners to demonstrate critical thinking and
problem-solving skills.

Examples of how this might be approached:
•  Creating and developing effective transitions to link

disjointed key scenes would encourage individual and
group problem-solving skills.

•

Identifying why a particular sound effect does not combine
effectively with a particular moment in a piece of theatre
would require sophisticated critical thinking and problem-

UNIT1 which helps learners to become enterprising,
resourceful and resilient, to work as a team and be reliable
contributors. Through research and communication of
meaning, they are able to develop an understanding of the
world around them leading to purposeful outcomes. The
content of Unit 1 enables learners to make considered,
informed decisions, reflecting over and justifying their
choices. Skills in self-evaluation, resilience and reflection
are accessed during the compilation of the Reflective Log.
