Information for Teachers

This pack contains information about the assessment materials for Unit 1: Devising Theatre.

Within this pack, you will find:
•
•

information for teachers on how to manage arrangements for assessment
information which must be shared with candidates which tells them about things that they
must and must not do when they are completing the assessment
the mark scheme which must be used to assess candidate work.

•

Managing the assessment

This is a centre-marked (internal) non-examination assessment. The following arrangements
must be followed when managing and marking the assessment.

Resources

Candidates must have access to the NEA brief (released on Portal on September 1st each
year), the information for candidates contained within this handbook and any necessary
resources.
Collaboration

Learners may choose either acting or design.

Learners work in groups of between two and five actors to devise a piece of theatre. Each
group may have up to four designers, each offering a different design skill. Learners must
reflect individually on the process of creating and developing their own piece of theatre and
on the realisation of their performance or design.

All learners must contribute fully to the development and creation of the piece of theatre.
Devised pieces must therefore be carefully developed to ensure that all learners are able to
fully demonstrate their chosen skill.

Centres should also ensure safe working practices for all learners.

Designers may select a different theatre practitioner/company/style/genre to the actors in
their group.

Supervision

•  No formal supervision.
•  There is no restriction on the amount of time learners spend on exploring, creating and

developing their devised performance.

•  Teachers may provide guidance and support to learners to ensure that they have a clear

understanding of the requirements, including the stimuli, the reflective log and the
assessment grid.

•  Once the creating and developing work is underway, feedback must be limited to general
advice on what needs to be improved. Teachers must not provide specific guidance on
how to achieve these improvements.

•  Teachers must see learners’ ideas in progress at least three times at different stages

during the process to be able to authenticate the work as the learner's own and complete
the necessary authentication documentation.

•  Teachers must also see at least one draft of the reflective log but must not provide any

written feedback before the final submission. Feedback must be limited to general advice
and teachers must not provide specific guidance on how to improve the work.

•  Teachers must sign the authentication document to authenticate the reflective log as the

learner's own work.

•  Once the reflective log has been submitted to the teacher to assess, no further

amendments may be made.

Authentication

Candidates can review and redraft evidence independently.

Candidates must sign the declaration to confirm that all evidence submitted for assessment
is their own work and that any sources used have been acknowledged.

Assessors must sign the declaration to confirm that evidence submitted for assessment was
completed under the conditions set out in this assessment.

Weighting:

There are 96 marks awarded in Unit 1
Unit 1 makes up 40% of the GCSE Drama qualification.

Administration

Centres are reminded that the following documentation should be completed for Unit 1:
•  Unit 1 Centre Approval Form
•  Unit 1 Marksheet and Declaration Form
•  Unit 1 Programme Proforma

All information regarding the submission of these forms can be found in our E-Submission
Subject Guide (IAMIS).

Candidate evidence

Performance

The assessor must be present for all performances so that the work can be authenticated.

All performances must be audio-visually recorded by the centre and submitted to WJEC via
IAMIS.

All learners (including designers) must be clearly identified by name and candidate number
at the start of each group performance.

The recording must be of all the performances which have been assessed live by the
assessor.

The recording of each piece must be the complete, unedited performance filmed from the
audience perspective.

Reflective Log
There is no prescribed format regarding the presentation of the reflective log.

Learners can choose to submit the task in any of the formats noted below (or any other
suitable format):
•  audio presentation
•  audio visual presentation
•  PowerPoint
•  written prose.

Marking the assessment

The marking schemes for this assessment are included in Section 3 of this handbook.

All evidence must be assessed against the marking criteria provided. Evidence marked must
comply with any requirements set out in this handbook.

Written evidence must be annotated to show how it relates to the mark band requirements.

Candidate marksheets must include a description of learner performance as well as a
summative statement on the quality of that performance.

Marking should only be undertaken by a designated assessor. An assessor should have
appropriate expertise in the subject and level for a specified unit. The assessor is
responsible for ensuring that:
•  assessment is conducted under the controls specified in this unit
•

they are clear about the requirements of the assessment and marking scheme prior to
commencing assessment

•  evidence presented for assessment is valid, authentic, reliable and credible
•  assessment decisions are accurately recorded
•  evidence is appropriately annotated
•

judgements are only made against the mark band statements.

A mark record sheet must be completed for each candidate. These are stored on the subject
page of the website under NEA.

Further information

You should refer to the JCQ Instructions for conducting non-examination assessment for
further information on managing assessment within our GCSE/Applied Qualifications.

Assessment

The assessment brief is available on WJEC Portal under Non-Examination Assessment
Tasks.

The total mark for this unit is 96.

Assessment may be undertaken at any time during the qualification. However, centres
should ensure that assessment is completed only when learners have undertaken the
necessary teaching and learning and developed the required skills and knowledge.

Work which falls under the time limit will not be penalised. However, centres and learners
should note that work which is significantly short is unlikely to be awarded in the higher mark
bands as there may not be enough evidence of development and/or engagement with the
audience.

Work which exceeds the time limit will not be penalised. However, centres and learners
should note that only work which falls within the maximum timings specified on page 1
should be assessed. The assessor must not award marks once the maximum performance
time has passed.

The moderator will stop watching a performance after the maximum time has been reached
and will only consider work viewed up to this point.
The unit will be internally assessed and externally moderated by WJEC.

There is no specified word count for the Reflective Log.

Guidance for Assessment

Task 1 - Create and develop a piece of theatre

There are assessment grids for the different options available. Assessors should use the
correct grid for the option chosen by the candidate:

•  performance
•
lighting design
•  sound design
•  set and props design
•  costume, hair and make-up design.

There are 4 columns in each grid.

Column 1 within each grid assesses AO4:
•

learners’ ability to create and develop ideas to communicate meaning.

GCSE Drama Unit 1: Devising Theatre NEA Handbook

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2025

Columns 2, 3 and 4 in each grid assess AO2:
•  application of performance or design skills
•
•  contribution to the performance.

interpretation of character(s) or extract(s) and audience engagement

The appropriate band should be established by determining which performance descriptor
best reflects the learner's performance.

The appropriate mark should then be established by determining the extent to which the
learners has met the criteria within the relevant band – completely met (upper part of band),
mostly met (middle of band), partially met (lower part of band).

The total marks for all 4 columns may reflect performance at different bands across the
assessment objectives, for example, a learner may achieve band 4 for column 1 and band 5
for column 2.

Column 1 – Creating and developing ideas (AO4)

When assessing AO4, assessors must consider evidence relating to how the piece has
taken shape and how well learners have created and developed ideas throughout the
rehearsal process.

The following table explains in detail how to assess each bullet point on the assessment grid
for AO4:

Assessment grid

Explanation

For all learners,
consideration
should be given
to:

•

•

ideas, created in response to
the chosen stimulus are
developed to create a piece of
theatre.

relevant performance
techniques/conventions
associated with the chosen
practitioner/company/
style/genre.

•

individual contribution to the
creation and development of
the piece of theatre.

For actors only
consideration
should be given
to:

•  how the chosen

role/character(s) is created and
developed to communicate
meaning.

•  how the performance space is
planned to communicate
meaning.

•  assess to what extent the

learner has created an original
storyline/plot/concept which
shows creativity in response to
the stimulus and how this is
developed into a structured
piece of theatre.

•  assess the effectiveness of the

choice and use of the
practitioner/company’s
techniques/aims or genre
conventions in the creation and
development of the piece of
theatre.

•  assess the individual

contribution of the learner. This
can include ideas which were
tested and rejected as well as
those evident in the final piece.

•  assess choices made about the
role/character(s) during the
development process to
communicate meaning in
various situations.

•  assess the learner’s decisions

during the development process
in regard to the performance
space, including
entrances/exits, levels,
proxemics, audience position to
communicate meaning.

GCSE Drama Unit 1: Devising Theatre NEA Handbook

For designers
only
consideration
should be given
to:

•

the creation and development of
design resources to
communicate meaning.

communicate meaning.

•  assess choices made during
the development process
regarding the use of design
resources to communicate
meaning in various situations.

•  assess how well the design has

been planned during the
development process to
communicate meaning.

Column 2 – Application of performance/design skills (AO2)

This assessment objective is assessed through the realisation of the final performance or
design.

Column 3 – Interpretation of character/the piece and audience engagement (AO2)

This assessment objective is assessed through the realisation of the final performance or
design.

When assessing the interpretation of character (actors) assessors must consider how well
the learner has communicated the character in performance. Was the character(s)
motivations/status/relationships clear? Was the characterisation engaging?

When assessing the interpretation of the piece (designers) assessors must consider how
well the learner has communicated the piece in design. Was there a sense of
location/atmosphere/status/ evident within the design? Was this sustained throughout the
piece? Were there effective subtleties in design?

Column 4 – Contribution to the performance (AO2)

This assessment objective is assessed through the realisation of the final performance or
design.

When assessing the contribution to the performance assessors must consider how well the
individual performance or design contributed to the success of the final performance.

the energy and focus displayed

For actors, consideration should be given to:
•
•  confidence on stage
•  performance time on stage.

For designers, consideration should be given to:
•  how the design communicated atmosphere
•  how the design enhanced the performance
•  how the design enhanced the audience’s understanding and theatrical experience.

Task 2 – Reflective Log

Learners must reflect on the process of creating and developing their own piece of theatre
and on the realisation of their performance or design.

Learners should be able to critically evaluate the effectiveness and impact of their creative
choices linked to their:
•
•  choice of practitioner/company/style/genre
•  application of performance or design skills.

response to their chosen stimulus

The appropriate band should be established by determining which performance descriptor
best reflects the learner's performance.

The appropriate mark should then be established by determining the extent to which the
learners has met the criteria within the relevant band – completely met (upper part of band),
mostly met (middle of band), partially met (lower part of band).
It should be noted that all bands have been designed to assist the marking process by
identifying individual levels of achievement and they do not correlate with grade boundaries.

Design Assessment

Minimum Requirements for Design
The following is a list of minimum requirements for the realisation of each design option:

Lighting design:
•  6 different states
•
•  cue sheets.

learners must operate the lighting board in the performance

Sound design:
•  6 different cues
•
•  cue sheets.

learners must operate the sound desk in the performance

Set design and props design:
•  set and props created and/or dressed for performance of 1 group
•

learners must arrange the props table/set up performance space prior to the
performance and provide a model set. The model may be presented in a digital format.

Costume design, hair and make-up design:
•  1 full costume, hair and make-up for 2 different characters (two costume, hair and make-

up designs in total)

•  sketches of both costume, hair and make-up designs.

A piece of theatre which is significantly below the recommended minimum design
requirements will be unlikely to demonstrate evidence of the skills required to access marks
in the higher bands of the assessment criteria.
