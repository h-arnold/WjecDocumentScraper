# GCSE DRAMA

# <span id="page-5-0"></span>1 INTRODUCTION

# <span id="page-5-1"></span>1.1 Aims

GCSE Drama qualification supports Learners to:

- explore drama created and performed by other people and develop their own talents in drama
- gain understanding of a range of techniques, forms, styles, genres, contexts and means of presenting drama
- develop knowledge, understanding and appreciation of how meaning is communicated in drama
- respond to and reflect on the dramatic work of others, applying knowledge of context to evaluate the effectiveness of ideas and techniques used to communicate meaning
- apply performance and/or design skills to demonstrate control
- develop creative skills to plan, devise and design effective performances and/or designs
- reflect on, refine and evaluate their own work
- explore the cross-cutting themes of human rights and diversity, including Black, Asian, and minority ethnic perspectives, identity, culture, and contributions.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales' Approval Criteria.

# <span id="page-5-2"></span>1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Drama qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of what](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/statements-of-what-matters/)  [matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/statements-of-what-matters/) and those [subject specific skills and concepts](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area) outlined in the ['Designing your](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/designing-your-curriculum/)  [Curriculum'](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/designing-your-curriculum/) section of the Expressive Arts Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted on page 17. The Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

The construct of the GCSE Drama qualification is based on the Welsh Government subject specific considerations for Expressive Arts[1](#page-5-3) .

<span id="page-5-3"></span><sup>1</sup> [Expressive Arts: Designing your curriculum -](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area) Hwb (gov.wales)

{6}------------------------------------------------

The qualification will:

• through the creative process, allow learners to explore, respond to stimuli and create and reflect on their own work while engaging in rich, authentic experiences.

The GCSE Drama qualification focuses on the following, based on the statements of what matter for Expressive Arts[2](#page-6-2) :

- **exploring** the Expressive Arts is essential to developing artistic skills and knowledge and it enables learners to become curious and creative individuals **responding** and **reflecting**, both as artist and audience, is a fundamental part of learning in the Expressive Arts
- **creating** combines skills and knowledge, drawing on the senses, inspiration and imagination.

The GCSE Drama qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:

- supporting the principles of progression[3](#page-6-3)
- encouraging learners to explore, experience, interpret, create and respond to increasingly complex meaning
- developing an increased sophistication of conceptual learning
- more sophisticated use of relevant skills and the ability to transfer existing skills and knowledge into new context.

Supporting the specific considerations for this area[4](#page-6-4) by giving learners the opportunity to:

- explore, respond to stimuli and create and reflect on their own work while engaging in rich, authentic experiences
- build understanding of acting, directing, design, technical theatre and arts administration.

# <span id="page-6-0"></span>1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of Drama at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

# <span id="page-6-1"></span>1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE Drama has been designed to be delivered within 120 – 140 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

{7}------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="page-7-0"></span>1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

#### <span id="page-7-1"></span>1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website [\(www.jcq.org.uk\).](http://www.jcq.org.uk/)

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

{8}------------------------------------------------

# <span id="page-8-0"></span>2 SUBJECT CONTENT

# <span id="page-8-1"></span>How to read the amplification

The amplification provided in the right-hand column, titled 'Further Information' uses the following four stems:

- 'Learners should know' is used when learners are required to use direct recall
- 'Learners should understand' is used when learners are required to demonstrate greater depth than straight identification or recall, for example they can apply knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and can synthesise and evaluate information for a given purpose
- 'Learners should be able to' is used when learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques
- 'Learners are required to' is used to show the requirements of individual units.

The use of the word 'including' indicates that the specified content must be taught and could be subject to assessment.

The use of the words 'for example' or 'such as' indicates that the specified content is for guidance only, and alternative examples could be chosen.

# <span id="page-13-0"></span>Unit 3

#### **Interpreting Theatre**

Digital only examination, marked by WJEC 30% of qualification 72 marks

#### **Overview of unit**

The purpose of this unit is to:

- demonstrate and apply knowledge and understanding of how drama is designed, developed and performed through the context of prepared and unprepared works
- develop learners' creative skills as an actor, designer and director through the context of prepared and unprepared works
- reflect on and analyse the work of others through the context of unprepared work.

#### This unit will focus on:

- exploring learners will have the opportunity to explore various theatrical viewpoints and experiences. This should include a range of techniques, forms, styles and contexts. This exploration will be linked to their chosen set text as well as a range of theatrical productions of contrasting styles/genres, contrasting periods/contexts, works created in or inspired by Wales and works written by a diverse range of writers, including those from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. Learners should have the opportunity for theatrical exploration as an actor, designer and director gathering ideas from a variety of sources to enhance their understanding of drama
- responding and reflecting linked to live and/or recorded/live streamed performances as possible theatrical influences for the set texts and unprepared works. As learners make progress in Unit 3 they increasingly evaluate and create more sophisticated responses, independently to live and/or pre-recorded theatre. Their evaluation of work of others reflects a developing understanding of theatrical experience enabling them to form effective critique.

The texts chosen for Units 2 and 3 must be different.

{14}------------------------------------------------

## <span id="page-16-0"></span>Opportunities for integration of learning experiences

The GCSE Drama generates opportunities for the following learning experiences to be developed (the experiences will not be directly assessed):

- experience a variety of professional performance(s) and/or workshops, either in person or on-screen
- experience a range of roles including performer, designer, director, producer and stage manager
- develop confidence in giving and receiving feedback, promoting independent thinking, originality and creative resilience
- be given opportunities to take risks, use improvisation and overcome creative challenges
- take part in some form of collaborative performance
- gain a basic awareness of ethical and legal considerations as appropriate.

Although learners must work in a pair/group during Unit 1 and Unit 2, they are not assessed on their collaborative skills.

Further amplification of the opportunities to develop cross-cutting themes, cross-curricular skills and integral skills can be found in Appendix C. The Guidance for Teaching will include further information on the opportunities provided by the qualification for teachers/centres to integrate these learning experiences into delivery.

{18}------------------------------------------------

## <span id="page-18-0"></span>3.2 Overview of arrangements for non-examination assessment

#### **Unit 1: Overview**

For this assessment learners are required to:

- create and develop a piece of theatre in response to a stimulus set by WJEC, using either the techniques of an influential theatre practitioner, company or the characteristics of a theatrical style or genre and demonstrate and apply their performance **or** design skills in a live performance
- produce a Reflective Log.

Learners can choose to be assessed on either acting **or** design.

Learners can work in groups of between **two** and **five** actors. Each group may have up to **four** designers, each offering a different design skill.

The length of this piece of theatre will depend on the number of actors in the group and should be as follows:

• Group of two actors: 5-10 minutes • Group of three actors: 7-12 minutes • Group of four actors: 9-14 minutes • Group of five actors: 11-16 minutes.

Each actor must interact with other actors and/or the audience **for a minimum of five minutes**. The number of designers in a group does not impact on the length of the piece.

Learners may complete the assessment anytime during the course. However, centres should ensure that assessment is completed only when learners have undertaken the necessary teaching and learning and developed the required skills and knowledge.

The assessment contributes to 40% of the overall qualification. The unit will be marked out of total of 96 marks.

The stimuli will be released on the WJEC Portal during the September of the first year of study.

This unit will be assessed by the centre and externally moderated by WJEC.

{19}------------------------------------------------

#### **Unit 2: Overview**

For this assessment learners are required to:

- create and develop an extract(s) from a published performance text for performance
- demonstrate and apply performance **or** design skills that will be realised in the final performance*.*

Learners will have free choice of text for Unit 2, however, the choice of text **must** be different to the set text selected in Unit 3.

Learners can choose to be assessed on either acting **or** design. Learners work in groups of between two and four actors. Each group may have up to two designers, each offering a different design skill.

The length of this piece of theatre will depend on the number of actors in the group and should be as follows:

• Group of two actors: 5-10 minutes • Group of three actors: 7-12 minutes • Group of four actors: 9-14 minutes

Each actor must interact with other actors and/or the audience **for a minimum of five minutes**. The number of designers in a group does not impact on the length of the piece.

#### **Viva**

All learners opting for design must give a 3-5 minute presentation of their design to the examiner. The viva is non-assessed and will occur after the performance. It is an opportunity for learners to explain and present their design to the examiner.

This unit will be completed in the final year of study.

The assessment contributes to 30% of the overall qualification. The unit will be marked out of total of 72 marks.

This unit will be assessed by a visiting examiner.

# <span id="page-20-0"></span>4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for GCSE Drama.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our [Guide to preventing, reporting and](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)  [investigating malpractice.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC (malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet [Suspected](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)  [Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)

# <span id="page-21-0"></span>5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

# <span id="page-21-1"></span>5.1 Making entries

This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the course. The non-examination assessment for Unit 1 can be completed earlier in the course but must be submitted at the end of the course. The non-examination assessment for Unit 2 must be completed during the assessment window set by WJEC in the final year of study.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series until the end of the life of this specification. Summer 2027 will be the first assessment opportunity.

A qualification may be taken more than once.

Marks for non-examination assessment (NEA) may be carried forward for the life of the specification. If a candidate resits an NEA unit (rather than carrying forward the previous NEA mark), it is the new mark that will count towards the overall grade, even if it is lower than a previous attempt (unless the mark is absent).

The entry code appears below:
