Generic marking principles

MARK SCHEME

Guidance for examiners

•  Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).

•  Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar

when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark
scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.

•  Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for
the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the
quality of the candidate responses seen).

•  Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme.
Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

Positive marking

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and
credit should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of
penalising candidates for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to
achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be
deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied
precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates’ answers. The list is not
exhaustive. The inclusion of ‘Credit any other valid response.’ (or similar instruction) within
mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates’ responses. Credit should be
given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates’ answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However,
unless there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks
where the answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

Banded mark schemes

For band marked questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the
assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in
candidates’ answers. It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate’s response. As
noted above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive and candidates do not have
to include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

WJEC GCSE Drama Unit 3 Sample External Assessment

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the
requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it
contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been
provided, no marks should be awarded.

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each
candidate’s response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills,
knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors
or omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate’s answer to pick out the evidence
that is being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied. This is done
as a two-stage process.

Stage 1 – Deciding on the band

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate’s answer and check
whether it matches the descriptors for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are
satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band
until the descriptors most closely matches the work.

Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark

Having determined the appropriate band, deciding on the mark within a band will be made
on the basis of a ‘best fit’ procedure, weaknesses in some areas being compensated for by
strengths in others.

Examiners should use the full range of marks available to them. Marking should be positive,
rewarding achievement rather that penalising failure or omissions. The awarding of marks
must be directly related to the marking criteria, and all responses must be marked according
to the banded levels provided for each question.

Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be provided during
standardising and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work.
Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the standardising material as they apply the
mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the
work submitted.

This mark scheme instructs examiners to look for and reward valid alternatives where
indicative content is suggested for an answer. This is not a checklist for expected content in
an answer, or set out as a 'model answer', as responses must be marked in the banded
levels of response provided for each question. Where a candidate provides a response that
contains aspects or approaches not included in the indicative content, examiners should use
their professional judgement to determine the validity of the response in light of the task and
reward as directed by the bands. Candidates are free to choose any approach that is
relevant to the set task. Candidates can (and will most likely) incorporate ideas other than
those mentioned in the mark scheme.

Indicative content

These are examples only and all valid alternatives should be considered and marked appropriately.

Suggestion:
•  The style I have chosen is based on the Punk era.
•  The garments Puck would be wearing would be a t-shirt with holes in and a motif of the Sex

Pistols and baggy jeans with lots of chains, Converse trainers.

•  All his garments would be black with a red SP motif, his shoes would be black and white.
•  His hair would be in a Mohican and he would have black eyeliner around his eyes.

Reason:
•  My reason for this costume is the Punk era is all about rebellion and Puck is a rebellious spirit.
Since Titania and Oberon have quarrelled a darkness has come across Fairyland, the black
colours of the costume could emphasise this.

Indicative content

The following are examples only and all valid alternatives should be considered and marked
appropriately.

Type of stage used in the original production:
First staged in January 1605 at The Curtain Theatre. It was a large octagonal shaped building with a
thrust/apron stage.

Given circumstances
Puck and the Fairy meet, they both follow Titania and Oberon who are sworn enemies.

Location - A wood.

Choice of stage
Candidates must state which stage type they will use either Thrust or Proscenium Arch. Their
response must show an understanding how their choice of stage reflects their choice of set for
example an awareness of sight lines, audience position. The choice of staging should be reflected in
their choice of style.

Production style
Candidates must choose a production style for their staging ideas. Candidates could choose from a
range of styles; however, the chosen style must work on the stage that they have chosen. They must
justify their ideas.

Set
•  The choice of set should reflect the style, for example if candidates choose a minimalistic style

the set would not be detailed/naturalistic.

•  Candidates should show an awareness of all stage areas for example; the area above the stage,

the floor area.

•  Candidates may include the following: backdrops, cycloramas, gauze screens, levels, colour,

texture, period etc. when considering set.

•  Candidates may choose a generic design to emphasise the main themes of the play e.g. love,

dreams, the supernatural.

•  Remember some candidates will have been taught to use lighting/projections/effects to create
set, therefore some candidates could choose to use projections to suggest the wood, and
coloured gels to create atmosphere.

Props
•  Candidates should identify the props they are using. For example, they could be part of the set a

bush or they may decide to use personal props such as a bunch of flowers for the Fairy.

•  Candidates should give specific reasons for each of their props, choices and there should be a

holistic understanding of how all elements i.e. stage, style, set/props work together to produce a
cohesive design.

Indicative content

These are examples only and all valid alternatives should be considered and marked appropriately.

Suggestion:
•  The period I have chosen is the 1930s, the original setting for the play.
•  The garments Amanda would be wearing are a straight tweed skirt to just above her ankles, a

blouse with a frilly collar, a woollen cardigan buttoned up and flat shoes.

•  The skirt would be brown, the blouse white and the cardigan would be cream. The shoes would

be brown with a small gold buckle.

•  Her hair would be neat and tidy in a small bun and she would have some pink lipstick on.

Reason:
•  Amanda’s costume would reflect the period the play is set in. Her costume would look neat and
tidy to emphasise her strict standards and the pride she takes in keeping up appearances. Her
clothes, although neat and tidy would look quite shabby as Amanda lives in relative poverty.

Indicative content

The following are examples only and all valid alternatives should be considered and marked
appropriately.

Type of stage used in the original production:
First staged in Chicago, 1944 at the Civic Theatre. The stage type was a Proscenium Arch.

Given circumstances
Tom and Amanda, mother and son are having an argument.

Location – The Wingfield Apartment.

Choice of stage
Candidates must state which stage type they will use either Thrust or Proscenium Arch. Their
response must show an understanding how their choice of stage reflects their choice of set for
example an awareness of sight lines, audience position. The choice of staging should be reflected in
their choice of style.

Production style
Candidates must choose a production style for their staging ideas. Candidates could choose from a
range of styles; however, the chosen style must work on the stage that they have chosen. They must
justify their ideas.

Set
•  The choice of set should reflect the style, for example if candidates choose a minimalistic style

the set would not be detailed/naturalistic.

•  Candidates should show an awareness of all stage areas for example; the area above the stage,

the floor area.

•  Candidates may include the following: backdrops, cycloramas, gauze screens, levels, colour,

texture, period etc. when considering set.

•  Candidates may choose a generic design to emphasise the main themes of the play e.g.

memories, dreams, isolation.

•  Remember some candidates will have been taught to use lighting/projections/effects to create
set, therefore some candidates could choose to use projections to suggest the room, and
coloured gels to create atmosphere.

Props
•  Candidates should identify the props they are using. For example, they could be part of the set
the typewriter or they may decide to use personal props such as a book which Amanda could
throw at Tom.

•  Candidates should give specific reasons for each of their props, choices and there should be a

holistic understanding of how all elements i.e. stage, style, set/props work together to produce a
cohesive design.

Suggestion:
•  The period I have chosen is the 1943, the original setting for the play.
•  The garments Angela would be wearing are a pretty summer dress with puffed selves and a little

collar, she would have white ankle socks and Mary-Jane shoes.

•  The dress would be pink with tiny white flowers, the socks white and the shoes would be black.
•  Her hair would be long and curled with a big, pink bow at the top, I would use make-up to give her

a healthy, tanned appearance to emphasise it is the summer and the children are playing
outdoors.

Reason:
•  Angela’s costume would reflect the period the play is set in. Her costume would look neat and tidy
even though she is out playing. This emphasises she looks like the perfect little girl and adds to
her status. Her costume would look light and pretty to emphasise summertime to help reinforce
brightness before the loss of innocence at the end of the play.

•  She might keep her distance and stand away from him as she knows Martin feels self-conscious

and does not want him to feel awkward. She smiles to reassure him.

•  She could look away when discussing the other students as she realises this is going to be a

massive hurdle for Martin to overcome and is conscious about raising it. Her worried expression
would show this is a difficult subject to broach.

Suggestion:
•  The period I have chosen is the 2024 as it is a contemporary play.
•  The garments Present Martin would be wearing are jogging bottoms, a hoodie, tee shirt and

trainers.

•  The jogging bottoms and tee shirt would be black, the hoodie grey, trainers white with a blue

stripe.

•  His hair would be shaved on the side where they have had to operate on him, I would use make-

up to show how badly disfigured his face is.

Reason:
•  Martin’s costume looks basic and non-descript. He is recovering at home and since the accident
does not care what he would look like. The clothes would look baggy and relaxed to emphasise
his body is still recovering after the horrific accident, his make-up would also emphasise this to
the audience.

Indicative content

The following are examples only and all valid alternatives should be considered and marked
appropriately.

Type of stage used in the original production:
Originally written as a novel in 1999, the novel was adapted into a play in 2008. It was first performed
at the Anvil theatre, Basingstoke. The Welsh premier was staged by Whitchurch High School in
March 2015.

Given circumstances
Martin’s form teacher has visited him to discuss the future.

Location – A street

Choice of stage
Candidates must state which stage type they will use either Thrust or Proscenium Arch. Their
response must show an understanding how their choice of stage reflects their choice of set for
example an awareness of sight lines, audience position. The choice of staging should be reflected in
their choice of style.

Production style
Candidates must choose a production style for their staging ideas. Candidates could choose from a
range of styles; however, the chosen style must work on the stage that they have chosen. They must
justify their ideas.

Set
•  The choice of set should reflect the style, for example if candidates choose a minimalistic style

the set would not be detailed/naturalistic.

•  Candidates should show an awareness of all stage areas. For example; the area above the

stage, floor area.

•  Candidates may include the following: backdrops, cycloramas, gauze screens, levels, colour,

texture, period etc. when considering set.

•  Candidates may choose a generic design to emphasise the main themes of the play e.g. self -

image, identity, peer pressure.

•  Remember some candidates will have been taught to use lighting/projections/effects to create
set, therefore some candidates could choose to use projections to suggest the street, and
coloured gels to create atmosphere.

Props
•  Candidates should identify the props they are using. For example, they could be part of the set,
like the typewriter, or they may decide to use personal props such as a doll which Audery and
Angela could play.

•  Candidates should give specific reasons for each of their props choices and there should be a

holistic understanding of how all elements i.e. stage, style, set/props work together to produce a
cohesive design.

impose his status, Rafi would look threatening to show he means business.

•  Rafi does not show any respect for Mr Ubsworth, so pushing the older man could emphasise this.

Laughing and grinning would emphasise Rafi thinks he is just a joke.

•  Rafi is the complete opposite to Charlie and the way he mocks the old man emphasises this. Rafi

Suggestion:
•  The period I have chosen is the 1940’s.
•  The garments Mr Ubsworth would be wearing could include baggy pin stripe trousers, covered

with patches, a waistcoat, a white collarless shirt with the sleeves rolled up. A tatty bowler hat and
scruffy shoes.

•  The trousers would be black but faded with red patches, a grey waistcoat, the shirt would be

white but look very grubby. A black bowler hat with a red carnation. The hat should look dusty.
The shoes would be black.

•  His hair is short and neat, he would look tanned from working outside, he would have tattoos up

his arms.

Reason:
•  Although no specific period is given for Lionboy, I think Mr Ubsworth’s costume should represent
a past time when everyone knew their manners. His clothes would look second hand and look
very worn, the red patches give him almost a clownlike appearance.

Originally performed by Complicite in May 2013 at the Old Vic. The stage type was End-On.

Given circumstances
Mr Ubsworth hides Charlie and as a result has a confrontation with Rafi who is desperately looking
for him.

Location – Not specified

Choice of stage
Candidates must state which stage type they will use either Traverse or Proscenium Arch. Their
response must show an understanding how their choice of stage reflects their choice of set for
example an awareness of sight lines, audience position. The choice of staging should be reflected in
their choice of style.

Production style
Candidates must choose a production style for their staging ideas. Candidates could choose from a
range of styles; however, the chosen style must work on the stage that they have chosen. They must
justify their ideas.

Set
•  The choice of set should reflect the style, for example if candidates choose a minimalistic style

the set would not be detailed/naturalistic.

•  Candidates should show an awareness of all stage area. For example; the area above the stage,

floor area.

•  Candidates may include the following: backdrops, cycloramas, gauze screens, levels, colour,

texture, period etc. when considering set.

•  Candidates may choose a generic design to emphasise the main themes of the play e.g. family,

power, animal cruelty.

•  Remember some candidates will have been taught to use lighting/projections/effects to create
set, therefore some candidates could choose to use projections to suggest the circus, and
coloured gels to create atmosphere.

Props
•  Candidates should identify the props they are using. For example, they could be part of the set

e.g. a trapeze or they may decide to use personal props e.g. Mr Ubsworth could have a basket of
rubber tubes.

•  Candidates should give specific reasons for each of their props choices and there should be a

holistic understanding of how all elements i.e. stage, style, set/props work together to produce a
cohesive design.

•  Award 1 mark for each reason for recommendation up to a maximum of 2 marks. There should

reasons should display knowledge and understanding of the character, the given circumstances
of the extract and be linked to their costume description.

Indicative content

These are examples only and all valid alternatives should be considered and marked appropriately.

Suggestion:
•  Resting Restless is a contemporary play and Mabli’s costume would reflect the period of 2024.
•  She is wearing school trousers, a white blouse, her tie would be undone. Mabli is also wearing a
hoodie. She would be wearing trainers. She would have a wrist band on and lots of bracelets.
•  The trousers would be grey, shirt white and the tie red and green. She would have a navy hoodie

with a white Superdry logo on. The wristband would be rainbow coloured and she’d have a
number of silver bangles on.

•  Her hair would be short gelled up into spikes, it would have plum highlights. She would be

wearing some black eye liner.

Reason:
•  Mabli is at school so her costume would have some aspects of a school uniform. As she is not
taking part in the dance, I would imagine she is wearing a hoodie and it is wrapped around her
almost like a comfort blanket as perhaps she is still feeling fragile after getting drunk over the
previous weekend. Mabli is a confident person so there would be elements which add to her
individuality like the colour/style of her hair and her jewellery. As she is gay, I would put a rainbow
wristband on from some festival she has been to, to emphasise she is out and is perfectly at
ease.

•  Award 1 mark for suitable garments.
•  Award 1 mark for suitable colour.
•  Award 1 mark for suitable hair and make-up.
•  Award 1 mark for each reason for recommendation up to a maximum of 2 marks. There should
be two distinct reasons in order for the candidate to be awarded a maximum of 2 marks. The
reasons should display knowledge and understanding of the character, the given circumstances
of the extract and be linked to their costume description.

Indicative content

These are examples only and all valid alternatives should be considered and marked appropriately.

Suggestion:
•  The period I have chosen is 2024.
•  The garments Cam would be wearing are school trousers, jumper, shirt, tie, puffa jacket, trainers.
•  The trousers would be black, a grey jumper, the shirt would be white. A grey puffa jacket. The

shoes would be black.

•  His hair is short and neat, he would look pale with black shadows under his eyes.

Reason:
•  Cam is a nervous schoolboy and normally does not want to stand out, so his school uniform
would be understated with nothing to make him stand out. As he is recovering from glandular
fever, he’d be wearing a thick jacket to keep him warm. He would look very pale as he is still
recovering.

Indicative content

The following are examples only and all valid alternatives should be considered and marked
appropriately.

Type of stage used in the original production:
Written specifically as part of the NT connections in 2020/2021. First performed by Headington
school, Oxford on a Proscenium Arch Stage.

Given circumstances
Everyone is waiting to see what will happen next.

Location – A school yard.

Choice of stage
Candidates must state which stage type they will use either Thrust or Proscenium Arch. Their
response must show an understanding how their choice of stage reflects their choice of set for
example an awareness of sight lines, audience position. The choice of staging should be reflected in
their choice of style.

Production style
Candidates must choose a production style for their staging ideas. Candidates could choose from a
range of styles; however, the chosen style must work on the stage that they have chosen. They must
justify their ideas.

Set
•  The choice of set should reflect the style, for example if candidates choose a minimalistic style

the set would not be detailed/naturalistic.

•  Candidates should show an awareness of all stage areas. For example the area above the stage,

floor area.

•  Candidates may include the following: backdrops, cycloramas, gauze screens, levels, colour,

texture, period etc. when considering set.

•  Candidates may choose a generic design to emphasise the main themes of the play e.g.

friendship, memories, grief, loneliness.

•  Remember some candidates will have been taught to use lighting/projections/effects to create
set, therefore some candidates could choose to use projections to suggest the yard, and
coloured gels to create atmosphere.

Props
•  Candidates should identify the props they are using. For example, they could be part of the set

e.g. bins or they may decide to use personal props e.g. mobile phones.

•  Candidates should give specific reasons for each of their props choices and there should be a

holistic understanding of how all elements i.e. stage, style, set/props work together to produce a
cohesive design.

Appendix A – WJEC Drama Digital Assessment

Digital Assessment Information

1.  Arrangements and access of the digital examination:

Digital examinations will be delivered to centres through Surpass software. An
application named WJEC SecureClient will need to be installed on candidate’s PC’s
within centres so that candidates can complete the exams. The Surpass software will be
available throughout the academic year and centres will be encouraged to complete
practice exams (e.g. Digital Specimen Assessment Materials and past papers as they
become available) using the on-screen assessment software so that candidates can
familiarise themselves with the software in readiness for the live exams.

2.  Controls within digital examination:

Centre staff will need to:
•  modify the duration of on-screen exams for candidates that require additional time

(access arrangements)

•  ensure invigilators can log into Surpass to be able to pause and resume exams

during the delivery of on-screen exams. Used for candidates who have supervised
rest breaks (access arrangements) and for individual or cohort issues that may occur
during live exams e.g. disruption.

Candidates will have the ability to:
•  change the colour preferences of the on-screen exam.
•  zoom in/out functionality.

3.  Candidate instructions for digital examinations:

Centres will be provided with a Candidate User Guide for candidates completing on-
screen assessments. The Surpass software will be available throughout the academic
year and centres will be encouraged to complete practice exams (e.g. Digital Specimen
Assessment Materials and past papers as they become available) using the on-screen
assessment software so that candidates can familiarise themselves with the software in
readiness for the live exams.

4.  Digital examination arrangements – clarity over support:

Live exams will be scheduled by WJEC at least 7 days before the date of the exam. The
‘Home ’screen of Surpass will contain information to assist with the installation and
testing of the software as well as a user guide detailing the administration process of
delivering on-screen exams within a centre.
