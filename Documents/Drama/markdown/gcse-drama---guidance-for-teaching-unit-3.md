Overview of Unit 3

Interpreting Theatre
Digital only examination, marked by WJEC
30% of qualification
72 marks

The purpose of this unit is to:
•  demonstrate and apply knowledge and understanding of how drama is designed,
developed and performed through the context of prepared and unprepared works

•  develop learners’ creative skills as an actor, designer and director through the context of

prepared and unprepared works
reflect on and analyse the work of others through the context of unprepared work.

•

This unit will focus on:
•  exploring – learners will have the opportunity to explore various theatrical viewpoints and
experiences. This should include a range of techniques, forms, styles and contexts. This
exploration will be linked to their chosen set text as well as a range of theatrical
productions of contrasting styles/genres, contrasting periods/contexts, works created in or
inspired by Wales and works written by a diverse range of writers, including those from
Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. Learners should have the opportunity for
theatrical exploration as an actor, designer and director gathering ideas from a variety of
sources to enhance their understanding of drama.

•  responding and reflecting – linked to live and/or recorded/live streamed performances as
possible theatrical influences for the set texts and unprepared works. As learners make
progress in Unit 3, they increasingly evaluate and create more sophisticated responses,
independently to live and/or pre-recorded theatre. Their evaluation of work of others
reflects a developing understanding of theatrical experience enabling them to form
effective critique.

The texts chosen for Units 2 and 3 must be different.

3.1.1
How drama
and theatre
is designed,
developed
and
performed

Learners should understand:
how drama and theatre is designed, developed and
performed.

Centres will select one of the set texts below:

It is expected that learners will approach the study of the text practically
as an actor, designer and director. The following practical work could
be used to introduce the chosen set, recapping on the set text,
characters and focusing on specific elements in Unit 3.
Below are some examples of lesson activities that could be helpful:

A Midsummer Night’s Dream William Shakespeare
The Glass Menagerie Tennessee Williams
Blue Remembered Hills Dennis Potter
Face Benjamin Zephaniah
Lionboy Zizou Corder adapted by Marcelo Dos Santos
Resting Restless Bethan Marlow
Tuesday Alison Carr.

Introducing your set text:
This introductory lesson is an effective approach in helping to engage
learners and provide a creative, practical pathway into the chosen set
text:
The 6 objects chosen should be linked to some aspect of the play, e.g.,
theme, character, event. The purpose of this exercise is not for them to
“guess the play” but to stimulate discussion and practical work which
will eventually be linked to the specific text chosen by the centre. The
objects are placed on a table and covered before the learners enter the
classroom. The teacher explains that for the first few minutes they want
the learners to sit in silence and carefully look and think about the
items. E.g., are the items contemporary or could they belong to a
different era? What type of character could own a specific item? Would
the items suggest a happy or sad atmosphere?

Suitable music is chosen, the objects are uncovered, and the learners
are given time to observe and think in silence. The teacher will then
lead the discussion and question the learners about their thoughts and
ideas. Teachers should remember to keep the original play in mind,
e.g., if one of the items is a mirror and the studied play is Face. You
might expect learners to offer the suggestion “the play is about image,”
however, the teacher might develop the questioning by asking key
questions such as, “Why do you think the mirror is cracked”.

  GCSE Drama Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 6

The class is divided into groups (4+) for a timed activity, e.g., 5 minutes
to sit and discuss a plotline linked to the objects.

Timed activity:
The groups arrange their plot line into 6 images, viewed by the class,
and the class is encouraged to ask questions, e.g., why is a specific
character separate from the others?

The groups revisit their frames but this time they can add a maximum
of 6 words per frame. This will allow them to choose and think carefully
about their choices and delivery lines.

After these are viewed and discussed, the exercise has provided a
springboard to introduce the set text. If the objects are chosen
carefully, the learners will have picked up on some key ideas.
The teachers should then verbally recap the summary of the chosen
performance text, referring to the items whilst doing it.

Diluting a key scene:
This is a useful activity to help learners to focus in detail on specific
extracts from a performance text, to dilute a specific extract into key
moments and to focus on aspects of movement, proxemics and spatial
awareness with links to Unit 3 (Section A).

Outline:
Choose a key scene from selected performance text and read through
with learners. Divide the class into groups, depending on how many
key characters are in the scene. Each group then compiles a list,
diluting the scene into between 5 -7 key moments. They then present
“a storyboard” or linked still images of the diluted scene.

Learners must focus on the positioning of each character, use of
space, etc. (you can use a template of a storyboard for them to plot it).
Once the learners are familiarised with running order and positioning,
each scene is brought to life, there is no dialogue and the focus is on
clarity and precision of movement, e.g., posture, space, etc. Teachers

should encourage learners not to complicate things, but to keep it
“clean” and focused.

Development:
Finding key words from the selected scene and adding them to each
frame can develop this exercise further. Learners should focus on tone,
tempo, etc.

This is a useful exercise when preparing learners for Unit 3 (Section A),
the wider knowledge question. It helps them to work through a scene
focusing on the beginning, middle and end and what are the key
moments.

Table - Top Shakespeare:
Complete Works: Table Top Shakespeare Trailer (youtube.com).
This technique was devised by theatre company ‘Forced
Entertainment,’ and it involves using everyday objects to focus and
familiarise on characters and events in specific extracts.

This exercise could be adapted for any of the set texts as a way of
familiarising learners with specific characters, relationships and
recapping on events.

Getting to know characters:
This is a useful exercise to help learners develop a greater
understanding of a key character, an understanding of the performance
text through a range of practical activities, an understanding of specific
events/relationships within the performance text and their impact on
specific characters. This will help the learner develop an understanding
of how practical work can be used in Unit 3 (Section A).

Getting to know a character: “This is your life”:
This exercise as a whole class improvisation (especially a small GCSE
class) is useful, as the significant characters do not have to leave the
stage. Instead, those relationships can be explored further, especially
with the addition of other significant people on stage.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd.2025.

7

  GCSE Drama Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 8

Explain the concept of “This is your life” to learners (clips available on
YouTube) then divide them into groups between 4-6. Each group is
given a specific character from the play.

Each group decides who will be the presenter, the character whose life
they are exploring and the other characters the group think are
important.

Each group prepares an improvisation, during which, the first character
presents to the audience a brief outline of the second (central)
character biography in chronological order.

Each time a significant person from the characters past in mentioned
they come on stage, played by the other actors in the group, and a
short scene follows where the central character meets the significant
person.

Development:
This exercise really involves quite a lot of close text analysis and
making reasonable and informed assumptions based on what you have
learnt from the text. For example, every character has a mother but
how do they feel about her and how did they act around her?

This is a useful exercise for learners to spend time planning rather than
an “off the cuff” improvisation as it helps to develop an in-depth
understanding of the play and specific characters.

Getting to know a character: Recent, Short and Long Past:
Group works in pairs. As there is a certain amount of close text study
that will need to take place to discover facts about the past
relationships between the characters, learners need to be given time to
research.
In pairs, learners act out a most recent meeting of two characters in the
play that you are studying. Add to that, an improvisation of a meeting
between the two characters in the short-term past.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd.2025.

  GCSE Drama Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 9

Finally add to that an improvisation of a meeting between the two
characters that is in the long-term past. The scenarios for these scenes
are very much linked to the backstories of the two characters involved.

Development:
This exercise could be linked to this type of question:
Briefly describe the relationship between **** &**** in this extract (2).

Explain how the two actors could use voice to communicate this
relationship to an audience (4)

3.1.2
How the
actor,
designer and
director
communicate
meaning to
an audience
through the
study of a set
text

Learners should be able to:
identify and describe using drama terminology how the actor,
designer and director communicate meaning to an audience
through the study of their chosen set text.

Learners should be able to:
understand how an actor(s) communicates meaning to an
audience through:
interpretation of character (motivations and
relationships)
character interaction
use of physical skills
use of vocal skills.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd.2025.

10

  GCSE Drama Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 10

Embedding drama terminology into practical work:
The learners understanding of drama terminology should be embedded
into practical work linked to their chosen set text. Exercises could be
used to explore how vocal choices can communicate character to an
audience, whilst familiarising the learner with terminology using a
specific exercise.

Present the learners with an improvised scenario based on 2
characters from their chosen set text, for example, Lionboy; the CEO
phones Rafi regarding his failure to carry out orders.

Divide the learners into pairs giving each learner a sheet with the
following 6 letters: A,B,C,D,E,F.

Learners then have ten minutes to write six lines of dialogue (each pair
write three lines each) but each line must begin with the allotted letter.
Once they have written the dialogue and familiarised themselves with
it, they will need to focus on the tone, tempo, and volume. Teachers
should encourage learners to write these terms as stage directions.

Record the scenarios as mini radio plays.

Question the learners whether their selected vocal choices are
conveying for example the mood of the characters.

In order for learners to be able to understand how an actor(s)
communicates meaning to an audience through interpretation of
character, they could use physical skills. Practical exploration should
always be the starting point which will allow learners to creatively
explore their interpretation of a character within selected scenes. Their
practical exploration could then be linked to a specific past exam
question, which could be discussed orally and then formalised through
written work.

  GCSE Drama Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 11

Outline:
Teachers are to choose two contrasting scenes from the chosen set
text. Try to choose extracts which are quite brief which will allow
learners to focus on detail.

Read and discuss the scenes and question learners. Examples of
questions could be:
What is the mood of this scene?
Where does it take place?
What is the relationship between the characters?

Allot each learner a different character from the extract.

Practical activity:
Learners find a space and create a physical silhouette for one of the
characters in one of the chosen extracts. They should focus on
exaggerating the stance, e.g., posture, fingers, and position of feet.
Whilst in that position ask them to consider which part of their body
their character would “lead with” if they were entering the scene.

Their silhouette is brought “to life,” and they move around the space,
moving and leading with chosen body part. Teachers should question
the learners with questions such as
why has a specific body part been chosen for a specific character?

Develop thinking by asking learners to think of 2 specific words to
describe the movement, e.g., hard and brittle. Learners move in a way
that highlights their chosen words. G

Teachers should give specific locations to keep learners focused, e.g.,
the character is entering a nightclub, an interview, sitting having a drink
with a friend.

Possible teachers question:

© WJEC CBAC Ltd.2025.

11

  GCSE Drama Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 12

How would they describe their character’s motivation when moving in a
specific way?
In pairs/groups they improvise one of the selected scenes starting with
the silhouette of the character and embedding their ideas for movement
and gesture into the physicality of the character.

The scene could initially be improvised focusing on movement only.
Repeat the exercise with the second scene, comparing the movement
in each scene and what it communicates to an audience.
This type of exercise will also help learners to focus on interaction
between characters. For example, if one character’s movement is hard
and brittle and the other character’s movement is soft and fluffy, how
could that effect the interaction?
The learner’s practical exploration could then be linked to past exam
questions for example:
Questions linked to movement:
As an actor playing the role of *** describe how you would enter the
stage at the beginning of this extract. In your answer refer to movement
and gesture (2).
Give two reasons for your suggestions (2).

As an actor, state one movement, one gesture and one facial
expression you would use to communicate the character of **** to an
audience (3).
Give reasons for your suggestions (2).

Explain how the actor performing ****** could use physical skills to
communicate the character to an audience in this extract, giving
reasons for your ideas. In your answer refer to:
Character motivation
Posture and movement
Gesture
Facial Expression (12).

Learners should be able to:
understand how a designer communicates meaning to an
audience through:
costume, hair and make-up
lighting
sound
set and props
use of the stage including:
proscenium arch
theatre in the round
thrust
traverse.

  GCSE Drama Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 13

Design
Learners should be familiar with the four main types of stage
(Proscenium Arch, Theatre in the Round, Thrust and Traverse). They
should be aware of audience position, site lines, the main areas which
would be used when designing for a specific stage, the style of design
which could be explored, for example, a naturalistic design with a
proscenium arch stage.
It is envisaged that through practical exploration in Units 1 & 2 learners
will be familiar with how each of the different stages impacts on the
designer, actor and audience.
Practical exploration of stage types:
In pairs/groups learners read the opening scene of the play and they
stage their initial ideas for the opening scene.

Teachers should question them:
Where were the audience?
Were there any props or furniture used? If so, why?
Learners should list what they discovered about the characters.
They should then read the scene again, noting three things on the
script, character motivation, character positioning and character
movement.

Learners should use different colour highlighters or pens for each of the
points above as they go through the script.

Learners now stage the same extract in the round using no furniture,
then stage it on a traverse stage.

Discuss the differences between each staging.

Through this activity, learners should start to see how the dynamics
between characters change with different stage shapes.  The stage
type should be the starting point for design activities.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd.2025.

Practical activity:

13

  GCSE Drama Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 14

Teachers should choose a short extract from the opening of the chosen
set text. Remove any stage directions, leaving just the dialogue.

Choose one of the 4 main stage types. In pairs/groups allow learners
time to familiarise with the extract (refer to exercise above) and decide
where it is set.

Learners then complete a ground plan for the scene, locating entrances
and exits. They then focus on the following areas building up a
complete picture of their ideas.

Set:
Style of set e.g., naturalistic; non- naturalistic; expressionistic;
minimalistic; abstract or other style. Any other set content such as
furniture, flats, stairs, flooring, levels, windows, etc.
Anything over the stage. Colour? Textures? What props are needed?

Lighting:
Where is the scene located?
What is the mood at the beginning, middle, end of scene?
Where is the lighting positioned on the type of stage you have chosen?
Do you need any colour in the scene?
Do you need any gobos/projections for the scene? Do you need to use
haze?
Does the LX change from the beginning of the extract to the end?
Does any character or part of the set need highlighting?

Sound:
Sound design is any sound that is not created live on stage.
Sound effects, e.g., wind, rain, radio playing on stage.
Underscoring – music under a scene. Soundscape – a sound creation
that could play throughout the play or at significant moments.
Use of voice is not SFX unless they are ‘miked’ to create a certain
effect.

14

  GCSE Drama Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 15

Costume:
Costume should fit in with the whole concept, for example, if the
learners decide their set design reflects the 1940’s, the costume should
reflect this.
Costumes could be from one period or eclectic.
Costumes should reflect the characters in the extract.
Colour and type of costume is essential.
Fabric - remember accessories and footwear.
Hair should reflect the character – style and colour.
Make-up should reflect the action in the extract and character.

The purpose of this exercise is to encourage learners to creatively
express their own design ideas and to familiarise them with the key
elements and the key terminology associated with design.

Encourage learners to keep notes of their ideas and experiment with
different stages, design ideas and extracts throughout the course.
Once learners are confident, gradually introduce GCSE design
questions, for example:

Describe how you would stage this extract for a performance of *****.
In your answer refer to:
The first staging of the original production
Your choice of stage
Production style
Set and props
Reasons for your choices

(12)

Extension exercises:
Each pair/groups prepares a model of their set design using a different
stage type.
Encourage learners to prepare a mood board of their creative ideas.
Allow learners to “mark” their set design out using chairs to represent
different objects on their set so are aware of site lines, audience
position, etc.

  GCSE Drama Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 16

Familiarise learners with the work of current designers to help develop
and develop and inspire their own creative ideas for example:
59 Productions.
Es Devlin: The Lehman Trilogy: The Crucible.
Bunny Christie: Curious Incident: People, Places and Things: The Red
Barn: Ink.
Tom Piper: Macbeth.
Miriam Buether: Stranger Things.
Mark Henderson: Enron: Gypsy.
Nb: The design question should focus on:
Only the design elements stated in the rubric.
It should not focus on character positioning unless the question
specifically states character positioning.
Their design ideas should reflect either the extract chosen by WJEC
(questions 1-3) or their chosen extract (Q4).

Lessons to focus on specific design ideas such as:
Highly detailed knowledge of how ******* could be used to
communicate meaning.
Highly appropriate references to the extract.
Highly appropriate knowledge, understanding and use of drama
terminology.

Whichever aspect of design the question focuses on, band 5 requires a
“highly detailed” response. The following ideas could be developed into
several lessons which would allow learners to focus on specific design
ideas.
Sound and Music:
Examples of activities relating to sound and music:
In groups of four, learners record a soundscape, which could be used
for the opening scene of their set text. They will decide at which points
it will be played and they record their ideas using a cue sheet. Learners
will need to decide where it would fade in and out, volume etc.
Learners will also need to explain their reasons for choosing their
specific soundscape, for example, to help create atmosphere, location,
environment, or the period of the play.

© WJEC CBAC Ltd.2025.

16

  GCSE Drama Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 17

In pairs, learners research and find four pieces of contemporary music
or songs, which could be used for 4 extracts. They will decide at which
points it will be played and record their ideas using a cue sheet. They
will need to decide where it would fade in and out, volume etc.
Learners will also need to explain their reasons for choosing their
specific soundscape, for example to help create atmosphere, location,
environment, or the period of the play.

In pairs, learners are given a specific character from the set text and
decide a piece of music or a song, which could be used as the
character’s “theme.” They will need to decide when it would be
appropriate to play the music and explain the reasons for their choices.

In pairs, learners are given a variety of short extracts from the set text.
They will resource the sound effects. Learners will then decide at which
points the sound effects will be played and record their ideas using a
cue sheet. They will need to decide where it would fade in and out,
volume, etc. Learners will also need to explain their reasons for
choosing their specific soundscape, for example, to help create
atmosphere, location, environment, or the period of the play.

Questions that could be offered to learners:
Describe two suitable sound effects you would in this section (2).

Give two reasons why the sound affects you have chosen would help
an audience to understand the atmosphere of the extract (4).

Nb: The following clip is a useful resource to explain the importance of
sound in theatre: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGtX9P8gDI8

Props:
Learners frequently forget to mention props in design focused.
questions. The following clip highlights for learners the importance and
significance of props in a play:

© WJEC CBAC Ltd.2025.

17

Learners should be able to:
understand how a director communicates meaning to an
audience through:
interpretation of character motivations and

relationships

the use of rehearsal techniques
the chosen performance style
the chosen design style
the choice of stage including:
proscenium arch
theatre in the round
thrust
traverse.

Learners should know:
the social, historical and cultural context in which the set text
was originally performed.

  GCSE Drama Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 18

Adam Savage Examines the Props of Hamilton! (youtube.com).

The following information is also useful for learners to read and develop
an understanding of how props can be used in performance. This
could be shared with learners:

Props are usually handheld items used or held by actors onstage to
make the play more realistic. Props are particularly important if your set
is minimalistic as they can help to give a sense of location, for example,
a table can suggest several locations just with a simple change of
props: 2 coffee cups can suggest a café, but if they are changed to two
wine glasses it can suggest a bar.

Props can also help to show a depth of character in a simple but
effective way. By using props symbolically, you can create powerful
and profound images for your audience. Props can also help to pace a
play.

Splendid Productions are a theatre company who use a minimal set but
rely on props to effectively create several different locations and
characters. They also use props to create mood and atmosphere.
Learners could watch this clip and note what props have been chosen
and how they are used: Trailer for Splendid Productions' 'Woyzeck' on
DVD (2015) (youtube.com)

Activities that could enhance understanding on the use of props:

Learners work in pairs/groups and are given short extracts from the set
text and make a list of which props they would use and how and why
they would be used. They then write a description of the prop to clarify
exactly what they want to use.

Learners work in pairs/groups on a specific scene and are allotted a
specific character from the scene. They choose 2 props for their
character; the scene is presented twice and each time the character
must use their props in a different way to communicate a different

18

  GCSE Drama Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 19

meaning to an audience. For examples, Laura in ‘The Glass
Menagerie’, could hold one of her glass animals very tightly to her. This
communicates to the audience that those glass animals are her comfort
blanket, or, she could place them gently on the palm of her hand to
indicate they are the focus of her world.

Costume:
Activities that could enhance understanding on the use of costume:
In pairs learners are given a specific character from an extract of the
set text. They write a detailed description of the character’s costume,
hair and make-up and using a Traverse Stage, they present their ideas.
One learner be the character, “modelling” the costume, the other will be
the commentator, describing the costume to the rest of the group.
Learners are given this question to consider immediately after the
exercise.

Suggest a suitable costume, hair and make-up for ***** in this section
(4).
Give two reasons why the costume, hair and make-up you have
chosen would help an audience to understand the character of ***** in
this section (4).

This is a useful clip for learners to view to consolidate their
understanding of how detail on a character’s costume can
communicate specific meaning to an audience:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3hYpIwDoQA

Director:
The role of the director should be explored in conjunction with the role
of the actor, for example, the learner should be familiar with a selection
of rehearsal techniques a director could use with an actor when
exploring a specific character. Examples of these activities are:
Hot seating
Role on the Wall
Status Exercises
7 levels of Tension

© WJEC CBAC Ltd.2025.

19

  GCSE Drama Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 20

Nb: Centres may consider a variety of different techniques, and not just
stick to one.

Learners should be aware of why a director would choose a specific
technique and how that technique could help the actor to understand a
character at a specific moment within the play.

Directors and Spatial relationships:
Learners should be familiar with the term ‘spatial relationships’.

This refers to the relationship between the actors in the performance
space. It also refers to the relationship between the actor and the stage
equipment and the set in the performance space. It is the role of the
director to determine the above.

The director will have to decide how to use the space, what size the set
and stage equipment will be and which parts of the space will be the
actors' territories. Another point for consideration, of course, is
determining the audience’s position, e.g., how close they are to the
stage.

These decisions will be crucial during the rehearsal period when they
are blocking the production and during the director's discussions with
the designers. The director's challenge is to use the space to its full
potential.

Activity:
Learners are given a short extract from the set text and placed in
groups according to the number of characters in the extract. The role of
one member is director. Each group is also given one of the four main
stage types.

Learners rehearse the extract, collaborating with the director on
entrances and exits, spatial relationships, positioning and the quality of
movement. The director makes brief notes throughout the rehearsal.

In groups learners then discuss the following question:
Explain how a director would use movement to communicate character
relationships to an audience.  In your answer refer to:
Your choice of stage
Character positioning
Characters movement
Reasons for your choices (12).

This section of the examination will allow learners to explore a wide
range of theatrical viewpoints and experiences over the duration of the
course. All learners should feel confident in expressing their opinion as
well as in their ability to analyse different styles of theatre. It is
imperative that this section of the exam is not taught in isolation but is
seen as an integral part of Units 1 and 2.

Teachers should encourage exploration of a variety of different
styles/genres. These must include work that is created in, and/or
inspired by Wales, as well as work that is written by writers both from
Wales as well as those with diverse backgrounds.

Learners should be able to identify the main characteristics of the 4
stated performance styles on which this section of the exam will be
based:

Naturalism: A performance that involves real life issues and topics;
audience sympathises with characters; dialogue and movement is
realistic and reflects the situation; full costume, set, props and sound
that accurately reflect the situation.

Musical Theatre: Combines songs, spoken dialogue, acting and dance.
The story and emotional content are communicated through words,
music and movement. Musicals tell a story covering a range of
emotions, which are usually heightened by the music and song. There
is usually a protagonist, an antagonist and a chorus. Design elements
tend to be extravagant.

Learners should be able to:
identify and describe various performance styles/genres
including:
naturalism
musical theatre
physical theatre
theatre in education.

Physical Theatre: The storytelling is predominately told through the
actors using their bodies to convey the moods, atmosphere and
feelings. There is an emphasis on visual imagery and symbolism, and
this would be reflective in both the acting and design elements.

Theatre in Education: Structure is episodic, characters tend to be
stereotypical or caricatures to make an immediate point to an audience.
Visual technical elements are used to emphasise a message, e.g.,
PowerPoints, placards, a use of basic set. The performance usually
carries a message for a specific target audience.

Throughout the course learners should be given the opportunity to
experiment with these different styles and become familiar with the
characteristics associated with them through their own devised work.
For example, throughout year 10 teachers could use the range of past
exam stimuli and learners could base their devised work on these
different styles.

Although they may not to decide to base their final Unit 1 performance
on one of these 4 styles, this type of work will help to develop their
confidence in recognising the difference and giving learners the
appropriate terminology to discuss their work and the work of others.

Learners do not need to view a range of full productions, but
throughout the course, they should be given the opportunity to view a
wide range of short extracts of the 4 main genres, all of which are
available online. The centre should strive to ensure learners see a
range of work from diverse companies (see below for examples).

Learners should be given the opportunity to discuss and evaluate the
work using a range of methods as well as the formalised written
response, for example:

Learners view a clip and then in pairs, they present their views on
either the acting or design elements, using the format of a TV interview.

Learners should be able to:
analyse and evaluate using drama terminology how the
actor, designer and director communicate meaning to an
audience through the study of unprepared extracts.

  GCSE Drama Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 23

Learners view two clips of different styles of theatre. In groups they
present an “arts feature”, where they discuss the different elements.
One of the group members could present the feature with a range of
questions, whilst the other learners could be theatre critics.  The
presentation could be filmed and viewed so a range of opinions are
offered.

Immediately after this exercise learners could be given the more
formalised exam type questions to complete, for example:
Look at **** costume, hair and make-up.
Discuss their costume, hair and make-up (discussion points could
include type of costume, style, colour, accessories etc).
Explain how the costume, hair and make-up are used to communicate
meaning?
How effective do you think the costume, hair and make-up are?

How actors communicate meaning:
Throughout the course learners should be given the opportunity to
analyse and evaluate their own and the work of others within the group.
This should be the starting point, so that they gain confidence in their
own opinions and are given both the key elements of performance to
focus on as well as the relevant terminology.

These analyses and evaluation could take the form of both written and
oral work.

Whilst preparing learners for this section of the exam, centres have the
freedom to choose their own online/live extracts of theatre. However, it
is integral that learners are given a diverse range of acting
performances to view, for example:
Learners could view clips from the same production by a range of
companies:
Macbeth/ Focusing on the characters of Macbeth
Clip 1 Christopher Eccleston: Macbeth | Royal Shakespeare Company |
Marquee TV (youtube.com) ( RSC).

Learners should be able to:
analyse and evaluate how an actor(s) communicates
meaning to an audience through:
interpretation of character (motivations and
relationships)
character interaction
use of physical skills
use of vocal skills.

Tragedy of Macbeth (2021) (youtube.com).
Clip 3 Macbeth in Welsh (1964) | BBC Wales (youtube.com).
Clip 4 Shakespeare's Macbeth Tara Arts (youtube.com).
(Note: in the exam learners will be given theatre clips).
When answering questions, teachers should focus specific questioning
on a specific section of the performance for example:
Analyse and evaluate the vocal skills of Macbeth in each of these clips.
Teachers should begin by giving learners very short clips to view so
they can look in detail at a specific area, for example, voice, movement.
Teachers should ensure learners have the necessary drama
terminology which will enable them to frame their responses.

How designers communicate meaning:
As with actors, how designers communicate meaning should initially be
framed within their own experience of analysing and evaluating the
effectiveness of the different elements of design within their own work.

An activity could include:
In groups learners' research and present to the rest of the class, the
key questions, costume/hair and make-up, sound, lighting, set and
props, a designer needs to think about before embarking on a design
project.

An effective starting point for learners to begin analysing and
evaluating theatre design is by focusing on specific images. Learners
work in pairs and are given areas on which to focus on, for example,
colour and texture. Teachers should encourage them to make
decisions on which type of stage is used.

Learners should be able to:
analyse and evaluate how a designer communicates
meaning to an audience through:

Learners should be encouraged to express their ideas confidently, in
the knowledge that theatre is frequently based on how the individual
interprets it, for example: Look at the image below:

Learners should be able to:
analyse and evaluate how a director communicates
meaning to an audience through:
interpretation of character motivations and relationship

Discuss the lighting used in this moment?
Discuss how effective you think the lighting is in this image?

25

  GCSE Drama Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 26

Learners should be given the opportunity to view a range of clips
focusing on different styles/elements of design. They should be
encouraged to consider how the designs could be adapted when
considering their ideas for the design element for their set text (Section
A) and how they adapt ideas for their own work in Units 1 and 2.

Balcony Scene - Romeo and Juliet - YouTube
Romeo and Juliet balcony scene (youtube.com)
Discuss the set design in both clips above.
Discuss which design is used most effectively by the actors.
Whilst learners may be familiar with the roles of actor and designer, the
role of a director may need clarification. This clip is a useful starting
point: How Do You Become A Theatre Director? | Life in Stages
(youtube.com)
Learners should be made aware that the director oversees all decisions
from choosing the acting area, the performance style and how the
characters interact within the performance space, for example, how
proxemics are used to communicate relationships to an audience.
Teachers could ask learners to identify the performance style used in
this brief clip: THEATRE RE (UK) The Nature of Forgetting
(youtube.com).
In pairs learners could discuss why they think the director decided to
focus on movement as opposed to using dialogue.

Learning Experiences

Learners should be encouraged to consider the following learning experiences and skills to
further develop their understanding, appreciation and awareness of the subject content.
Information in the table below provides opportunities for teachers to integrate the learning
experiences into delivery.

experience a variety of
professional performance(s)
and/or workshops, either in
person or on-screen

3.1.1 how drama and theatre is designed, developed and
performed
•  Centres could develop opportunities to allow learners to
write their own scripts, for example, a young playwrights
competition, which could be embedded into the curriculum
at in years 7-10.

•  Learners are given the opportunity to write a brief script with
specific constraints, e.g. 2-4 characters, minimal staging.

•  6-8 scripts are chosen and the playwright is responsible for
directing, casting, rehearsals, etc. The rehearsal process is
overseen by the teachers and year 12 Drama learners who
are there simply to guide.

•  The final 6 performances are presented as an evening for

family and friends.

•  This process allows learners to understanding how plays are

developed, designed and performed.

•  Centres should utilise the wide range of contemporary
playwrights, directors and designers who are currently
working in Welsh theatre, for example:
•  Rachel Trezise, who has written several plays and has
worked extensively with the National Theatre Wales.

•  Kieran Bailey, who has worked as both an actor,

musical director and has just written his first musical set
in Wales.

•  Rich Tunley who has worked as a director and actor

with Black Rat Theatre Company.

•  Mathilde Lopez, who has worked as a freelance director
and worked extensively with National Theatre Wales.

•  Meeting a range of professionals who work in theatre
enables learners to gain knowledge of how plays are
constructed, developed and performed.

•  The Welsh Directory "Theatres and Theatre Companies" | Y
Lolfa, gives an extensive list of Welsh Companies and
theatres that centres could utilise to further develop learners
experience of theatre.

3.1.2 how the actor, designer and director communicate
meaning to an audience through the study of a set text
•

If centres are not studying Shakespeare, viewing a specific
scene, for example, the ‘Witches scene’ in Macbeth, from a
variety of different productions can help to inform learners
how plays can be interpreted in a variety of different ways.

•  Unit 3 is entitled ‘Interpreting theatre’ and learners should be
encouraged to develop their own interpretations of their
chosen set text.

•  The above exercise can also be linked to Section B for their

preparation of the unseen clip in the exam.

3.1.3 how to reflect on, analyse and evaluate the work of
others through the study of unprepared extracts:
•  The learner’s ability to reflect, analyse and evaluate the

work of others should initially be rooted in their own work
and the work of others in the group.

•  When reflecting on the work of others for the unseen text,
learners should be given specific guidance on the exact
area they are focusing on for example:
•  Vocal qualities (pace, accent, tone, pause, silence,

subtext), physical qualities (movement, body language,
posture, gesture, facial expression, gait)
•  Costume (period, style, fabric, colour, pattern,

appearance of costume, accessories).

•  Learners should also be given the relevant drama

terminology.

•

In the early stages of preparing learners for this element
they should be encouraged to discuss their ideas orally and
in groups. They should also be encouraged to keep a record
of their ideas, for example, developing a class theatre blog
of their reviews for specific clips.

•  Teachers should encourage learners to find their own
unseen clips of theatre and to explain to the rest of the
group why they think the performance/design elements are
effective/ineffective, etc.

•  Teachers should encourage learners to look online for
reviews of productions in publications for example: The
Stage, Guardian Reviews, to help develop their
understanding how productions are reviewed, and the
different elements reviewers focus on.

3.1.1 & 3.1.2
•  The chosen performance text could be divided into sections
and each group is responsible for developing their own
interpretation of a specific section. The members of the
group are responsible for designing, directing, performing
and producing the final product. The final performance is
filmed and each section from every group is assembled into
a complete film.

•  Each group presents a PowerPoint to the class outlining the
ideas, influences, why a specific stage type, colour, prop,
projection, style etc was chosen.

develop confidence in giving
and receiving feedback,
promoting independent
thinking, originality and
creative resilience

•  Unit 3 allows leaners to focus on how they and other theatre
makers interpret performance texts. For example, learners
are given a copy of the original stage directions from the
opening of ‘An Inspector Calls’ by J.B Priestly and this is
discussed, with learners focusing on the set design, etc.

•  Following this, the teacher then shows the group clips from
the 1992 production by Stephen Daldry An Inspector Calls |
UK Tour | ATG Tickets (youtube.com), and how he focused
on the themes of the play to revolutionise both the design of
the play and the overall production.

•  Throughout both the practical work and the written work
based on the set text, learners should be encouraged to
give oral and written feedback to each other. By allowing
learners to peer assess each other's written work based on
exam type questions, it will allow them to become familiar
with the mark scheme and will influence how they approach
both the lower and higher tariff questions.

be given opportunities to
take risks, use improvisation
and overcome creative
challenges

3.1.1
•  Learners should be encouraged to view a range of different
productions, both live and digitally, and record how both
design and performance ideas could be incorporated into
their own ideas for presenting the set text.

•  Learners should be confident in their understanding of the 4

main types of acting areas and how both design and
performance elements can be used to communicate
meaning to an audience. This understanding should be
clearly reflected in their written work.

collaborative performance

  GCSE Drama Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 30

3.1.1 & 3.1.2
•  To familiarise learners with their chosen text they could
present sections of it in a collaborative performance.
Learners could incorporate sections of the text,
improvisations, movement to music to highlight character,
plot and theme.

•  This is a work pack from WCMD to accompany their

production of Macbeth:
English: https://bit.ly/3SwI6oN
Welsh: https://bit.ly/3UAcJMN.

•  Learners could look at some of ideas within the pack and

create their own resource pack based on their chosen text,
for example:
Images of scenes and key lines linked to them.
•
•  Recorded video clips where learners describe a

character, their motivation and how they feel their motive
changes, which line of the play best represents a
character’s motivation and journey.

Gain a basic awareness of
ethical and legal
considerations as

3.1.3
•  Learners should be made aware of the seven protected

characteristics and how it is against the law to discriminate
against someone because of a protected characteristic.

•  Directors and casting directors need to be mindful of the
protected characteristics and the Equality Act 2010.

•  Learners could be given several clips with different actors

playing the same role, and discuss how each performance is
equally effective in communicating meaning to an audience.

3.1.2
•  Learners could look at the characters within their chosen
text and discuss which characters could be presented as
presented as a stereotype and how an actor/director could
avoid this in performance.

Opportunities for embedding elements of the Curriculum for Wales
Curriculum for Wales Strands

Cross-cutting Themes

There are many opportunities to include Local, National and International Contexts in GCSE Drama.
These opportunities are important to learners because Drama challenges them to consider their
cynefin and the possibilities they have to shape and impact the world in which they live. Through the
diverse study of play texts and theatre craft, learners are invited to embrace their own cultural heritage
as a means of positively contributing to the society in which they live.

writers, and/or to explore the work of theatre
makers both from Wales and from a range of
diverse backgrounds.

•  Centres have the freedom when considering the
design element for the set texts to set them in

•  All the set texts (except for A Glass Menagerie)
could be given a Welsh/local location which
learners could use as inspiration for their

Tuesday could be set in the learners' own
school.

This could help to give the learners ownership and
make the play more accessible for some learners.

•  Section B is the area where centres need to

ensure they are giving learners the opportunity
to view a range of theatre by a range of both
Welsh playwrights, actors and directors as well
as national and international.

Theatres in Wales have a rich archive of material
which centres can use to prepare learners for this
section, for example:
•  The Sherman Theatre - Past Productions |

Sherman Theatre.

This website offers clips of a range of productions
by Welsh Playwrights, actors and directors.

•  Theatre Clwyd
There are a range of short clips available which
would be suitable to explore for both acting and
design, for example:
https://www.theatrclwyd.com/take-
part/projects/together/theatre/mold-riots.

•  National Theatre Wales
Here you’ll find a range of material inspired by
locations, the people and history of Wales, for
example:
We're Still Here - educational resource

32

  GCSE Drama Unit 1 Guidance for Teaching 33

•  These companies create work which allow

learners the opportunity to explore a range of
techniques, forms, styles, genres, contexts and
means of presenting drama, for example,
learners could view a clip from ‘We’re Still Here’
and discuss how effective it was using a site-
specific location as opposed to setting it in a
theatre with a backdrop of the steel works.

•  Section B also allows centres to explore

work by international companies,
playwrights and directors, for example:
Woza Albert (youtube.com).

•  Although the clips are viewed from the focus of
acting and design, this section can provide
learners with the opportunity to explore a brief
background to specific plays.  For example,
‘Woza Albert’ written in 1981, is an important
South African anti-apartheid protest play.

•

It is envisaged that the range of work viewed in
Section B throughout the duration of class will
impact on the learner’s vision for their own work
and choices in Unit 1 and 2.

discuss with learners how this would impact on
design choices/ options for productions.

•  Learners could explore different design options

for their set text, for example, a detailed,
naturalistic set design and a minimalistic set
design, discussing which elements they
consider having the least environmental impact
and the reasons why.

Section A
•  All the set texts deal with relationships; learners
could explore whether some of the roles are
gender fluid, and whether changing the gender
of specific characters would change the focus of
the relationship or the playwright's intention.

•  They could use improvisation to explore short
extracts of the set text to experiment using
different genders for a specific character, and
whether that would impact on the relationship/
themes/message of the play.

•  This exercise could be reinforced by learners
viewing productions where the lead character
has been played by a different gender, for
example, Maxine Peake played the role of
Hamlet: Drama Online - Maxine Peakes Hamlet
(dramaonlinelibrary.com).

(This could be viewed and discussed as an option
for Section B.)

•  Learners could look at the similarities and
differences between each of the families.

•  Learners could explore whether these families
conform to the traditional concept of a family.

•  Learners could explore each of the characters in
their set text and analyse whether they are
presented as stereotypes or whether they are
three dimensional characters. As directors they
could give advice to the actor on how to avoid
the characters simply being presented as a
stereotype.

entail. For example what is the role of a sound
designer within a production, are they
freelance? How much do they earn? Learners
could further research these roles by looking at
job descriptions in publications like ‘The Stage’
and researching websites like:
https://www.associationofsounddesigners.com/

•  Guidance could also be given on the range of
roles involved in performance, for example,
what route would they take to become an actor/
lighting designer? The National Theatre website
has a range of short clips investigating what
each of the role's (actor, director & designer)
involve.

•  Whilst studying the set text it will also provide
opportunities to look at lesser-known roles

involved in a successful production, for
example, in ‘The Glass Menagerie’, Amanda
has a quick change in Scene 6.

•  When discussing how this could be achieved
could be an opportunity to look at roles like a
dresser: A Day in the Life of a Dresser | National
Theatre (youtube.com).

•  Whilst looking at the production work from

various companies in Section B, for example,
National Theatre Wales, learners could
investigate the range of roles involved in
company, such as the audience engagement
officer and Theatre Iolo’s education officer.
Many of these companies can be contacted and
will provide further information on these roles.

•  Unit 3 also provides the opportunity to discuss
other roles, for example, what route would a
learner explore if they wanted to become a
playwright, theatre critic or work in film or
television.

•  The arts also involve many opportunities for

learners who enjoy IT, for example, developing
digital backdrops or special effects for theatre.

Nb: Companies and past learners are often
delighted to visit centres and provide further
information about specific roles. Learners should
also be reminded that the skills learnt through the
study of Drama can have major impact on a range
of other jobs and career pathways.

watch a clip of previously unseen theatre, but also
listen. They will need to be able to identify areas like
tone and tempo and how the voice helps to
communicate the character at a specific moment
within the play.

•

Initially centres could introduce this task by focusing
on monologues: Greatest Acting Monologues Of All
Time PART 1 (youtube.com).  Although these
performances are from film clips it may provide a
pathway for learners to focus on, and listen to a
variety of vocal tones. Centres could then introduce
monologues from theatre, building up to theatre
performances involving two or more actors,
performing from a range of different performance
styles, for example: Musicals, comedies, tragedies
etc (Centres should note in the final exam learners
will be given a clip from a theatre production).

(there is a wide selection on BBC Sounds). They
could analyse and evaluate how actors use vocal
techniques to create a character, relationships, mood,

location, etc. They could also analyse and evaluate
how and why sound effects are used. This exercise
could then be adapted, for example: Partners/groups
choose a short extract from their set text and record
it. They could then listen back to the recording and
discuss whether their vocal choices are effective.

•  Learners should be given the opportunity to research
and listen to a variety of music/sound effects. They
could create a playlist deciding where and why
specific effects should be played within their set text
and to what effect.

•  When discussing their ideas/concept for the design

option in Section A, learners should listen to a variety
of creative ideas.

•  When reading their set text in class or preparing short

extracts for practical work, learners should be
encouraged to look carefully at the structure of the
dialogue, for example, how the playwright uses
punctuation, the length of the sentence, why has the
playwright included a pause to break up the
dialogue?

•  These observations can be linked to practical

activities, for example, learners move around the
space reading a speech from one of the characters
and each time the playwright uses punctuation, they
have to change direction. This is a useful exercise to
make learners aware of the importance of
punctuation within a play.

•  Learners should be encouraged to read a range of

plays beyond the one they are studying for Unit 3. It
is useful for departments to create a small library of
plays by influential playwrights, for example, ‘Top
Girls’ by Caryl Churchill, or plays by Debbie Tucker
Green, to allow learners to discover the different ways
playwrights use and structure dialogue.

•

‘Cutting It’ by Charlene James, which deals with FGM
and ,For Black Boys Who Have Considered Suicide
When the Hue Gets too Heavy” which deals with
contemporary issues of race. Plays dealing with
contemporary issues allow learners to consider the
wider purpose of theatre beyond simply entertaining
an audience. Encouraging learners to broaden their
reading of plays will not only develop their
understanding of the structure of plays for Unit 3 but
will provide them with greater creative choices for
Unit 1 and 2.

•  Learners should be given every opportunity to look at
past papers and the type of questions that could be
asked. Centres need to encourage learners to read
the questions carefully and to focus on the exact
information the question is asking for.

•  By exploring Unit 3 of the course practically, learners
will be given numerous opportunities to speak. This
could take place through improvisations based on the
set text or by performing short extracts. The practical
work should always be consolidated by questioning
learners on why specific performance choices were
made or allowing them to give verbal feedback on the
work of others.

•  Learners should also be encouraged to present their
views verbally in a more formalised way, for example,
in pairs, learners present a design concept for a
specific extract. This is delivered to the group. The
presentation should focus on style/concept, acting
area, location, set/props, colour, texture, lighting and
sound/music. They should focus on clear reasons
explaining why they have made these design
choices.

•  Section B will require learners to focus on specific
areas and to discuss and explain their ideas based
on what they have viewed. From the beginning of the
course, it is imperative that all learners are
encouraged to develop the confidence to express
their views. Encourage learners from an early stage
to research a clip from a theatre production with a
specific focus: acting, design or directing.

•  Learners show the clip and discuss why they thought
the area of focus was effective/ineffective and explain
which elements made it effective/ineffective. They
should also be encouraged to answers questions

presentations. All of these activities however, should
lead to a greater understanding for learners of the
final written exam.

It is important for practical activities to have a specific
focus linked to exam questions, for example, learners
are given a specific scene and decide on two props a
character/s that could be used in the scene. Once
they have practically explored the scene, they could
be verbally questioned;
•  What is a prop?
•  Describe the props you have used?
•  How did the characters use the prop in scene?

Writing

•  Once discussed they could write down their

responses. As a plenary at the end of a practical
lesson, learners could be given a brief written
exercise involving lower tariff type questions.
Learners could be encouraged to keep an informal
record of their ideas throughout the duration of the
course, recording their range of ideas.

•  Throughout the duration of the course learners

should be given a range of questions based on past
papers, current SAMS to consolidate their

understanding of questions and to recognise the
importance of timing.

•  As with Section A, approaches to Section B could

initially be approached orally, however, learners need
to familiarise themselves with the type of questions
that will be asked in the exam (see SAMS).

•  Centres should begin by focusing on one question

and guiding learners through the type of information
they will be required to give.

•  Centres should ensure that learners are given a list of
key Drama terminology which should be used in both
sections of the exam.

which would provide an opportunity for further
investigation, for example, breakdown of the family unit
(The Glass Menagerie), animal experimentation
(Lionboy), peer pressure (Resting Restless), Bullying
(Blue Remembered Hills), Car Theft amongst
adolescents (Face).

•

In pairs they could identify some key questions linked to
a theme which would allow them to research statistical
evidence. An example of this could be:
•  Animal experimentation: What percentage of

experiments were carried out on animals in 2000?
What percentage of experiments on animals were
carried out in 2023? What was the percentage
difference? In 2022 how many animals were
experimented on? What percentage of this number
were mice, how many were primates? How many
were pigs? What is the difference between
government money spent on new projects focused on
developing or improving non –animal alternatives and

how much public money goes into funding animal
experimentation?

•  Once the learners have gathered the relevant statistical
information they could use it in a variety of ways, for
example, in class improvisations to enhance their
understanding of both character/theme.

•  They could write a monologue from the point of a

company CEO, using the data to explain why animal
experimentation is vital to the advancement of medicine.
The other monologue could be written from Magdalen’s
point of view using the data to explain why animal
experimentation is both cruel and unnecessary. The
group then votes, based on the statical evidence
presented by both characters, which viewpoint is the
most convincing.

•

In groups they could produce a short play or film based
on the statistical evidence they have gathered. The
performance could look at both for/against animal
experimentation based on the gathered statical evidence.
The play could involve music, dance, mime, etc (Nb: This
could have opportunities for further development for Unit
1 work).

•  The collected data could be used as part of a set design,
for example: The chosen style could be Epic theatre, for
specific themes, learners could decide to use a
PowerPoint displaying key statistics to juxtapose the
action/characters within the scene.

In pairs, learners are given one of the following
performance styles to investigate; Musical Theatre,
Physical Theatre, Theatre in Education or Naturalism.

•  They will be given a set of questions to investigate

audience engagement/attendance based on different
styles of theatre, for example: What percentage of 15–
25-year-olds attended the theatre in 2023?

•  Learners could look at the different age brackets and
investigate which age bracket was more/less likely to
attend a theatrical performance. Learners could also look
at the following examples:
•  What percentage of people from different ethnic
backgrounds attended theatre performances?

•  What is the percentage of people in different
socio/economic brackets who attend theatre
productions?

•  What is the percentage of different genders (including
non-binary, transgender, etc) who attend theatre
productions?

•  Which performance style appeals to the greatest

percentage of an audience?

•  Based on their statistical research, learners present their
findings to the group, giving reasons based on the data
and their investigations on the conclusions they have
drawn from the data.

understanding the difficulties some actors have
overcome, for example,
•

‘Housemates’ by Tim Green/Hijinx Theatre
Company/Sherman Theatre.

•  Taking Flight Theatre – Innovative and

accessible theatre from Wales.

•  Cuttin' It | Interview with cast, Adelayo Adedayo

•  Much of the learner's success in Unit 3 will be based on
knowledge and understanding but will also be firmly
based on their ability to look at specific areas, for
example, looking at design from a creative and innovative
viewpoint.

•  The more theatrical influences that learners are exposed
to the greater impact it will have on their own creative
thinking. Learners should be encouraged to see as many
live performances as possible from school-based
‘Theatre in Education’ to large scale musicals. As for
many learners, the cost of going to theatre is prohibitive,
schools can apply for grants Go and See | Arts Council of
Wales to help with the cost of tickets and travel. Centres
are also encouraged to use NT live, digital theatre and
the wide range of theatre clips which are available.

•  Learners should be encouraged to keep a record of ideas
for design/performances they think could influence the
design ideas for their chosen set text.

•  Many professional companies, such as Splendid

Productions – High performance theatre, will tailor make

option may prove expensive, colleges such as the Welsh
College of Music and Drama, have a range of
productions, resources and workshops which learners
could use.

•  Many theatre practitioners will be prepared to do a Zoom

meeting with a class to discuss a specific area of
design/performance.

There are many opportunities to include Critical Thinking and Problem Solving in GCSE Drama.
These opportunities are important to Learners because it is only through this means of approach
that their artistry can remain altruistic in outcome.
