## <span id="page-4-0"></span>About this pack: information for teachers

This pack contains the assessment materials for Unit 2: Performance from a Text

Within this pack, you will find:

- information for teachers on how to manage arrangements for assessment
- a **candidate pack** which includes:
  - details of the assignment
  - a detailed breakdown of each task
  - information for candidates, which tells candidates about things that they must and must not do when they are completing the assessment
  - a Candidate Cover Sheet
  - a Candidate Declaration Form
  - a Candidate Time Record sheet.

**You must provide each candidate with a copy of the complete candidate assessment pack.**

## <span id="page-4-1"></span>Managing the assessment

This is a WJEC marked (external) non-examination assessment. The following arrangements must be followed when managing the assessment.

Learners will have free choice of text for Unit 2, however, the choice of text must be different to the set text selected in Unit 3.

Learners may choose to complete this unit as actors **or** designers, regardless of their chosen pathway in Unit 1.

Learners choosing design must choose **one** of the following options:

- lighting design
- sound design
- set and props design
- costume, hair and make-up design.

#### **Task setting**

This assignment has been produced by WJEC and cannot be changed

#### **Time**

The length of this piece of theatre will depend on the number of actors in the group and should be as follows:

• Group of two actors: 5-10 minutes • Group of three actors: 7-12 minutes • Group of four actors: 9-14 minutes

Each actor must interact with other actors and/or the audience **for a minimum of five minutes**. The number of designers in a group does not impact on the length of the piece. A piece of theatre or individual performance which is significantly below the recommended minimum performance length will be unlikely to demonstrate evidence of the skills required to access marks in the higher bands of the assessment criteria.

{5}------------------------------------------------

**Designers** must contribute fully to both the creation and performance of the piece of theatre.

#### **Viva (designers only)**

All **designers** must give a 3–5-minute non assessed presentation of their design to the examiner. This viva will occur after the performance and can be presented in any format e.g. PowerPoint, oral presentation. The non-assessed viva is an opportunity for learners to explain and present their design to the examiner.

The following evidence could be included to support the presentation:

#### Lighting design:

• cue sheets

#### Sound design:

• cue sheets

Set design and props design:

• a model set. The model may be presented in a digital format.

Costume design, hair and make-up design:

• sketches of both costume, hair and make-up designs

#### **Resources**

Candidates must have access to the candidate assessment pack and any necessary resources, as specified in the detailed task tables within the candidate pack.

#### **Collaboration**

Learners must work in groups of between **two** and **four** actors. Each group may have up to **two** designers, each offering a different design skill.

All learners must contribute fully to the development and creation of the piece of theatre. Performance pieces must therefore be carefully selected to ensure that all learners are able to fully demonstrate their chosen skill.

Centres should also ensure safe working practices for all learners.

Centres should note that it is not necessary for all learners in the teaching group to choose an extract(s) from the same performance text.

#### **Supervision**

- No formal supervision.
- There is no restriction on the amount of time learners spend on exploring, creating and developing their performance/design from a published performance piece.
- Teachers may provide guidance and support to learners to ensure that they have a clear understanding of the requirements for example the assessment grid.

{6}------------------------------------------------

- Once the creating and developing work is underway, feedback must be limited to general advice on what needs to be improved. Teachers must **not** provide specific guidance on how to achieve these improvements.
- Teachers must see learners' ideas in progress at least three times at different stages during the process to be able to authenticate the work as the learner's own and complete the necessary authentication documentation.

#### **Authentication**

Candidates must sign the declaration to confirm that all evidence submitted for moderation is their own work and that any sources used have been acknowledged.

Assessors must sign the declaration to confirm that evidence submitted for moderation was completed under the controlled conditions set out in this assessment.

#### **Candidate evidence**

The teacher **must** be present for all performances and design vivas, so that the work can be authenticated.

All performances and design vivas must be audio-visually recorded by the centre and submitted to WJEC within two weeks of the performance date.

All learners (including design learners) must be clearly identified by name and candidate number at the start of each group performance.

The recording must be of all the performances (with learners clearly identified at the start of each) which have been assessed live by the visiting examiner.

The recording of each piece must be the complete, unedited performance filmed from the audience perspective.

#### **Task marking**

WJEC will mark all evidence produced by candidates.

Centres **must** ensure that a candidate cover sheet (included in the candidate assessment pack) is completed for every candidate and attached to the front of the candidate's work.

Centres **must** ensure that candidates complete a candidate declaration form; these are included in the candidate assessment pack.

#### **Further information**

You should refer to the JCQ Instructions for conducting non-examination assessment for further information on managing assessment within our GCSE/Applied Qualifications.

{7}------------------------------------------------

## <span id="page-7-0"></span>Assessment Details

Learners are required to:

- create and develop an extract from a published performance text for performance
- demonstrate and apply their performance **or** design skills in a live performance.

#### Learners can:

• choose to be assessed as actors **or** designers.

The unit will be externally assessed by a visiting examiner anytime between January and May of the final year of the qualification.

Work which falls under the time limit will not be penalised. However, centres and learners should note that work which is significantly short is unlikely to be awarded in the higher mark bands as there may not be enough evidence of development and/or engagement with the audience.

Work which exceeds the time limit will not be penalised. However, centres and learners should note that only work which falls within the maximum timings specified on page 44 will be assessed.

The appropriate band will be established by determining which performance descriptor best reflects the learner's performance.

The appropriate mark will then be established by determining the extent to which the learner has met the criteria within the relevant band **–** completely met (upper part of band), mostly met (middle of band), partially met (lower part of band).

The total marks for all 4 columns may reflect performance at different bands across the assessment objectives, for example, a learner may achieve band 4 for column 1 and band 5 for column 2.

It should be noted that the bands have been designed to assist the marking process by identifying individual levels of achievement and they do not correlate with grade boundaries.

#### **Guidance for Assessment**

There are assessment grids for the different options available:

- performance
- lighting design
- sound design
- set and props design
- costume, hair and make-up design.

There are 4 columns in each grid.

Column 1 within each grid assess AO4:

• learners' ability to create and develop ideas to communicate meaning.

Columns 2, 3 and 4 in each grid assess AO2:

- application of performance **or** design skills
- interpretation of character(s) **or** extract(s) and audience engagement
- contribution to the performance.

{8}------------------------------------------------

#### **Column 1 – Creating and developing ideas (AO4)**

When assessing AO4, examiners will consider how the creation and development of ideas are evidenced within the final performance/design. They will assess the extent to which the final performance/design has been rehearsed and refined and demonstrates a holistic understanding of how meaning is communicated to an audience.

The following table explains in detail how to assess each bullet point on the assessment grid for AO4:

|                                                                  | Assessment grid                                                                                             | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| For all learners, consideration should be given to: | <ul><li>how ideas have been developed to create a piece of theatre from a published performance text.</li></ul> | <ul><li>assess to what extent the learner has developed a coherent and refined piece of theatre.</li></ul> |
|  | <ul><li>the selection of dramatic conventions and/or techniques and how they communicate meaning.</li></ul> | <ul><li>assess the effectiveness of the use of dramatic conventions and/or techniques to communicate meaning.

{9}------------------------------------------------

#### **Column 2 – Application of performance/design skills (AO2)**

This assessment objective is assessed through the realisation of the final performance **or** design.

When assessing the application of skills, examiners will consider how well the learner has applied performance **or** design skills within the final piece.

For actors, consideration should be given to:

- i) the application of appropriate physical skills, including:
  - gesture
  - stillness
  - fluency
  - expression
  - posture
  - facial expression
  - movement
  - proxemics.
- ii) the application of appropriate vocal skills, including:
  - pitch
  - pace/tempo
  - pause
  - accent
  - volume
  - clarity.
- iii) the appropriateness of the interaction with other actors, including:
  - fluency of cues
  - eye contact
  - listening and responding
  - pace and fluency of performance
  - interaction with audience (where appropriate and relevant)
  - interaction with set/props/costume (where appropriate and relevant).

For designers, consideration should be given to:

- iv) the application of design skills and the degree to which they facilitate the action within the performance.
- v) the application of design resources within the piece, including the appropriate use of for example:

#### **(lighting designers)**

- intensity
- focus
- angle
- specials/gobos
- projections
- colour
- types of lantern
- positioning of lighting source
- fluency of cues

{10}------------------------------------------------

#### **(sound designers)**

- music
- sound effects
- live sounds
- recorded sounds
- volume
- reverb/echo
- sound sources
- amplification including use of microphones
- positioning of sound sources on stage
- fluency of cues.

#### **(set and props designers)**

- the performance space and the placement of set and props
- backdrop/cyclorama
- wings/flats
- set dressing
- props
- furniture
- projection
- colour
- texture/fabrics
- entrances and exits
- sight lines.

## **(costume, hair and make-up designers)**

- materials/fabrics
- garments
- hairstyles
- wigs
- make-up
- accessories
- colour/pattern.

#### **Column 3 – Interpretation of character(s)/extract(s) and audience engagement (AO2)**

This assessment objective is assessed through the realisation of the final performance **or**  design.

Actors: When assessing the interpretation of character examiners will consider how well the learner has communicated the character in performance. Was the character(s) motivations/status/relationships clear? Was the characterisation engaging?

Designers: When assessing the interpretation of the extract(s) (designers) examiners will consider how well the learner has communicated the piece in design. Was there a sense of location/atmosphere/status/ evident within the design? Was this sustained throughout the performance? Were there effective subtleties in design?

{11}------------------------------------------------

#### **Column 4 – Contribution to the performance (AO2)**

This assessment objective is assessed through the realisation of the final performance **or**  design.

When assessing the contribution to the performance examiners will consider how well the individual performance **or** design contributed to the success of the final performance.

For actors, consideration will be given to:

- the energy and focus displayed
- confidence on stage
- performance time on stage.

For designers, consideration will be given to:

- how the design communicated atmosphere
- how the design enhanced the performance

how the design enhanced the audience's understanding and theatrical experience.

## About this pack: information and instructions for candidates

This candidate assessment pack is for candidates completing Unit 2–Performance from a Text.

Within this pack, you will find:

- your assignment
- a detailed breakdown of each task, the evidence requirements, and the conditions (controls) under which the task is to be completed
- information for candidates, which tells you about things that you must and must not do when you are completing the assessment
- the mark scheme which will be used to assess your work
- a Candidate cover sheet
- a Declaration Form.

The length of this piece of theatre will depend on the number of actors in your group and should be as follows:

• Group of two actors: 5-10 minutes • Group of three actors: 7-12 minutes • Group of four actors: 9-14 minutes

Each actor must interact with other actors and/or the audience **for a minimum of five minutes**. The number of designers in a group does not impact on the length of the piece.

**All learners** must contribute fully to both the creation and performance of the piece of theatre.

#### Supervision

• There is no formal supervision required by your teacher during the exploring, creating and developing process.

#### Monitoring

- There is no restriction on the amount of time you can spend on exploring, creating and developing your devised performance.
- Teachers may provide guidance and support to you to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the requirements.
- Once the creating and developing work is underway, feedback must be limited to general advice on what needs to be improved. Teachers must **not** provide specific guidance on how to achieve these improvements.
- Teachers must see your ideas in progress at least three times at different stages during the process to be able to authenticate the work as your own and complete the necessary authentication documentation.

You and your teacher will be required to sign a declaration that all work presented is your own work.

{20}------------------------------------------------

## Assessment: Performance for a Text

You are required to:

- create and develop an extract from a published performance text for performance
- demonstrate and apply your performance **or** design skills in a live performance.

#### You can:

• choose to be assessed as actors **or** designers.

#### Viva (designers only)

If you have chosen **design,** you must give a 3–5-minute presentation of your design to the examiner. This viva will not be assessed and will take place after the performance. You can present the viva in any format e.g. PowerPoint, oral presentation. This is an opportunity for you to explain and present your design to the examiner.

The following evidence could be included to support your viva presentation:

#### Lighting design:

• cue sheets

#### Sound design:

• cue sheets

Set design and props design:

• a model set. The model may be presented in a digital format.

Costume design, hair and make-up design:

• sketches of both costume, hair and make-up designs.

#### Group Arrangements

You must work in groups of between **two** and **four** actors. Each group may have up to **two** designers, each offering a different design skill.

If you have chosen to work as a designer, you must contribute fully to the creation of the piece of theatre alongside the actors.

## Information for candidates

The following information has been taken from the [JCQ Information for candidates](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) – non[examination assessments](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) and the [JCQ Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) Use in Assessments:](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/)  [Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/) This tells you about things that you **must** and **must not** do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not understand, you **must** ask your teacher.

#### **Preparing your work**

- When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you need to ensure that your final product reflects your own independent work and isn't copied or paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
- If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you **must** tell your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
- If you worked as part of a group on a task, you **must** each write up your own account of the assignment. Even if the data you have is the same, you **must** describe in your own words how that data was obtained, and you **must** independently draw your own conclusions from the data.
- Take care of your work and keep it safe. **Do not** leave it lying around where your classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You **must** always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; **do not** share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
- **Do not** be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI tools and chatbots) – this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort of copying.
- You **must not** write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

## **Plagiarism**

Plagiarism involves taking someone else's words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them off as your own. **It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously.** Don't think you won't be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:

- Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
- Markers are highly experienced subject specialists they may have read the source you are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!
- Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and style of writing or punctuation.

#### **Penalties for breaking the regulations**

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be applied:

- the piece of work will be awarded zero marks
- you will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question
- you will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series
- you will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

**Remember – it's your qualification so it needs to be your own work.**
