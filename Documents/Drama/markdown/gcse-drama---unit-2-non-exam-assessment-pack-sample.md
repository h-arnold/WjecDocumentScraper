## About this pack: information for teachers

This pack contains the assessment materials for Unit 2: Performance from a Text

## Within this pack, you will find:

- information for teachers on how to manage arrangements for assessment
- a candidate pack which includes:
- details of the assignment
- a detailed breakdown of each task
- information for candidates, which tells candidates about things that they must and must not do when they are completing the assessment
- a Candidate Cover Sheet
- a Candidate Declaration Form
- a Candidate Time Record sheet.

You must provide each candidate with a copy of the complete candidate assessment pack.

## Managing the assessment

This is a WJEC marked (external) non-examination assessment. The following arrangements must be followed when managing the assessment.

Learners will have free choice of text for Unit 2, however, the choice of text must be different to the set text selected in Unit 3.

Learners may choose to complete this unit as actors or designers, regardless of their chosen pathway in Unit 1.

Learners choosing design must choose one of the following options:

- lighting design
- sound design
- set and props design
- costume, hair and make-up design.

## Task setting

This assignment has been produced by WJEC and cannot be changed

## Time

The length of this piece of theatre will depend on the number of actors in the group and should be as follows:

- Group of two actors:

5-10 minutes

- Group of three actors:

7-12 minutes

- Group of four actors:

9-14 minutes

Each actor must interact with other actors and/or the audience for a minimum of five minutes . The number of designers in a group does not impact on the length of the piece. A piece of theatre or individual performance which is significantly below the recommended minimum performance length will be unlikely to demonstrate evidence of the skills required to access marks in the higher bands of the assessment criteria.

<!-- image -->



{6}------------------------------------------------



Designers must contribute fully to both the creation and performance of the piece of theatre.

## Viva (designers only)

All designers must give a 3 -5-minute non assessed presentation of their design to the examiner. This viva will occur after the performance and can be presented in any format e.g. PowerPoint, oral presentation. The non-assessed viva is an opportunity for learners to explain and present their design to the examiner.

The following evidence could be included to support the presentation:

Lighting design:

- cue sheets

Sound design:

- cue sheets

Set design and props design:

- a model set. The model may be presented in a digital format.

Costume design, hair and make-up design:

- sketches of both costume, hair and make-up designs

## Resources

Candidates must have access to the candidate assessment pack and any necessary resources, as specified in the detailed task tables within the candidate pack.

## Collaboration

Learners must work in groups of between two and four actors. Each group may have up to two designers, each offering a different design skill.

All learners must contribute fully to the development and creation of the piece of theatre. Performance pieces must therefore be carefully selected to ensure that all learners are able to fully demonstrate their chosen skill.

Centres should also ensure safe working practices for all learners.

Centres should note that it is not necessary for all learners in the teaching group to choose an extract(s) from the same performance text.

## Supervision

- No formal supervision.
- There is no restriction on the amount of time learners spend on exploring, creating and developing their performance/design from a published performance piece.
- Teachers may provide guidance and support to learners to ensure that they have a clear understanding of the requirements for example the assessment grid.



{7}------------------------------------------------



- Once the creating and developing work is underway, feedback must be limited to general advice on what needs to be improved. Teachers must not provide specific guidance on how to achieve these improvements.
- Teachers must see learners' ideas in progress at least three times at different stages during the process to be able to authenticate the work as the learner's own and complete the necessary authentication documentation.

## Authentication

Candidates must sign the declaration to confirm that all evidence submitted for moderation is their own work and that any sources used have been acknowledged.

Assessors must sign the declaration to confirm that evidence submitted for moderation was completed under the controlled conditions set out in this assessment.

## Candidate evidence

The teacher must be present for all performances and design vivas, so that the work can be authenticated.

All performances and design vivas must be audio-visually recorded by the centre and submitted to WJEC within two weeks of the performance date.

All learners (including design learners) must be clearly identified by name and candidate number at the start of each group performance.

The recording must be of all the performances (with learners clearly identified at the start of each) which have been assessed live by the visiting examiner.

The recording of each piece must be the complete, unedited performance filmed from the audience perspective.

## Task marking

WJEC will mark all evidence produced by candidates.

Centres must ensure that a candidate cover sheet (included in the candidate assessment pack) is completed for every candidate and attached to the front of the candidate's work.

Centres must ensure that candidates complete a candidate declaration form; these are included in the candidate assessment pack.

## Further information

You should refer to the JCQ Instructions for conducting non-examination assessment for further information on managing assessment within our GCSE/Applied Qualifications.



{8}------------------------------------------------



## Assessment Details

Learners are required to:

- create and develop an extract from a published performance text for performance
- demonstrate and apply their performance or design skills in a live performance.

## Learners can:

- choose to be assessed as actors or designers.

The unit will be externally assessed by a visiting examiner anytime between January and May of the final year of the qualification.

<!-- image -->

Work which falls under the time limit will not be penalised. However, centres and learners should note that work which is significantly short is unlikely to be awarded in the higher mark bands as there may not be enough evidence of development and/or engagement with the audience.

Work which exceeds the time limit will not be penalised. However, centres and learners should note that only work which falls within the maximum timings specified on page 44 will be assessed.

The appropriate band will be established by determining which performance descriptor best reflects the learner's performance.

The appropriate mark will then be established by determining the extent to which the learner has met the criteria within the relevant band -completely met (upper part of band), mostly met (middle of band), partially met (lower part of band).

The total marks for all 4 columns may reflect performance at different bands across the assessment objectives, for example, a learner may achieve band 4 for column 1 and band 5 for column 2.

It should be noted that the bands have been designed to assist the marking process by identifying individual levels of achievement and they do not correlate with grade boundaries.

## Guidance for Assessment

There are assessment grids for the different options available:

- performance
- lighting design
- sound design
- set and props design
- costume, hair and make-up design.
- There are 4 columns in each grid.

Column 1 within each grid assess AO4:

- learners' ability to create and develop ideas to communicate meaning.

Columns 2, 3 and 4 in each grid assess AO2:

- application of performance or design skills
- interpretation of character(s) or extract(s) and audience engagement
- contribution to the performance.



{9}------------------------------------------------



## Column 1 -Creating and developing ideas (AO4)

When assessing AO4, examiners will consider how the creation and development of ideas are evidenced within the final performance/design. They will assess the extent to which the final performance/design has been rehearsed and refined and demonstrates a holistic understanding of how meaning is communicated to an audience.

The following table explains in detail how to assess each bullet point on the assessment grid for AO4:

|                                                      | Assessment grid                                                                                 | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| For all learners, consideration should be given to:  | • how ideas have been developed to create a piece of theatre from a published performance text. | • assess to what extent the learner has developed a coherent and refined piece of theatre.                                                                                                                                                                    |
|                                                      | • the selection of dramatic conventions and/or techniques and how they communicate meaning.     | • assess the effectiveness of the use of dramatic conventions and/or techniques to communicate meaning. Conventions or techniques could be linked to specific practitioners/companies/genres or the intended performance conditions of the chosen extract(s). |
| For actors only consideration should be given to:    | • how the performance space is planned to communicate meaning.                                  | • assess the learner's use of the performance space, including entrances/exits, levels, proxemics, audience position to communicate meaning in performance.                                                                                                   |
| For designers only consideration should be given to: | • how the design is planned to communicate meaning.                                             | • assess how well the design has been planned to communicate meaning in performance.                                                                                                                                                                          |



{10}------------------------------------------------



## Column 2 -Application of performance/design skills (AO2)

This assessment objective is assessed through the realisation of the final performance or design.

- interaction with set/props/costume (where appropriate and relevant).

For designers, consideration should be given to:

- iv)  the application of design skills and the degree to which they facilitate the action within the performance.
- v) the application of design resources within the piece, including the appropriate use of for example:

## (lighting designers)

- intensity
- focus
- angle
- specials/gobos

## Column 3 -Interpretation of character(s)/extract(s) and audience engagement (AO2)

This assessment objective is assessed through the realisation of the final performance or design.

Actors: When assessing the interpretation of character examiners will consider how well the learner has communicated the character in performance. Was the character(s) motivations/status/relationships clear? Was the characterisation engaging?

Designers: When assessing the interpretation of the extract(s) (designers) examiners will consider how well the learner has communicated the piece in design. Was there a sense of location/atmosphere/status/ evident within the design? Was this sustained throughout the performance? Were there effective subtleties in design?



{12}------------------------------------------------



## Column 4 -Contribution to the performance (AO2)

This assessment objective is assessed through the realisation of the final performance or design.

When assessing the contribution to the performance examiners will consider how well the individual performance or design contributed to the success of the final performance.

For actors, consideration will be given to:

- the energy and focus displayed
- confidence on stage
- performance time on stage.

For designers, consideration will be given to:

- how the design communicated atmosphere
- how the design enhanced the performance

how the design enhanced the audience's understanding and theatrical experience.

## Information for candidates

The following information has been taken from the JCQ Information for candidates -nonexamination assessments and the JCQ Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use in Assessments: Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications. This tells you about things that you must and must not do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not understand, you must ask your teacher.

## Preparing your work

- When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you need to ensure that your final product reflects your own independent work and isn't copied or paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
- If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you must tell your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
- If you worked as part of a group on a task, you must each write up your own account of the assignment. Even if the data you have is the same, you must describe in your own words how that data was obtained, and you must independently draw your own conclusions from the data.
- Take care of your work and keep it safe. Do not leave it lying around where your classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You must always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; do not share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
- Do not be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI tools and chatbots) -this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort of copying.
- You must not write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

## Plagiarism

Plagiarism involves taking someone else's words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them off as your own. It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously. Don't think you won't be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:

- Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
- Markers are highly experienced subject specialists -they may have read the source you are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!
- Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and style of writing or punctuation.

## Penalties for breaking the regulations

- If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be applied:
- the piece of work will be awarded zero marks
- you will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question
- you will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series
- you will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.
