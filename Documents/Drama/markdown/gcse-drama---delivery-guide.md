## Aims of the Delivery Guide

The aim of the Delivery Guide is to give an overview of the qualification and to help teachers understand how we assess the GCSE. It will offer an introduction to the specification, an assessment overview, and will support teachers in better understanding how to prepare their learners for the assessment of the different units. More information on each unit can be found in the separate unit guides.

{5}------------------------------------------------



This unit will focus on:

- exploring - learners will have the opportunity to explore a range of theatrical practitioners/companies/styles and genres. This will include a range of techniques, forms, styles, contexts and means of presenting drama. Exploration could also be through the means of live and/or digital theatre, as possible sources of influence for performance or design ideas. Learners should have the opportunity to explore diversity, including different perspectives, identity, culture, and contributions that span Wales and the world.
- responding and reflecting - learners will be able to reflect on their own work and respond to the feedback from others as an on-going process throughout the development period, allowing them to improve in the performances they give or in the designs they create
- creating - learners will contribute to the creation of a devised performance in response to a choice of stimuli set by WJEC.

Learners may choose to complete this unit as actors or designers, regardless of their chosen pathway in Unit 2.

Learners choosing design must choose one

- lighting design
- sound design
- set and props design
- costume, hair and make-up design.

For this assessment learners are required to:

- create and develop a piece of theatre in response to a stimulus, using either the techniques of an influential theatre practitioner, company or the characteristics of a theatrical style or genre and demonstrate and apply their performance or design skills in a live performance
- produce a reflective log.

Learners can choose to be assessed on either acting or design.

Learners can work in groups of between two and five actors. Each group may have up to four designers, each offering a different design skill.

The length of this piece of theatre will depend on the number of actors in the group and should be as follows:

- •

- Group of two actors: 5-10 minutes

- •

- Group of three actors: 7-12 minutes

- •

- Group of four actors: 9-14 minutes

- •

- Group of five actors: 11-16 minutes.

of the following options:



{6}------------------------------------------------



Each actor must interact with other actors and/or the audience for a minimum of five minutes . The number of designers in a group does not impact on the length of the piece. Learners may complete the assessment anytime during the course. However, centres should ensure that assessment is completed only when learners have undertaken the necessary teaching and learning and developed the required skills and knowledge.

The assessment contributes to 40% of the overall qualification. The unit will be marked out of total of 96 marks.

The stimuli will be released on WJEC's portal during the September of the first year of study.

This unit will be assessed by the centre and externally moderated by WJEC.



{7}------------------------------------------------



## Unit 2

## Performance from a Text

Practical non-examination assessment Marked by a visiting examiner 30% of qualification 72 marks

## Overview of unit

The purpose of this unit is to:

- develop learners' awareness and skills regarding the development, amendment and refinement of their own text-based performance or design
- develop learners' application of performance or design skills within a live performance.

This unit will focus on:

- exploring - learners will have the opportunity to explore and perform a range of theatrical texts, from various genres and periods and linked to different cultures, perspectives and contributions in Wales and the world. Exploration could also be linked to a range of theatrical styles and genres, to various practitioner/theatre companies' artistic aims and through the means of live and/or digital theatre, as a possible source of influence for performance or design ideas
- creating - linked to the process of creating and the realisation of the final text-based performance and could be experienced as actors or designers.

Learners will have free choice of text for Unit 2, however, the choice of text must be different to the set text selected in Unit 3.

Learners may choose to complete this unit as actors or designers, regardless of their chosen pathway in Unit 1.

Learners choosing design must choose one of the following options:

- lighting design
- sound design
- set and props design
- costume, hair and make-up design.

For this assessment learners are required to:

- create and develop an extract(s) from a published performance text for performance
- demonstrate and apply performance or design skills that will be realised in the final performance .

Learners will have free choice of text for Unit 2, however, the choice of text must be different to the set text selected in Unit 3.

Learners can choose to be assessed on either acting or design.

Learners work in groups of between two and four actors. Each group may have up to two designers, each offering a different design skill.



{8}------------------------------------------------



The length of this piece of theatre will depend on the number of actors in the group and should be as follows:

- Group of two actors:

5-10 minutes

- •

- Group of three actors:

7-12 minutes

- •

- Group of four actors: 9-14 minutes

Each actor must interact with other actors and/or the audience for a minimum of five minutes . The number of designers in a group does not impact on the length of the piece.

## Viva

The viva is non-assessed and will occur after the performance. All learners opting for design must give a 3-5 minute presentation of their design to the examiner. It is an opportunity for learners to explain and present their design to the examiner.

This unit will be completed in the final year of study.

The assessment contributes to 30% of the overall qualification. The unit will be marked out of total of 72 marks.

This unit will be assessed by a visiting examiner.



{9}------------------------------------------------



## Unit 3

## Interpreting Theatre

Digital only examination, marked by WJEC 30% of qualification 72 marks

## Overview of unit

The purpose of this unit is to:

- demonstrate and apply knowledge and understanding of how drama is designed, developed and performed through the context of prepared and unprepared works
- develop learners' creative skills as an actor, designer and director through the context of prepared and unprepared works
- reflect on and analyse the work of others through the context of unprepared work.

This unit will focus on:

- exploring - learners will have the opportunity to explore various theatrical viewpoints and experiences. This should include a range of techniques, forms, styles and contexts. This exploration will be linked to their chosen set text as well as a range of theatrical productions of contrasting styles/genres, contrasting periods/contexts, works created in or inspired by Wales and works written by a diverse range of writers, including those from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. Learners should have the opportunity for theatrical exploration as an actor, designer and director gathering ideas from a variety of sources to enhance their understanding of drama.
- responding and reflecting - linked to live and/or recorded/live streamed performances as possible theatrical influences for the set texts and unprepared works. As learners make progress in Unit 3 they increasingly evaluate and create more sophisticated responses, independently to live and/or pre-recorded theatre. Their evaluation of work of others reflects a developing understanding of theatrical experience enabling them to form effective critique.

The texts chosen for Units 2 and 3 must be different.

## Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:

- Specification - this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to know by the end of their course.
- Assessment Pack - this contains the Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) i.e.: sample exam papers and sample NEA tasks, relevant controls for the NEA and, mark schemes This guide builds upon the information in the specification and assessment pack to help further your understanding of said documents.

## Understanding the specification amplification

Learners should be made aware of:

- the specification stems
- what the specification stems mean.

## Specification Stems

When you look through the specification you will notice in the amplification column, we use a variety of wording before the list of content learners need to know; we call this a stem:

| Specification Stem         | Amplification                                                                   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Learners are required to   | develop and apply their performance or design skills within a live performance. |
| Learners should be able to | reflect on, analyse and evaluate their own work                                 |

## Each stem is used for a slightly different reason

| Specification Stem         | When it is used                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Learners should know       | When learners are required to use direct recall.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Learners are required to   | When learners show the requirements of individual units.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Learners should understand | When learners are required to demonstrate greater depth than straight identification or recall, for example they can apply knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and can synthesise and evaluate information for a given purpose. |
| Learners should be able to | When learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques.                                                                                    |

## Command words

Learners should be made aware of:

- what command words are
- what each command word means
- what each command word assesses.

Command words are the words and phrases used in assessments that tell learners how they should answer the question or complete the task. Command words direct the learner through the question or task and indicate the nature of the response required.

<!-- image -->

The following tables are not exhaustive, but will give you a good idea of the command words we typically use:

## Mark Schemes

Mark schemes and/or assessment criteria test the intended learning outcomes for a component. They describe the knowledge and skills (and possibly attitude) that a candidate is expected to demonstrate in their responses and they are then used in marking the work.

## Objective based mark scheme:

For very short answer questions requiring one correct response.

| Question   | Question                                      | Answer                                        | Answer                                        | AO1                                           | AO2                                           | AO3                                           | Total Mark                                    |
