9,5,noted that they felt that,"Respondents **noted that they felt that** appropriate controls should be in place to ensure that all schools assess fairly, or there could be a lack of confidence in qualification results which would consequently mean learner attainment would have less value associated with it.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrase 'noted that they felt that' is wordy; 'noted that appropriate controls should be in place' is more concise.

18,8,around manageability,"However, we acknowledge the concerns that some respondents raised **around manageability**.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The use of 'around' is less formal than 'regarding' or 'about' in this professional context.
19,8,on or volume of work,"A couple of respondents proposed setting limits on the time spent **on or volume of work** to be submitted for the portfolio; however, after consulting further with stakeholders via our Development Advisory Group, we have decided not to proceed with this but to retain the current flexibility.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,90,"The preposition 'on' is missing before 'volume of work' to maintain parallel structure, making the phrase grammatically incomplete."
20,8,theory and practical,Some respondents welcomed the structure of the new qualification and felt it struck the right balance of **theory and practical**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"'Practical' is used as an adjective here; it should be a noun (e.g., 'practical application' or 'practical work') to parallel 'theory'."
21,8,noted their concern regarding,• Respondents **noted their concern regarding** the weighting of the examination unit in relation to the devising and performing units.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'noted their concern regarding' is slightly wordy; 'noted concerns regarding' or 'expressed concern regarding' would be more concise.

26,11,around,Some concerns were raised **around** the number of non-examination assessments. We are unable to address this as it reflects a decision made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria state that there must be two non-examination assessments that account for 40% of the qualification.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,"In formal writing, 'about' is generally preferred over 'around' when referring to a topic or subject of discussion."
27,11,non-examination assessment,"As the Approval Criteria state that one of the non-examination assessments must be marked by the centre and moderated by the WJEC, the Decision Making Exercise will now be marked by centres and moderated by WJEC; this **non-examination assessment** is 15% of the qualification and is therefore smaller than the fieldwork **non-examination assessment** at 25%.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,The repetition of 'non-examination assessment' makes the sentence verbose and could be rephrased for better flow and conciseness.
28,11,submission we,Following feedback on digital **submission we** will be exploring this further at the next stage of development.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,A comma is required after the introductory participial phrase 'Following feedback on digital submission' to separate it from the main clause.

32,13,and on non-religious,This was not the intention – the qualification will place equal value on religious **and on non-religious** beliefs and philosophical convictions.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The preposition 'on' is repeated unnecessarily before 'non-religious beliefs'.
33,13,in the time,Our specification writers are being guided on the number of Guided Learning Hours per unit to ensure that the content is teachable **in the time**.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,75,The phrasing 'in the time' is informal; 'within the allocated time' or 'within the time available' would be more appropriate for a formal document.

43,16,amount,Concerns were raised regarding the **amount** of work marked by the centre. We are unable to address these points as they reflect decisions made by Qualifications Wales; the Approval Criteria states that 50% of the qualification will be assessed through nonexamination assessment and marked by the centre.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"For countable items like 'work' (referring to individual tasks or pieces), 'number' is generally preferred over 'amount'."

This would help ensure the study of a range of literature whilst promoting flexibility and choice for centres in terms of topics, themes, and diversity.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"Given 'opportunities to add' and the mention of multiple units, 'set texts' (plural) is required for grammatical agreement."
50,17,a teacher,"WJEC received 164 responses, with half of the respondents answering on behalf of a school, the majority of those indicating that they were **a teacher**.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,"Since 'the majority of those' refers to multiple individuals, 'teachers' (plural) should be used instead of 'a teacher'."

52,18,to demand and challenge,"The anthology will ensure a standardised approach **to demand and challenge**, leading to an equitable experience for all learners.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'approach to demand and challenge' is slightly awkward; 'approach to managing demand and challenge' or 'approach to the level of demand and challenge' would be clearer.
53,18,not one unit focuses,"As a direct result of this feedback, we have redesigned some of the units so that **not one unit focuses** solely on oracy.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing 'no single unit focuses' or 'no unit focuses solely' would be more natural and common in formal writing.
54,18,utilise,"We believe this will lead to oracy assessments being conducted in more manageable batches that allow learners to **utilise** their knowledge and skills from the whole unit, rather than having an entire unit assessed only via oracy tasks.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"While 'utilise' is grammatically correct, 'use' is generally preferred for conciseness unless a specific nuance of making practical or effective use is intended."

Learners following the Single Award will now have the group discussion focused on non-fiction texts.",ErrorCategory.CONSISTENCY_ERROR,90,The document consistently uses 'learners' to refer to those undertaking the qualification; 'students' is inconsistent with this established terminology.

It appears to list two units but then uses 'and' in a way that makes 'Unit 3' the subject of 'requires', while 'the comparison of two unseen poems in Unit 1' is presented as a separate item, leading to ambiguity about the intended parallel structure or the subject of the second verb."
57,18,over,"Questions were raised **over** the inclusion of a Shakespeare text. This is a stipulation of the Approval Criteria for the Double Award, and we must therefore include it.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,"In this context, 'about' is generally preferred over 'over' when discussing a topic or subject."
58,18,were considered,"The length of the examinations for Units 1, 4 and 6 **were considered** by some respondents to be too long. Consequently, we have shortened the duration of these exams from 2 hours to 1.5 hours each.",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,98,"The subject of the sentence is 'The length' (singular), so the verb should be 'was considered' for subject-verb agreement."
59,19,Taking into regard,"**Taking into regard** all comments from the consultation, there was concern that five units may put learners off from opting for a language and that it would appear to be more challenging than other subjects.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrase 'Taking into consideration' or simply 'Considering' is more idiomatic and formal than 'Taking into regard'.
60,19,take up,Some responses in the consultation referred to non-tiering impacting learner confidence and **take up**.,ErrorCategory.SPELLING_ERROR,95,"As a noun phrase meaning 'adoption' or 'acceptance', 'take-up' should be hyphenated in British English (Collins Dictionary)."
