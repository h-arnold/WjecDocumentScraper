Assessment Type: Non-exam assessment

This  unit  is  designed  to  enable  you  to  develop
knowledge,  understanding  and  skills  within  the
creative process. You will be encouraged to make
personal  discoveries  and  take  creative  risks
through  your  own  investigations.  You  will  be
required to produce a portfolio:

through a sustained project that shows
development, reﬁnement, reﬂection and

WHAT SKILLS WILL I DEVELOP?

You  will  learn  to  use  a  broad  range  of  media,
techniques,
technologies  and
processes  depending  on  which  pathway  you
choose.  You  will  develop  the  skills  to  create
artefacts  –  whether  that  is  painting,  fashion
design,  content  creation,  photography,  or
architectural models (to name a few possibilities).
You will learn how to develop creative processes
and  working  methods  to  develop  the  visual
outcomes that you choose.

You will also learn and understand about working
independently (with teacher support) to develop
your own ideas and to meet deadlines set for your
work.  Through  all  of  this,  you  will  gain  an
awareness  of  sustainability  in  art  and  design  as
well  as  a  deeper  understanding  of  culture  and
identity  through  engaging  with  your  emerging
work.
