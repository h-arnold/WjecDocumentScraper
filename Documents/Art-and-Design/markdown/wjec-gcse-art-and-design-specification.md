- explore and appreciate the creative art, design and craft work of other people, develop their own creative talents and support investigative curiosity
- develop knowledge, appreciation and understanding of how meaning is communicated in art, design, and craft
- gain understanding of a range of practices and contexts in art, design, and craft, reflecting their interests and ambitions
- respond to and reflect on the art, design and craft work created by other people, applying knowledge of context to evaluate the effectiveness of ideas and techniques used to communicate meaning
- develop creative skills through experimenting and investigating to plan, devise and design images, artefacts and products with purpose and intent, recognising opportunities to realise ambitions
- develop practical and technical skills, communicating artistic intent with purpose and with increasing sophistication and control
- reflect on, refine, and evaluate their own work
- explore the cross-cutting themes of human rights and diversity, including Black, Asian, and minority ethnic perspectives, identity, culture, and contributions

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales' Approval Criteria.

### <span id="page-5-2"></span>1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Art and Design qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of what](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/statements-of-what-matters/)  [matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/statements-of-what-matters/) and those [subject specific skills and concepts](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area) outlined in the ['Designing your](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/designing-your-curriculum/)  [Curriculum'](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/designing-your-curriculum/) section of the Expressive Arts Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted on page 17; the Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery. 

{6}------------------------------------------------

The GCSE Art and Design qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:

- supporting the statements of what matters[1](#page-6-0) , by giving learners the opportunity to:
  - develop artistic skills and knowledge
  - respond and reflect as both artist and audience
  - be innovative and bold in developing their own artistic identity.
- supporting the principles of progressio[n](#page-6-1)<sup>2</sup> by giving learners the opportunity to:
  - make links in the creative process as they explore and innovate
  - create more sophisticated work
  - refine skills and techniques
  - gain confidence and resilience in giving and receiving feedback.
- supporting the key considerations for Art and Design[3](#page-6-2) by giving learners the opportunity to:
  - experiment and develop work through a range of resources, materials, techniques and processes
  - produce a range of outcomes and to demonstrate a personal and creative response.

They should demonstrate the ability to work creatively with processes and techniques appropriate to their chosen area(s) of study.

{12}------------------------------------------------

#### 1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of Art and Design at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

<span id="page-12-0"></span>

#### 1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE Art and Design has been designed to be delivered within 120 – 140 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

<span id="page-12-1"></span>

#### 1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

<span id="page-12-2"></span>

#### 1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website [\(www.jcq.org.uk\)](http://www.jcq.org.uk/).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

- that is internally set, in consultation with the teacher from personal and/or given starting point
- based on a theme, concept or specific design brief.

{16}------------------------------------------------

<span id="page-16-0"></span>

# Unit 2

#### Externally Set Assignment

Assessment Type: Non-examination assessment 40% of qualification 80 marks

#### Overview of unit

The purpose of this unit is to undertake contextual and practical research and supporting studies during a preparatory period. This will inform the learner's response during a 10-hour period of sustained focus.

The Externally Set Assignment contains five overarching big ideas. Learners must choose one big idea only and use any of the stimuli from the big idea as a starting point to inform their work.

Learners will be required to produce a response:

- demonstrating development, refinement, reflection and presentation
- that is based on one of the big ideas.

In this unit, learners will apply the knowledge, understanding and skills developed during Unit 1 in response to the big ideas set by WJEC.

The Externally Set Assignment will be released to centres prior to the end of the autumn term in the final year of the course to allow for planning and preparation of supporting materials. The Externally Set Assignment should be released to learners during the spring term in the final year of study.

#### Examples of Big Ideas:

# Opportunities for integration of learning experiences

GCSE Art and Design generates opportunities for the following learning experiences to be developed (the experiences will not be directly assessed):

- experience a variety of professional works through workshops and gallery/exhibitions/museum visits either in person or on-screen
- develop confidence in giving and receiving feedback, promoting independent thinking, originality and creative resilience
- opportunities to investigate, take risks and overcome creative challenges
- gain an awareness of the different careers, roles and individual work practices associated with the production of art, craft, and design in the creative and cultural industries
- use of digital technology as appropriate to the chosen pathway
- gain a basic awareness of ethical and legal considerations as appropriate.

The Guidance for Teaching will include further information on the opportunities provided by the qualification for teachers/centres to integrate these learning experiences into the delivery of the qualification.

For opportunities to develop cross-cutting themes, cross-curricular skills and integral skills please see Appendix A.

<span id="page-18-1"></span>

# 3.1 Assessment objectives and weightings

The Assessment Pack will include all detailed information relating to assessment.

Below are the assessment objectives for this specification. Learners must:

#### AO1

Develop ideas and demonstrate critical and contextual understanding of sources

#### AO2

Refine work by exploring ideas, selecting and experimenting with appropriate media, techniques, tools, digital technologies, and processes

#### AO3

Reflect on own work, and record ideas, observations and insights relevant to intentions as work progresses

#### AO4

Present a personal and meaningful response that realises intentions and demonstrates understanding of visual language

The table below shows the weighting of each assessment objective for each unit and for the qualification as a whole.

|                   | AO1 | AO2 | AO3 | AO4 | Total |
|-------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| Unit 1            | 15% | 15% | 15% | 15% | 60%   |

# 3.2 Overview of arrangements for non-examination assessment

The framework below is the suggested schedule for centres.

![](_page_19_Figure_3.jpeg)

There is no restriction on content, format or scale of work or the amount of evidence to be selected and presented, although emphasis should be on quality rather than quantity.

Units could be presented in any appropriate format(s) such as:

- display sheets
- visual diaries
- sketchbook(s)/workbook(s)
- a digital portfolio
- mounted exhibitions
- installations
- digital presentation.

#### Unit 1: Overview

Learners should start developing their portfolio after they have been introduced to the knowledge, understanding and skills outlined in the subject content. Learners should be provided with opportunities to develop and expand practical knowledge and understanding through workshops in the chosen pathway.

Teachers can review learners' work and provide oral and written advice at a general level in order to secure a functional outcome.

The centre must ensure that the work an individual learner submits for assessment is their own.

Learners can have access to resources and/preparatory notes.

It is recommended that portfolio work should begin during the spring or summer term in the first year of study. The portfolio must be completed before Unit 2 (Externally Set Assignment) is presented to learners in the spring term of the final year of study. Candidates work should be stored securely after submission and during the marking, moderation and review periods. Candidates work should not be released until the Review of Marking and Moderation period has expired.

{20}------------------------------------------------

#### Unit 2: Overview

The Externally Set Assignment will be released on the WJEC Portal on December 1 st in the final year of each series. This is strictly for teachers only, to prepare resources for learners.

The Externally Set Assignment should be introduced to learners after the submission of the portfolio, during the second term of the final year of study.

Learners are required to select one of the big ideas and develop it in the form of:

- a personal response
- a specific design brief
- or another suitable approach.

### PART 1: preparatory study period

Learners will develop their response over a preparatory study period. The amount of time allocated to this is determined by the centre.

Responses will be researched, developed and refined during the preparatory study period. They should take the form of practical, critical and contextual preparatory work/supporting studies along with reflections on the process. Only work produced during the preparatory period can be used and taken forward to Part 2.

Part 1 of Unit 2 has the same controls as Unit 1 as stated in the Assessment Pack.

### PART 2: sustained focus period

This must be undertaken with direct supervision.

The teacher cannot provide any advice or feedback on learners' work.

Learners can have access to resources and/preparatory notes produced in Part 1 only.

Learners have a maximum of 10 hours to produce their outcome, which must begin with a minimum 2-hour session.

### Submission of marks

Centres are required to submit marks for both internally assessed units online during the summer term of the final year of study in preparation for moderation.

When marks have been submitted to WJEC, the online system will apply the sample formula based on the overall rank order for the total entry and immediately identify the sample of candidates whose work is selected for moderation.

{21}------------------------------------------------

<span id="page-21-0"></span>

# 4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for GCSE Art and Design.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our [Guide to preventing, reporting and](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)  [investigating malpractice.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC (malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet [Suspected](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)  [Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)

# 5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

<span id="page-22-1"></span>

### 5.1 Making entries

This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the course.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series until the end of the life of this specification. Summer 2027 will be the first assessment opportunity.

A qualification may be taken more than once.

Marks for non-examination assessment (NEA) may be carried forward for the life of the specification. If a candidate resits a unit (rather than carrying forward the previous NEA mark), it is the new mark that will count towards the overall grade, even if it is lower than a previous attempt (unless the mark is absent).

The entry code appears below.
