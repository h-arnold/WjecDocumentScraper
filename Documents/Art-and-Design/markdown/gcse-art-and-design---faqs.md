## General

Q: In the previous specification, learners were required to complete a 'Creative Statement' which provided context to the work to support the moderation process. As this is no longer a requirement, what is required from learners to replace this?

A: Learners can use their preparatory work in both Unit 1 and Unit 2 to show supporting annotation within their work. The Sample Assessment Material for Unit 1 - Portfolio and Unit 2 - Externally Set Assignment clarifies this further.

- Q: Should candidates be encouraged to work from primary source material to develop their ideas and observations?

A: This is strongly recommended and expanded upon in the Guidance for Teaching.

- Q: Are teachers allowed to provide feedback to individual learners about their work after they have started the portfolio (Unit 1)?

A: Teachers can provide feedback to learners at a general level in Unit 1 and the preparation phase (Part 1) of Unit 2. During Part 2, the sustained focus period, the teacher cannot provide any advice or feedback on learners' work - please refer to page 20 of the Specification. Further guidance for conducting NEA is provided by JCQ in the following document: Instructions for conducting non-examination assessments

## Unit 1

- Q: Can learners start working on Unit 1 at any time in the course (i.e.: January of Year 10 or September of Year 11)?

A: Unit 1 can be started at any time during the course, this can be selected by the centre. The specification shows a suggested schedule for centres on page 19 which centres may wish to follow.

- Q: If a learner does not like the topic selected by the teacher for Unit 1, are they allowed to choose their own.

A: Yes, they can, in consultation with the class teacher to ensure appropriateness. In Unit 2, topics must be selected from the ESA.

- Q: Can the whole class do the same topic so that the teacher can manage them through Unit 1?

A: They can, though learners should be encouraged to diversify so that the work is personal.

- Q: Can learners return to work on Unit 1 after Unit 2 has been completed?

A: No, Unit 1: Portfolio must be completed before Unit 2: Externally Set Assignment is presented to learners. This is outlined on page 4 of the specification.

## Unit 2

- Q: The date of release of the Externally Set Assignment to learners remains the 2 nd January in the year of awarding however teachers will now have access to the ESA in the December immediately prior to this. Can we ask learners to start work on this in December?

A: No, information must remain secure until after 2nd January. This is strictly for teachers only, to prepare resources for learners.

- Q: Who should decide which 'big idea' the learners do for Unit 2 - ESA?

A: Learners must be offered the entire ESA digital paper and should select their own topic.

## Q: My centre has previously carried out the 10-hour supervised time period within lesson time - how will we manage this now that there is a requirement to start with a minimum two-hour session?

A: It is a requirement of the specification (see page 20) and centres must provide the minimum of a 2-hour session to start. Longer time periods can be provided to suit centre requirements.

## Q: I have a learner who didn't enter Unit 2: Part 2. Will I still be able to submit a mark for them?

A: No, the learner must complete the final response during Part 2 (sustained focus period).

## Q: Do candidates need to complete the full 10 hours of the supervised time period?

A: The 10 hours can be broken down in a way to suit the centre however the first two hours must be consecutive. Learners must complete this two-hour period as a minimum.

## Assessment

## Q: Learners find the language used in the legacy Assessment Objective checklist challenging - will this be made more user friendly?

A: There is no longer a separate 'checklist' associated with the Assessment Objectives. The Assessment Objective wording has been clarified in the marking criteria. Teachers should regularly use the language associated with the different mark bands within the Assessment Objectives in lessons to ensure that learners understand the specific terms used. Please see the Mark Scheme for Unit 1 and Unit 2 in the Sample Assessment Materials for the specific language to be used.

## Q: Should learners be presenting everything that they have done in the course for assessment?

A: It is not anticipated that all work should be submitted for assessment however it is important that learners show evidence that best meets all the assessment objectives. Learners should select and present their work for assessment. This applies to Unit 1 and both Part 1 and Part 2 of Unit 2; work completed in the Sustained Focus Period must be identified in the submission. Please see the Sample Assessment Materials for more information (Unit 1, page 4 and Unit 2, page 5).
