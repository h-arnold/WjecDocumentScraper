<span id="page-3-1"></span>

# Managing the assessment

This is a centre-marked (internal) non-examination assessment. The following arrangements must be followed when managing and marking the assessment

## Time

There are no set timings for Unit 1 Portfolio, but centres are encouraged to follow the suggested framework in the specification to ensure that time for learners is manageable.

## Resources

In many subjects, candidates will need to gather information from published sources when researching and planning their tasks.

Candidates are allowed access to the internet and any electronic and printed resources available to them.

## Collaboration

Collaboration is permitted. Candidates are permitted to work in groups.

### However:

• where candidates are required to construct an artefact, or contribute to a performance, their individual contributions must be clearly identified.

Whilst group work may be permitted, group assessment is not. Members of the group will have made different contributions, and the work of each candidate must be individually assessed and therefore will not receive the same mark.

The teacher's record must describe individual candidates' contribution to any group work.

{4}------------------------------------------------

## Supervision

Work may be completed outside of the centre without direct supervision. Where no supervision is specified, candidates may normally:

- have unlimited access to electronic and printed resources
- use the internet without restriction
- work in groups.

## Authentication

Supervision must be in place to ensure the authenticity of evidence produced for summative assessment.

You should not provide input or guidance to candidates during the assessment time. This includes providing formative feedback on the evidence being produced. You can provide guidance on the requirements of the task and remind candidates of the mark bands and how they can be interpreted.

Candidates can review and redraft evidence independently within the time controls for the assessment.

Candidates must sign the declaration to confirm that all evidence submitted for moderation is their own work and that any sources used have been acknowledged.

Assessors must sign the declaration to confirm that evidence submitted for moderation was completed under the controlled conditions set out in this assessment.

## Candidate evidence

The acceptable formats for evidence of each of the tasks is summarised in the task tables. Any modified assessment must enable the candidate to generate the evidence required in this table

## Marking the assessment

The marking scheme for this assessment are included in the candidate pack.

All marking of evidence must be made against the marking scheme provided. Evidence marked must comply with any requirements set out in the assessment pack.

Written evidence must be annotated to show how it relates to the mark band requirements.

Marking should only be undertaken by a designated assessor. An assessor should have appropriate expertise in the subject and level for a specified unit. The assessor is responsible for ensuring that:

- assessment is conducted under the controls specified in the task table
- they are clear about the requirements of the assessment and marking scheme prior to commencing assessment
- evidence presented for assessment is valid, authentic; reliable and credible
- assessment decisions are accurately recorded
- evidence is appropriately annotated
- judgements are only made against the mark band statements.

{5}------------------------------------------------

A mark record sheet must be completed for each candidate.

## Further information

You should refer the to WJEC Assessment Guide / JCQ Instructions for conducting nonexamination assessment for further information on managing assessment within our GCSE Qualifications.

**This pack is the live assessment. It must not be used for practice purposes.**

# Unit 1 – Portfolio

## Assessment details

### Unit 1: Portfolio Non-examination assessment 60% of qualification 120 marks

120 marks

Work undertaken within the unit will be internally set, marked by centres and moderated by WJEC.

## Overview of unit

This unit is designed to enable learners to develop their knowledge, understanding and skills within the creative process. Learners should be encouraged to make personal discoveries and take creative risks through their own investigations.

Learners will be required to produce a practical portfolio:

- through a sustained project(s) demonstrating development, refinement, reflection and presentation
- that is internally set, in consultation with the teacher from personal and/or given starting points
- based on a theme, concept or specific design brief.

It is recommended that portfolio work should begin during the spring or summer term in the first year of study, and end before Unit 2 (Externally Set Assignment) is released to learners of the spring term of final year of study.

<span id="page-6-1"></span>

## What is the Unit 1 Portfolio?

The portfolio is a body of work based on a theme, concept or specific design brief which is of personal significance to the learner. Learners should develop the intention of their portfolio in consultation with their teacher.

Work produced for assessment must be their own unaided work. The learner and teacher will be required to sign a declaration that all work presented is the learner's own work.

<span id="page-6-2"></span>

## What should be included in the Unit 1 Portfolio?

The following needs to be taken into consideration when developing the portfolio:

- the portfolio must contain evidence of how the learner has met each of the assessment objectives
- annotating their work will help learners meet elements of the assessment objectives
- work must be selected and presented for assessment by the learner
- learners should develop their intentions through the work in one portfolio.

{7}------------------------------------------------

<span id="page-7-0"></span>

# Submitting the Portfolio

- The Portfolio must be submitted internally before the start of Unit 2.
- It must be stored securely at the centre and cannot be amended once submitted.
- The Portfolio must be clearly identified with centre and candidate names and numbers.
- If a learner is entered for more than one pathway, they must submit a different portfolio for each one.
- Using the *Candidate Declaration Form* the learner should declare that their work was completed independently and without any assistance beyond what should be permitted. They should clearly reference any sources and any Artificial Intelligence tools used in the work. The learner should understand that a false declaration should be considered a form of malpractice. All work should be their own, except for any non-original material that should be clearly credited in the form. This work should not be submitted for any other qualification.

<span id="page-7-1"></span>

# Internal Standardisation

Centres should ensure consistency in marking across all pathways and teaching groups. This helps maintain a uniform understanding and application of the marking criteria. Centres must carry out internal standardisation to make sure that the marks given by different teachers are accurate and consistent for all learners taking the unit/qualification. The WJEC website will include exemplar material to support standardisation.

## Mark Scheme

## Guidance for Assessors

<span id="page-8-0"></span>

## Generic marking principles

- Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).
- Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).
- Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

### Positive marking

It should be remembered that credit should be given for what the candidate produces, rather than adopting the approach of penalising candidates for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect response if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

### Banded mark schemes

To reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been provided, no marks should be awarded.

Marking should always be positive. This means that, for each candidate's response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills, knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors or omissions.

An assessor should first look at and make notes about the candidate's response holistically to pick out the evidence that is being assessed. The mark scheme can then be applied. This is done as a two-stage process.

#### Stage 1 – Deciding on the band

Beginning at the lowest band, Assessors should look at the candidate's response and check whether it matches the descriptors for that band. If the descriptors at the lowest band are satisfied, Assessors should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the descriptors most closely match the work.

#### Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark

Having determined the appropriate band, deciding on the mark within a band will be made on the basis of a 'best fit' procedure, weaknesses in some areas being compensated for by strengths in others.

{9}------------------------------------------------

Assessors should use the full range of marks available to them. The awarding of marks must be directly related to the marking criteria, and all responses must be marked according to the banded levels provided.

Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be available on Portal (WJEC secure website) and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work. Assessors are reminded of the need to revisit the standardising material as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the work submitted.

Candidates are free to choose any approach that is relevant to the set task.

# About this pack: information and instructions for candidates

This candidate assessment pack is for candidates completing Unit 1 – Portfolio.

Within this pack, you will find details of:

- what you should include in your work
- information for candidates, which tells you about things that you must and must not do when you are completing the assessment
- the mark scheme which will be used to assess your work
- a Candidate Declaration Form

Your teacher is allowed to help you to understand the assessment requirements, , but there are rules about the kind of help and how much they can give you. You should speak to your teacher if you have any questions about what you are and are not allowed to do as you are completing the tasks, as they will know how much help they are allowed to give you.

Work produced for assessment should be your own unaided work. You and your teacher will be required to sign a declaration that all work presented is your own work.

You are advised to check your work carefully to make sure that it is accurate and correct.

## What is the Unit 1 Portfolio?

The portfolio is a body of work based on a theme, concept or specific design brief which is of personal significance to you. You should develop the intention of your portfolio in consultation with your teacher. You should speak to your teacher if you have any questions about what you are and are not allowed to do as you are completing the portfolio, as they will know how much help they are allowed to give you.

### What should be included in the Unit 1 Portfolio?

The following needs to be taken into consideration when developing your portfolio: The portfolio must contain evidence of how you have met each of the assessment objectives

- You must annotate your work. This will help you meet elements of the assessment objectives
- Work will be selected and presented for assessment by you

{14}------------------------------------------------

The guidance in the graphic below will outlines what your work should include.

**Produce a personal response Select work that demonstrates your meanings and intentions Communicate using appropriate elements of visual language Explain and realise your intentions, making connections between the different parts of the work and work of others Select a suitable format for presenting work to engage the audience Generate ideas Show awareness of methods and approaches used in other people's work Analyse why the work was produced (intentions) and what it was made for (purpose) Generate further creative ideas from your reflections Show how your ideas have formed Explore ideas Make informed choices through exploring a breadth of media, techniques and processes Demonstrate control of creative skills, whilst using them imaginatively Review and refine your work to take it forward Record ideas in visual and/or written forms (such as drawing, writing, photographs, speaking etc...) Make observations and insights about your intentions/work Identify the areas of your work that are personal and meaningful Reflect as your work progresses Review what you have learned and how you might use it.** AO1 AO2 AO3 AO4

# Submitting the Portfolio

- You must complete your portfolio before you start Unit 2. It will be stored securely at your centre, and you cannot amend it once submitted.
- The Portfolio must be clearly identified with your centre and candidate name and number.
- If you are entered for more than one pathway you must submit a different portfolio for each one.
- Using the *Candidate Declaration Form* you should declare that the work was completed independently and without any assistance beyond what should be permitted. You should clearly reference any sources and any Artificial Intelligence tools used in the work. A false declaration should be considered a form of malpractice. All work must be your own, except for any non-original material that should be clearly credited in the form. This work should not be submitted for any other qualification.

{16}------------------------------------------------

# Information for candidates

The following information has been taken from the [JCQ Information for candidates –](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) non[examination assessments](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) and the [JCQ Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) Use in Assessments:](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/)  [Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/) This tells you about things that you **must** and **must not** do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not understand, you **must** ask your teacher.

## Preparing your work

- When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you need to ensure that your final product reflects your own independent work and isn't copied or paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
- If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you **must** tell your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
- If you worked as part of a group on a task, you **must** each write up your own account of the assignment. Even if the data you have is the same, you **must** describe in your own words how that data was obtained, and you **must** independently draw your own conclusions from the data.
- Take care of your work and keep it safe. **Do not** leave it lying around where your classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You **must** always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; **do not** share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
- **Do not** be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI tools and chatbots) – this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort of copying.
- You **must not** write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

## Plagiarism

Plagiarism involves taking someone else's words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them off as your own. **It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously.** Don't think you won't be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:

- Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
- Markers are highly experienced subject specialists they may have read the source you are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!
- Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and style of writing or punctuation.

## Penalties for breaking the regulations

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be applied:

- the piece of work will be awarded zero marks
- you will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question
- you will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series
- you will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

**Remember – it's your qualification so it needs to be your own work.**
