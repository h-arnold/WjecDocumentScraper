2,7,to help inspire,Looking at work from other contexts outside their own knowledge helps learners to increase knowledge and understanding of art and design **to help inspire** new ideas.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing 'to help inspire' is slightly clunky; 'and inspire' or 'to inspire' would be more concise and natural.
3,7,encouraging this to be celebrated,It is important to note that learners will come from a variety of cultural backgrounds and **encouraging this to be celebrated** will support an independent and individual approach to their work.,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing is slightly awkward; 'encouraging its celebration' or 'encouraging that this is celebrated' would be more natural.

This idea of 'meaning' can be amplified to learners through discussion while reviewing other art or design works in the classroom, galleries, studios or workshops.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The use of single quotation marks around a list of adjectives without attribution is stylistically awkward and misleading; they should either be removed or the source attributed.

26,16,in the learners' intention,...and can aid the assessing teacher and moderator **in the learners' intention**.,ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,The phrasing is ungrammatical; it should be 'in understanding the learners' intention' or 'with the learners' intention'.
27,16,exploration and experimental phase,"Links should be clearly made between the initial context, the **exploration and experimental phase**, the reflection of these intentions and the fulfilment of a meaningful response.",ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,85,The phrasing is awkward; 'exploratory and experimental phase' or 'exploration and experimentation phase' would be more grammatically parallel and clear.
28,17,developing an understanding of,"As part of the contextual investigation which happens, usually, in the early stages of Unit 1 and Unit 2 **developing an understanding of**:",ErrorCategory.ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR,95,This is a sentence fragment; it lacks a main verb for the subject 'As part of the contextual investigation'.
29,17,what in this is relevant,- where was the artist or designer working and **what in this is relevant**,ErrorCategory.STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE,80,The phrasing is informal and slightly awkward; 'what aspects of this are relevant' or 'the relevance of this' would be more formal and precise.
