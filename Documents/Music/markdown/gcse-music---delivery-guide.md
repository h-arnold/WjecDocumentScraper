# <span id="page-3-0"></span>Aims of the Delivery Guide

The aim of the Delivery Guide is to give an overview of the qualification and to help teachers understand how we assess the GCSE. It will offer an introduction to the specification, an assessment overview, and will support teachers in better understanding how to prepare their learners for the assessment of the different units in each qualification. More information on each unit can be found in the separate unit guides.

# <span id="page-3-1"></span>Qualification Structure

#### WJEC GCSE Music consists of three units:

|        | Unit title | Type of Assessment         | Weighting |
|--------|------------|----------------------------|-----------|
| Unit 1 | Performing | Non-examination assessment | 32.5%     |
| Unit 2 | Composing  | Non-examination assessment | 32.5%     |
| Unit 3 | Appraising | Digital only examination   | 35%       |

All units are compulsory.

#### <span id="page-3-2"></span>Unit 1

The purpose of this unit is to:

- allow learners to explore a range of performing repertoire and select pieces they wish to perform
- allow learners to develop their technical and performing skills by reflecting on their work in an ongoing cycle of practice and improvement
- provide opportunities for learners to perform individually and/or as part of an ensemble and develop the skills required to become proficient
- develop learners' resilience, determination and confidence.

#### This unit will focus on:

- **exploring** learners will have the opportunity to explore and perform a range of repertoire, from various genres and periods and linked to different cultures in Wales and the world. This could include performing using any instrument, voice, or technology, as a soloist or as part of an ensemble
- **responding and reflecting** learners will have the opportunity to reflect on their own work and respond to the feedback from others to focus their practice, allowing them to improve in the performances they give, with increased technical ability and communication
- **creating** learners will have the opportunity to include improvisation in their performances, and with practice, to become more proficient and confident in this skill. In experiencing the process of creating their final performances, they will also be able to interpret repertoire in a way which is appropriate to their own ability and personal style choices.

{4}------------------------------------------------

For this assessment, learners are required to perform:

- a minimum of **two** pieces of music giving a total performance time of 4-6 mins (each piece should be a minimum of 1 minute)
- solos or independent parts within ensembles, or a combination of both, in their chosen style(s) of music, without a conductor.

#### <span id="page-4-0"></span>Unit 2

#### The purpose of this unit is to:

- develop an awareness of the process of creating original music
- develop learners' skills in self-evaluation, refinement and development of their own work
- develop a sense of writing music for a specific purpose
- allow learners to explore creating music in a variety of different genres and styles, from different periods.

#### The unit will focus on:

- **exploring** learners will have the opportunity to explore various styles and genres of music linked to different cultures in Wales and the world, and understand how they have been created to produce the intended effect. They will be able to use these methods to create and develop their own ideas. They will also be able to compose through exploring ideas in improvisation
- **responding and reflecting** learners will be able to evaluate and refine their work through reflection and feedback from others to create a successful finished product
- **creating** learners will create their own original music in a style of their choosing, and a piece to meet a brief specified by WJEC using the techniques they have explored and reflected upon.

#### For this assessment learners are required to:

- compose **two** original pieces of music with a recommended total duration of between 3-6 mins, **one** in response to their own devised brief and **one** in response to a brief set by WJEC
- present a reflective log based on the compositional process of **either** the composition in response to their own devised brief, **or** the composition based on the brief set by WJEC.

# <span id="page-4-1"></span>Unit 3

#### The purpose of this unit is to:

- allow learners to experience a range of music from contrasting styles/genres and periods/contexts, including music created in or inspired by Wales and written by a diverse range of composers including those from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds
- allow learners to develop transferable listening skills based on an appreciation of the elements of music and how they are used
- develop the language of describing and analysing music
- demonstrate aural skills in relation to familiar and unfamiliar music
- allow learners to develop as creative musicians through understanding the music of others.

{5}------------------------------------------------

#### The unit will focus on:

- **exploring** learners will have the opportunity to experience listening to a wide range of music to understand how the composers and performers create the intended effect, tell a story or convey emotions including through the use of music technology
- **responding and reflecting** learners will be able to identify links between different pieces of music in terms of the use of the elements of music and respond to the effectiveness of these in contrasting styles or genres.

{7}------------------------------------------------

# <span id="page-7-0"></span>Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:

- Specification this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to know by the end of their course.
- Assessment Pack this contains the Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) i.e.: sample exam papers and sample NEA tasks, relevant controls for the NEA and, mark schemes.

This guide builds upon the information in the specification and assessment pack to help further your understanding of said documents.

# <span id="page-7-1"></span>Understanding the specification amplification

Learners should be made aware of:

- the specification stems
- what the specification stems mean.

### <span id="page-7-2"></span>Specification Stems

When you look through the specification you will notice in the amplification column, we use a variety of wording before the list of content learners need to know; we call this a stem:

![](_page_7_Figure_12.jpeg)

Each stem is used for a slightly different reason:

| Specification Stem             | When it is used                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Learners should know | When learners are required to use direct recall. |
| Learners should be aware of | When learners do not need to understand all aspects of the specified content in detail. |
| Learners should understand | When learners are required to demonstrate greater depth than straight identification or recall, for example they can apply knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and can synthesise and evaluate information for a given purpose. |
| Learners should be able to | When learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques. |
| Learners are required to | When learners need to show the requirements of individual units. |

{8}------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="page-8-0"></span>Command words

Learners should be made aware of:

- what command words are
- what each command word means
- what each command word assesses.

Command words are the words and phrases used in assessments that tell learners how they should answer the question or complete the task. Command words direct the learner through the question or task and indicate the nature of the response required.

![](_page_8_Picture_7.jpeg)

The following tables are not exhaustive, but will give you a good idea of the command words we typically use:

| Command words for direct recall |                                |  |  |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|--|--|
| Command Word                    | Requirements of response       |  |  |
| Give                            | Produce an answer from recall. |  |  |
| Name                            | Identify or make a list.       |  |  |
| State                           | Express in clear terms.        |  |  |

| Command words for reflection, analysis and evaluation:                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                             |  |  |  |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|--|
| Command Word                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Requirements of response                                                                    |  |  |  |
| Complete | Complete notation of pitch or rhythm in the treble or bass clef as a dictation exercise. |  |  |  |
| Identify distinctive features and give descriptive, factual detail. This is one of the most widely used command words. If an Describe explanation is required then use two command words: 'describe and explain'. |  |  |  |  |
| Explain | Give reasons or causes. Show an understanding of how or why something has occurred. |  |  |  |
| Select                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Make an appropriate choice from a range of options.                                         |  |  |  |

{9}------------------------------------------------

#### Mark Schemes

Mark schemes and/or assessment criteria test the intended learning outcomes for a component. They describe the knowledge and skills (and possibly attitude) that a candidate is expected to demonstrate in their responses and they are then used in marking the work.

#### **Objective based mark scheme:**

For very short answer questions requiring one correct response.

| Question |  | Answer | AO1 | AO3 | Total Mark |
|----------|-----|------------------------------------------------------------|-----|-----|---------------|
| 1 | (a) | Select the section of Palladio heard in the extract. |  |  |  |
