Aims of the Delivery Guide

The aim of the Delivery Guide is to give an overview of the qualification and to help teachers
understand how we assess the GCSE. It will offer an introduction to the specification, an
assessment overview, and will support teachers in better understanding how to prepare their
learners for the assessment of the different units in each qualification. More information on
each unit can be found in the separate unit guides.

Qualification Structure

WJEC GCSE Music consists of three units:

Unit title

Type of Assessment

Weighting

Unit 1  Performing

Non-examination assessment

32.5%

Unit 2  Composing

Non-examination assessment

32.5%

Unit 3  Appraising

Digital only examination

35%

All units are compulsory.

Unit 1

The purpose of this unit is to:
•  allow learners to explore a range of performing repertoire and select pieces

they wish to perform

•  allow learners to develop their technical and performing skills by reflecting on their work

in an ongoing cycle of practice and improvement

•  provide opportunities for learners to perform individually and/or as part of an

ensemble and develop the skills required to become proficient

•  develop learners’ resilience, determination and confidence.

This unit will focus on:
•  exploring – learners will have the opportunity to explore and perform a range of

•

repertoire, from various genres and periods and linked to different cultures in Wales and
the world. This could include performing using any instrument, voice, or technology, as a
soloist or as part of an ensemble
responding and reflecting – learners will have the opportunity to reflect on their own
work and respond to the feedback from others to focus their practice, allowing them to
improve in the performances they give, with increased technical ability and
communication

•  creating – learners will have the opportunity to include improvisation in their

performances, and with practice, to become more proficient and confident in this skill. In
experiencing the process of creating their final performances, they will also be able to
interpret repertoire in a way which is appropriate to their own ability and personal style
choices.

Delivery Guide GCSE Music 2

For this assessment, learners are required to perform:
•  a minimum of two pieces of music giving a total performance time of 4-6 mins (each

piece should be a minimum of 1 minute)

•  solos or independent parts within ensembles, or a combination of both, in their chosen

style(s) of music, without a conductor.

Unit 2

The purpose of this unit is to:
•  develop an awareness of the process of creating original music
•  develop learners’ skills in self-evaluation, refinement and development of their own work
•  develop a sense of writing music for a specific purpose
•  allow learners to explore creating music in a variety of different genres and styles, from

different periods.

The unit will focus on:
•  exploring – learners will have the opportunity to explore various styles and genres of

music linked to different cultures in Wales and the world, and understand how they have
been created to produce the intended effect. They will be able to use these methods to
create and develop their own ideas. They will also be able to compose through exploring
ideas in improvisation
responding and reflecting – learners will be able to evaluate and refine their work
through reflection and feedback from others to create a successful finished product
•  creating – learners will create their own original music in a style of their choosing, and a
piece to meet a brief specified by WJEC using the techniques they have explored and
reflected upon.

•

For this assessment learners are required to:
•  compose two original pieces of music with a recommended total duration of between 3-6
mins, one in response to their own devised brief and one in response to a brief set by
WJEC

•  present a reflective log based on the compositional process of either the composition in
response to their own devised brief, or the composition based on the brief set by WJEC.

Unit 3

The purpose of this unit is to:
•  allow learners to experience a range of music from contrasting styles/genres and
periods/contexts, including music created in or inspired by Wales and written by a
diverse range of composers including those from Black, Asian and minority ethnic
backgrounds

•  allow learners to develop transferable listening skills based on an appreciation of the

elements of music and how they are used

•  develop the language of describing and analysing music
•  demonstrate aural skills in relation to familiar and unfamiliar music
•  allow learners to develop as creative musicians through understanding the music of

others.

Specification and Assessment Pack

When we develop new qualifications, we produce the following documents:
•  Specification – this covers all the information and skills that learners are expected to

know by the end of their course.

•  Assessment Pack – this contains the Sample Assessment Materials (SAMs) i.e.: sample
exam papers and sample NEA tasks, relevant controls for the NEA and, mark schemes.

This guide builds upon the information in the specification and assessment pack to help
further your understanding of said documents.

Understanding the specification amplification

Learners should be made aware of:
•
•  what the specification stems mean.

the specification stems

Specification Stems

When you look through the specification you will notice in the amplification column, we use a
variety of wording before the list of content learners need to know; we call this a stem:

Learners should:

•  be able to use technical vocabulary to describe how

the elements of music are used.

Learners should:

•  understand how knowledge gained in performing and

appraising music can be used to develop their
compositions.

Each stem is used for a slightly different reason:

Command words

Learners should be made aware of:
•  what command words are
•  what each command word means
•  what each command word assesses.

Command words are the words and phrases used in assessments that tell learners how they
should answer the question or complete the task. Command words direct the learner through
the question or task and indicate the nature of the response required.

 Name the chord heard on the 3rd beat of bar 14.

component. They describe the knowledge and skills (and possibly attitude) that a candidate
is expected to demonstrate in their responses and they are then used in marking the work.
