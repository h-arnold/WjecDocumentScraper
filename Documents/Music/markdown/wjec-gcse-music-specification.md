## GCSE MUSIC

### <span id="page-6-0"></span>1 INTRODUCTION

#### <span id="page-6-1"></span>1.1 Aims

GCSE Music supports learners to:

- explore music created and performed by other people and develop their own musical talents
- gain understanding of a range of musical forms, styles and genres, and musical elements
- develop knowledge, understanding and appreciation of how meaning is communicated musically
- respond to and reflect on others' music, applying knowledge of context to evaluate the effectiveness of ideas and techniques used to communicate meaning
- develop performance/ realisation skills to communicate musically and demonstrate control
- develop creative skills to manipulate musical ideas to communicate meaning
- reflect on, refine, and evaluate their own work
- explore the cross-cutting themes of human rights and diversity, including Black, Asian, and minority ethnic perspectives, identity, culture, and contributions.

These aims are set out in Qualifications Wales' Approval Criteria.

#### <span id="page-6-2"></span>1.2 Curriculum for Wales

This GCSE Music qualification is underpinned by the Curriculum for Wales framework and has been designed to ensure that learners can continue to make progress towards the four purposes whilst studying for this qualification. Central to this design are the [principles of progression,](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/principles-of-progression/) along with the [statements of what](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/statements-of-what-matters/)  [matters](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/statements-of-what-matters/) and those [subject specific skills and concepts](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/designing-your-curriculum/#discipline-specific-considerations) outlined in the ['Designing your](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/designing-your-curriculum/)  [Curriculum'](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/designing-your-curriculum/) section of the Expressive Arts Area of Learning and Experiences.

In developing this qualification, we have considered where there are opportunities to embed the cross-curricular themes and where there are opportunities for integral skills and cross-curricular skills to be developed. Appendix A provides a simple mapping, and information to support teachers will be provided in the Guidance for Teaching.

We have also considered where the qualification can generate opportunities for integrating the learning experiences noted in Opportunities for Integration of Learning Experiences and Skills on page 16. The Guidance for Teaching will include further information on integrating these learning experiences into delivery.

{7}------------------------------------------------

The GCSE Music qualification supports the Curriculum for Wales by:

- supporting the statements of what matters for Expressive Arts[1](#page-7-2) :
  - **exploring** the Expressive Arts is essential to developing artistic skills and knowledge and it enables learners to become curious and creative individuals
  - **responding** and **reflecting**, both as artist and audience, is a fundamental part of learning in the Expressive Arts
  - **creating** combines skills and knowledge, drawing on the senses, inspiration and imagination.
- supporting the principles of progression[2](#page-7-3) by encouraging learners to:
  - explore, experience, interpret, create and respond to increasingly complex meaning
  - develop an increased sophistication of conceptual learning
  - have more sophisticated use of relevant skills and the ability to transfer existing skills and knowledge into new contexts.
- supporting the subject specific considerations[3](#page-7-4) for Music:
  - through the creative process, allowing learners to explore, respond to stimuli and create and reflect on their own work while engaging in rich, authentic experiences.

#### <span id="page-7-0"></span>1.3 Prior learning and progression

Although there is no specific requirement for prior learning, the qualification is designed primarily for learners between the ages of 14 and 16 and builds on the conceptual understanding learners have developed through their learning from ages 3 – 14.

The qualification allows learners to develop a strong foundation of knowledge, skills and understanding which supports progression to post-16 study and prepares learners for life, learning and work. The qualification provides a suitable foundation for the study of Music at either AS or A level. In addition, the specification provides a coherent, satisfying and worthwhile course of study for learners who do not progress to further study in this subject.

### <span id="page-7-1"></span>1.4 Guided learning hours

GCSE Music has been designed to be delivered within 120 – 140 guided learning hours. The qualification has been primarily designed as a 2-year programme for learners in years 10 and 11.

<span id="page-7-3"></span><sup>2</sup> <https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/principles-of-progression/>

<span id="page-7-4"></span><sup>3</sup> [https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/designing-your-curriculum/#specific](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area)[considerations-for-this-area](https://hwb.gov.wales/curriculum-for-wales/expressive-arts/designing-your-curriculum/#specific-considerations-for-this-area)

{8}------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="page-8-0"></span>1.5 Use of language

As our understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion evolves, so must our language. Updated terminology better reflects individual identities and fosters respect and accuracy. Language used should be specific as possible. Staying informed and adaptable is crucial, as inclusive language promotes dignity and equity. Recognising that language will continue to evolve, we will remain open to further amendments to ensure it accurately represents and supports all individuals. WJEC will inform centres of any amendments and the most up to date version of the specification will always be on the website.

#### <span id="page-8-1"></span>1.6 Equality and fair access

The specification may be followed by any learner, irrespective of gender, ethnic, religious or cultural background. It has been designed to avoid, where possible, features that could, without justification, make it more difficult for a learner to access and achieve because they have a particular protected characteristic.

The protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 are age, disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.

Access arrangements and reasonable adjustments are made for eligible learners to enable them to access the assessments and demonstrate their knowledge and skills without changing the demands of the assessment.

Information on access arrangements and reasonable adjustments is found in the following document from the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ): Access Arrangements, Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational Qualifications. This document is available on the JCQ website [\(www.jcq.org.uk\)](https://www.jcq.org.uk/).

We will be following the principles set out in this document and, as a consequence of provision for reasonable adjustments, very few learners will encounter a complete barrier to any part of the assessment.

{9}------------------------------------------------

## <span id="page-9-0"></span>2 SUBJECT CONTENT AND INTEGRATION OF LEARNING EXPERIENCES AND SKILLS

This GCSE Music qualification is based on the study and application of the elements of music, as listed below:

- dynamics
- form and structure
- harmony
- melody and pitch
- performance techniques/articulation
- sonority/timbre
- tempo, rhythm and metre
- texture
- tonality.

These will be explored through all three units.

#### <span id="page-9-1"></span>How to read the amplification

The amplification provided in the right-hand column, titled 'Further Information' uses the following five stems:

- 'Learners should know' is used when learners are required to use direct recall.
- 'Learners should be aware of' is used when learners do not need to understand all aspects of the specified content in detail. Teachers should refer to Guidance for Teaching documents for further guidance on the depth and breadth to which this content should be taught.
- 'Learners should understand' is used when learners are required to demonstrate greater depth than straight identification or recall. For example, they can apply knowledge to familiar or unfamiliar contexts and can synthesise and evaluate information for a given purpose.
- 'Learners should be able to' is used when learners need to apply their knowledge and understanding to a practical situation or demonstrate application of practical skills and techniques.
- 'Learners are required to' is used to show the requirements of individual units.

The use of the word 'including' indicates that the specified content must be taught and could be subject to assessment.

The use of the words 'for example' or 'such as' indicates that the specified content is for guidance only, and alternative examples could be chosen.

{16}------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="page-16-0"></span>Opportunities for integration of learning experiences

The GCSE Music qualification generates opportunities for the following experiences to be developed (the experiences will not be directly assessed):

- experience professional performance(s) and/or workshops, either live or using digital resources, to include a range of settings
- experience recording and producing music using current technologies
- develop confidence in giving and receiving feedback, promoting independent thinking, originality and creative resilience
- take creative risks and experience improvisation as part of the creative process
- \*take part in some form of collaborative performance
- gain a basic awareness of ethical and legal considerations as appropriate.

\*Learners can choose to perform as part of an ensemble within Unit 1, however, the collaborative performance noted above is not linked to this performance option and is not assessed.

Further amplification of the opportunities to develop cross-cutting themes, cross-curricular skills and integral skills can be found in Appendix C. The Guidance for Teaching will include further information on the opportunities provided by the qualification for teachers/centres to integrate these learning experiences into delivery.

## <span id="page-17-0"></span>3 ASSESSMENT

#### <span id="page-17-1"></span>3.1 Assessment objectives and weightings

Below are the assessment objectives for this specification. Learners must:

#### **AO1**

Demonstrate and apply knowledge and understanding of a range of music

#### **AO2**

Develop and apply performance and/or realisation skills

#### **AO3**

Reflect on, analyse and evaluate their own work and the work of others

#### **AO4**

Create and develop ideas to communicate meaning in compositions

The table below shows the weighting of each assessment objective for each unit and for the qualification as a whole.

|                   | AO1 | AO2   | AO3   | AO4 | Total |
|-------------------|-----|-------|-------|-----|-------|
| Unit 1            | -   | 32.5% | -     | -   | 32.5% |
| Unit 2            | -   | -     | 2.5%  | 30% | 32.5% |
| Unit 3            | 20% | -     | 15%   | -   | 35%   |

{18}------------------------------------------------

#### <span id="page-18-0"></span>3.2 Overview of arrangements for non-examination assessment

#### **Unit 1: Overview**

For this assessment learners are required:

• to perform a minimum of **two** pieces of music giving a total performance time of 4-6 minutes (each piece should be a minimum of 1 minute).

#### Learners can:

- choose to perform solos or independent parts within ensembles, or a combination of both, in their chosen style(s) of music, without a conductor
- choose to perform on any instrument or voice, or use technology, or a combination of these
- choose to accompany themselves
- use a stimulus for improvisation
- use pre-recorded backing tracks, provided that they do not include the learner's part. Audible click tracks should be avoided
- submit up to 4 pieces to meet the time requirement
- add repeats to a performance if they are not marked, but these should make musical sense
- perform sections of a piece or make cuts if these make musical sense.

Learners may perform at any time during the GCSE course. However, centres should ensure that assessment is completed only when learners have undertaken the necessary teaching and learning and developed the required skills and knowledge.

The assessment contributes to 32.5% of the overall qualification and has a recommended teaching time of 39 hours which should incorporate exploring, teaching and learning, rehearsing, performing and reflecting. The unit will be marked out of a total of 78 marks.

This unit will be assessed by the centre and externally moderated by WJEC.

#### **Unit 2: Overview**

For this assessment learners are required to:

- compose **two** original pieces of music with a recommended total duration of between 3-6 minutes, **one** in response to their own devised brief and **one** in response to a brief set by WJEC
- present a reflective log based on the compositional process of **either** the composition in response to their own devised brief, **or** the composition based on the brief set by WJEC.

Learners may compose at any time during the GCSE course. However, centres should ensure that assessment is completed only when learners have undertaken the necessary teaching and learning, and developed the required skills and knowledge.

The assessment contributes to 32.5% of the overall qualification and has a recommended teaching time of 39 hours which should incorporate exploring, teaching and learning, creating and reflecting. The unit will be marked out of a total of 78 marks.

{19}------------------------------------------------

The set briefs will be released on the WJEC Portal during the September of the first year of study.

This unit will be assessed by the centre and externally moderated by WJEC.

{20}------------------------------------------------

## <span id="page-20-0"></span>4 MALPRACTICE

Before the course starts, the teacher is responsible for informing candidates of WJEC's regulations concerning malpractice. Candidates must not take part in any unfair practice in the preparation of work for GCSE Music.

Information regarding malpractice is available in our [Guide to preventing, reporting](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)  [and investigating malpractice.](https://www.wjec.co.uk/media/0pjats1l/guide-to-preventing-reporting-and-investigating-malpractice-april-2022-002.pdf)

All cases of suspected or actual malpractice must be reported immediately to WJEC (malpractice@wjec.co.uk). If candidates commit malpractice, they may be penalised or disqualified from the examinations.

In all cases of malpractice, centres are advised to consult the JCQ booklet [Suspected Malpractice: Policies and Procedures.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice)

{21}------------------------------------------------

## <span id="page-21-0"></span>5 TECHNICAL INFORMATION

#### <span id="page-21-1"></span>5.1 Making entries

This is a linear qualification in which all assessments must be taken at the end of the course. Non-examination assessment units can be completed earlier in the course but must be submitted at the end of the course.

Assessment opportunities will be available in the summer series until the end of the life of this specification. Summer 2027 will be the first assessment opportunity.

A qualification may be taken more than once.

Learners who resit the examination unit can carry forward the marks they received for non-examination assessment units from the first time they attempted the qualification.

Marks for non-examination assessment (NEA) may be carried forward for the life of the specification. If a candidate resits an NEA unit (rather than carrying forward the previous NEA mark), it is the new mark that will count towards the overall grade, even if it is lower than a previous attempt (unless the mark is absent).

The entry code appears below.
