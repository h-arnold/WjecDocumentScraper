## <span id="page-5-0"></span>Task

### Learners are required to:

• perform a minimum of **two** pieces of music giving a total performance time of 4-6 mins (each piece should be a minimum of 1 minute).

#### Learners can:

- choose to perform solos **or** independent parts within ensembles, or a combination of both, in their chosen style(s) of music, without a conductor
- choose to perform on any instrument or voice, or use technology, or a combination of these
- choose to accompany themselves
- use a stimulus for improvisation
- use pre-recorded backing tracks, provided that they do not include the learner's part. Audible click tracks should be avoided
- submit up to 4 pieces to meet the time requirement
- add repeats to a performance if they are not marked, but these should make musical sense
- perform sections of a piece or make cuts if these make musical sense.

## Supervision

• No formal supervision.

## Monitoring

- There is no restriction on the amount of time learners spend on this unit.
- Teachers may provide guidance and support to learners to ensure that they have a clear understanding of the requirements and the assessment grid.

{7}------------------------------------------------

## <span id="page-6-0"></span>Further Information

#### **Standard of Pieces**

The standard of pieces selected for performance should be broadly equivalent to **Grade 3** of the graded music examinations. Pages 23-30 of this assessment pack contains descriptions of the levels of difficulty for the range of performances accepted in this qualification. This guidance must be followed when playing pieces **not** listed for graded music examinations. Centres should contact WJEC for advice if they are unable to make a judgement or if a learner wishes to offer a performance not covered by the tables.

#### **Improvisation**

Learners may choose to perform an improvisation to a **stimulus** of their own choice for a solo performance or as part of an ensemble. This may be prepared in advance of the practical assessment or improvised in performance (a stimulus may be a chord sequence, a scale etc.). **A copy of the musical stimulus must be provided for the assessor along with a lead sheet outlining the structure of the intended performance and any performance directions.** The level of difficulty will depend on the content of the improvisation performed.

#### **Performing and Recording**

Learners may perform at any time during the GCSE course. However, centres should ensure that assessment is completed only when learners have undertaken the necessary teaching and learning and developed the required skills and knowledge. Learners do not have to perform all pieces on the same day.

The assessor **must** be present for the recording of all performances, so that the work can be authenticated and is therefore deemed to be an audience member for each performance. Each piece may be performed on different occasions during the GCSE course or, alternatively, they may all be performed on one occasion.

Each piece **must** be recorded separately in **one unedited attempt**. It is not permissible to perform different sections of the same piece on different days. Second or subsequent attempts are permitted, but the learner must perform the whole piece again.

The recording **must not** be edited after the performance, and unless they are part of a music technology performance there must be no use or addition of effects.

All performances must be kept securely by the centre.

#### **Authentication**

All learners are required to sign a Candidate Declaration form (please see Appendix A on page 4 of the candidate pack) endorsing the performance as their own work and centres must countersign that they have taken all reasonable steps to validate this.

#### **Further information**

You should refer to the JCQ Instructions for conducting non-examination assessment for further information on managing assessment within our GCSE Qualifications.

{8}------------------------------------------------

## <span id="page-7-0"></span>Assessment (and calculating the final mark)

The total mark for this unit is 78.

Each piece performed should be marked out of 39. Learners must submit at least 2 pieces, which are individually marked out of 39.

When more than two pieces are offered, the total mark is divided by the number of pieces and multiplied by two, to achieve a final mark out of 78.

For example, (three pieces submitted):

36+30+34 = 100

100/3 = 33.3

33.3 x 2 = 66.6 (round up if 0.5 or above)

Final mark = 67

If the learner only submits 1 piece as part of their portfolio, the second, missing piece is awarded 0 marks. A timing penalty should also be applied if the submission is below 4 minutes.

#### For each performance:

- the appropriate band for each column should be established by determining which performance descriptor best reflects the learner's performance
- the appropriate mark within the band should then be established by determining the extent to which the learner has met the criteria within the relevant band
- the total marks for each performance may reflect different bands across the assessment criteria, for example, a learner may achieve band 4 in column 1, band 4 in column 2 and band 3 in column 3.

It should be noted that the bands have been designed to assist the marking process by identifying individual levels of achievement and they do not correlate with grade boundaries.

Learners who perform pieces that are significantly below the standard difficulty level for this specification (which is Grade 3) may not demonstrate sufficient skills to meet the criteria in the upper marking bands.

{9}------------------------------------------------

#### **Criteria for Assessment of Solo, Ensemble and Technology-Based Performance**

There are criteria for assessment of solo, ensemble and technology-based performances. Centres should use the appropriate criteria to assess each performance.

Performing an ensemble is not compulsory, however learners may choose to perform one or more ensemble pieces.

It is important to recognise which criteria should be applied to each performance, so the following guidance will aid teachers in making that judgement.

#### **Solo Performance**

If there is only one live performer, this is a solo

- a solo performance may be **either** accompanied **or** unaccompanied
- the accompaniment can be live or a backing track
- the accompanist need not be taking the assessment
- the score of the accompaniment need not be submitted.

#### **Ensemble Performance**

An ensemble performance may be on any instrument, voice, or technology-based option. In an ensemble, the learner is required to:

- perform in a group of between **two** and **eight** live performers. The other members of the ensemble need not be taking the assessment
- perform a significant **individual** part which is **not** doubled, at the same time as other member(s) of the ensemble
- perform accompanied **or** unaccompanied as part of a group but **not** be conducted (the accompaniment can be live **or** a backing track). An accompanist should not take the total number of live performers above eight.
- accompanying a solo is an acceptable ensemble when the **learner is the accompanist**  but not when the learner is the soloist.

Where there is an element of doubt concerning whether a piece is an ensemble, centres should contact WJEC for advice.

#### **Technology-based Performance**

Learners may choose to offer a technology-based performance for this unit. Technologybased performances include:

- DJ-ing
- 'push-units'
- sequencing
- use of loop stations
- other appropriate technology-based formats.

If in any doubt as to whether the form chosen is appropriate, please contact WJEC for advice. Note that it will be necessary to submit the score and/or lead sheet from which the learner performed/realised the piece.

{10}------------------------------------------------

#### **Guidance for Assessment**

There are performing assessment grids for different types of performance:

- Solo Performance (pages 9-11)
- Ensemble Performance (pages 12-15)
- Music Technology (pages 16-19)

There are 3 columns in each grid. In each grid, column 1 (Accuracy) and column 2 (Technical Control) are the same. However, column 3 reflects the different skills being assessed within the three different types of performance.

#### For each performance:

- the appropriate band for each column should be established by determining which descriptor best reflects the learner's performance
- the appropriate mark within the band should then be established by determining the extent to which the learner has met the criteria within the relevant band
- the marks in each column may reflect different bands across the assessment criteria, for example, a learner may achieve band 4 in column 1, band 3 in column 2 and band 2 in column 3.

It should be noted that the bands have been designed to assist the marking process by identifying individual levels of achievement and they do not correlate with grade boundaries.

#### **Column 1 – Accuracy**

All learners are assessed on accuracy of rhythm and/or pitch, as appropriate, in relation to a notated score. Where no score is available, the centre is expected to provide a detailed lead sheet including chords, melody (rhythm and pitch), lyrics (if appropriate), tempo and performance directions.

An "audio guide" or "reference track" will not be acceptable in lieu of a score as this does not offer a fair assessment for all learners.

Where learners plan to add embellishments, this should be noted on the score or lead sheet in advance of the performance. When assessing accuracy of these performances against a lead sheet, assessors will use their professional judgement to judge the accuracy of the performance within the stylistic context, considering such factors as the maintenance of the pulse and intonation.

In performances where it may not be possible to provide details of melody and chords on a lead sheet (for example, beat-box, DJ, or rap), centres must provide appropriate details of rhythm, tempo and performance directions/techniques, with timings as necessary, to allow for a fair assessment of their accuracy. In such performances, learners will be assessed on their ability to keep time with a backing track, make smooth transitions, keep an appropriate tempo/timing, and follow performance and technique directions, as appropriate to the piece.

Learners offering **improvisation** will be assessed on whether they are playing accurately within the stated stimulus and the lead sheet, for example, whether the performance fits the chord progression or uses the notes of the chosen scale, as well as if they are maintaining the tempo and pulse.

All learners are assessed on their ability to perform fluently and at an appropriate tempo throughout the piece.

{11}------------------------------------------------

All learners are assessed on their ability to follow performing/technique directions, accurately and appropriately throughout the piece.

#### **Column 2: Technical Control**

#### **Control of playing Instrumental technique / Vocal technique / Realisation technique**

The first bullet point on the assessment grid assesses the learner's ability to control instrumental/vocal technique or technical equipment, to meet the demands of the music they are performing. Assessors must consider how well **relevant** techniques are used within the performance, as appropriate to the style of the music. Centres should contact WJEC for advice if they are unsure about the use of a particular technique.

#### **Intonation (where appropriate)**

The second bullet point on the assessment grid assesses the learner's ability to control the intonation of the instrument, equipment, or voice to meet the demands of the piece they are performing. Learners need to be aware of their intonation throughout a performance and potentially make adjustments to ensure that notes are in tune.

#### **Control of timbre (tone quality)**

The third bullet point on the assessment grid assesses the learner's ability to **control** the timbre and tone quality of the instrument, equipment, or voice in the performance. This includes the learner's ability to affect and vary the tone quality during the piece, as appropriate to the style of the music. Assessors must consider the following as appropriate to the piece and instrument/voice/equipment (this list is not exhaustive, and learners do not need to cover all points in a performance):

- how well the tone quality is controlled across the range of the instrument, equipment, or voice
- the ability to sustain tone quality throughout the performance
- the use of tone quality as appropriate to the style of the piece
- the ability to vary the tone quality as appropriate to the piece and realise the performance markings
- the use of appropriate articulation/techniques
- the choice and mix of sound sources
- the use of effects to manipulate timbre
- the use of amplification.

{12}------------------------------------------------

#### **Column 3: Expression (solo performances)**

All learners are assessed on their ability to communicate a performance to the audience. Assessors should consider the following when assessing expression:

- the style of the music being performed, including performance conventions and consistency of style
- the ability of the learner to sustain the rapport with the audience throughout the performance, including the ability to communicate musically, shaping the performance using the elements of music
- the ability of the learner to work effectively with an accompanist or pre-recorded tracks if included
- the ability of the learner to project their performance.

#### **Column 3: Ensemble skills (ensemble performances)**

All learners are assessed on their ability to communicate a performance to the audience. Assessors should consider the following when assessing expression:

- the style of the music being performed, including performance conventions and consistency of style
- the ability of the learner to sustain the rapport with the audience throughout the performance, including the ability to communicate musically, shaping the performance using the elements of music
- the ability of the learner to work effectively with other performers and pre-recorded tracks if a backing track is included
- the ability of the learner to project a balanced ensemble performance.

### **Column 3: Mixing and Mastering (Music Technology)**

All learners are assessed on their ability to communicate a performance to the audience. Assessors should consider the following when assessing expression:

- the style of the music being performed, including performance conventions and consistency of style
- the ability of the learner to sustain the rapport with the audience throughout the performance, including the ability to communicate musically, shaping the performance etc. using the elements of music and music technology
- the ability of the learner to work effectively with live/pre-recorded tracks
- the ability of the learner to successfully mix and master their tracks
- the ability of the learner to project a balanced music technology performance.

## <span id="page-23-0"></span>Table of adjustments for level of difficulty of pieces

The GCSE music performing standard is broadly equivalent to Grade 3 in the graded music examinations. The total raw mark for **each** piece must be adjusted according to the difficulty of the piece, as noted in the table below.

#### **Level of difficulty of pieces performed**

All pieces which are listed on an accredited graded music examination syllabus will be accepted at that level **if** they are performed in full using the specified editions. The difficulty level of any **other** piece of music not contained in a graded music syllabus must be determined using the descriptors in the tables below. If a piece is edited to simplify or remove the more challenging sections, this will affect the level of difficulty.

The descriptors below are not exhaustive; neither will every piece contain all features listed, for example a Grade 3 standard oboe piece may cover a smaller range than a Grade 3 standard flute piece. When selecting the standard for each piece, teachers should use their professional judgement and look for the best fit.

Centres should contact WJEC for advice if the instrument or the features of a piece chosen for performance are not covered in the lists below or they are in doubt about the standard of a piece.

Centres should be aware that candidates must perform music at a difficulty level suitable for a KS4 course in music – a performance that cannot demonstrate sufficient skills or content will be unlikely to meet the criteria for credit. A piece which is significantly below Grade 3 standard will be unlikely to demonstrate evidence of the skills required to access marks in the higher bands of the assessment criteria.

#### **Further Information**

Learners are not restricted to one instrument/voice but there is no advantage to performing on a "second study". A learner who plays two instruments simultaneously, for example voice and guitar, may choose to be assessed on the voice only, the guitar only, or both. If a learner accompanies themself and chooses to be assessed on the whole performance, then the level of difficulty should also be considered holistically.

#### **A copy of the score or equivalent for all pieces must be provided for the assessor before the performance is recorded.**

This can be in stave notation, tab, or any other type of notation appropriate to the piece, and to allow a fair assessment of accuracy must include:

- the pitch and rhythm of the part performed by the learner
- performance directions.

If necessary, please provide a guide to interpretation. A transcription of a piece created by the learner or teacher in advance of the performance is acceptable. In the case of an improvisation a lead sheet and a copy of the stimulus should be provided. For a DJ performance, or a performance using technology such as a launchpad or loop station, a detailed and accurate lead sheet must be provided.

Centres should contact WJEC for advice about notation for specific types of performance not covered by the guidance above. An audio or video guide track will **not** be acceptable as an alternative to a score.

The suggested ranges in these descriptors will not apply equally to all brass and woodwind instruments. They show an increasing requirement from less difficult to more difficult which should be considered as part of the holistic, best fit judgement made. More information about the ranges expected at each Grade can be found in the ABRSM syllabus, available online. Other exam boards may publish similar guidance for their graded practical exams.

## Calculating the final mark for performances

All performances should be marked individually according to the criteria, and a total mark out of 78 calculated using the formula noted on page 4.

A piece which is significantly below the 1-minute minimum performance length will be unlikely to demonstrate evidence of the skills required to access marks in the higher bands of the assessment criteria.

The total time of the performances should also be calculated in minutes and seconds, and the following table used to determine the adjusted mark for performing, if the total time is less than 4 minutes. For example, a performance of 3 minutes and 50 seconds initially awarded a mark of 60 is given an adjusted mark of 56 because its duration falls within the 3:45 to 3:59 band.

The performance submission has a suggested maximum duration of 6 minutes. There is no penalty incurred for exceeding the time limit, and learners must submit at least 2 pieces, even if this goes beyond 6 minutes. Timing starts from the learner's first note and finishes after their final note. Centres need to be aware that long passages (e.g. introductions or instrumental verses) where the assessed learner is not performing, should not be counted in the timing.

Repeats can be added, but they must make musical sense and be marked clearly on the score before the performance.

Centres are responsible for assessing the performance and should listen to the entire submission. The moderator will listen for at least 6 minutes to inform their decisions on the accuracy of the centre assessment.

WJEC Music

<span id="page-41-0"></span>Candidate Assessment Pack

Unit 1: Performing (3630QSL-1)

{43}------------------------------------------------

## Information for Candidates

This pack is for candidates completing GCSE Music. It provides you with the information that you need to complete the non-examination assessments.

Within this pack, you will find details of:

- a breakdown of each task
- information for candidates, which tells you about things that you must and must not do when you are completing the assessment.

Your teacher is allowed to help you to understand the tasks, but there are rules about the kind of help and how much they can give you. You should speak to your teacher if you have any questions about what you are and are not allowed to do as you are completing the tasks, as they will know how much help they are allowed to give you.

You and your teacher will be required to sign a declaration that all work presented is your own work.

{44}------------------------------------------------

## **Unit 1**

#### Tasks

• perform a minimum of **two** pieces of music giving a total performance time of 4-6 minutes (each piece should be a minimum of 1 minute)

#### You can:

- choose to perform solos or independent parts within ensembles, or a combination of both, in your chosen style(s) of music, without a conductor
- choose to perform on any instrument or voice, or use technology, or a combination of these
- choose to accompany yourself (for example, if you choose to sing you can accompany yourself on the piano)
- use a stimulus for improvisation
- use pre-recorded backing tracks, provided that they do not include your part. Audible click tracks should be avoided
- submit up to 4 pieces to meet the time requirement
- add repeats to a performance if they are not marked, but these should make musical sense
- perform sections of a piece or make cuts if these make musical sense.

## Further Information

#### **Standard of Pieces**

The standard of pieces you and/or your teacher select for performance should be broadly equivalent to **Grade 3** of the graded music examinations.

#### **Improvisation**

You can choose to perform an improvisation to a **stimulus** of your own choice for a solo performance or as part of an ensemble. This can be prepared in advance of the assessment or improvised in performance (a stimulus may be a chord sequence, a scale etc.). If you choose to improvise, **a copy of the musical stimulus must be provided for the teacher/assessor along with a lead sheet outlining the structure of the intended performance and any performance directions.** The level of difficulty will depend on the content of the improvisation performed.

#### **Audience**

There is no requirement to perform in front of an audience other than the teacher who will be assessing you. You may choose to have a larger audience.

{45}------------------------------------------------

#### **Information for candidates**

The following information has been taken from the [JCQ Information for candidates](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) – non[examination assessments](https://www.jcq.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/IFC-NE_Assessments_2021_v4.pdf) and the [JCQ Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) Use in Assessments:](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/)  [Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications.](https://www.jcq.org.uk/exams-office/malpractice/artificial-intelligence/) This tells you about things that you **must** and **must not** do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not understand, you **must** ask your teacher.

#### **Preparing your work**

- When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you need to ensure that your final product reflects your own independent work and isn't copied or paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
- If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you **must** tell your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
- If you worked as part of a group on a task, you **must** each write up your own account of the assignment. Even if the data you have is the same, you **must** describe in your own words how that data was obtained, and you **must** independently draw your own conclusions from the data.
- Take care of your work and keep it safe. **Do not** leave it lying around where your classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You **must** always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; **do not** share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
- **Do not** be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI tools and chatbots) – this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort of copying.
- You **must not** write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

#### **Plagiarism**

Plagiarism involves taking someone else's words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them off as your own. **It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously.** Don't think you won't be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:

- Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
- Markers are highly experienced subject specialists they may have read the source you are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!
- Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and style of writing or punctuation.

#### **Penalties for breaking the regulations**

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be applied:

- the piece of work will be awarded zero marks
- you will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question
- you will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series
- you will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

**Remember – it's your qualification so it needs to be your own work.**

## Appendix D – Guide to Controls

Unit 1: Performing is internally assessed through NEA.

#### Controls are provided to:

- ensure that all candidates taking a specific qualification spend approximately the same amount of time on their assignments
- prevent third parties from providing inappropriate levels of guidance and input
- mitigate concerns about plagiarism and improve reliability and validity of results
- allow centres an appropriate degree of freedom and control
- allow candidates to produce an original piece of work.

There are a number of different aspects that are controlled within the internal assessment.

#### These are:

- supervision how closely candidates should be monitored as they carry out the tasks
- guidance how much help you are allowed to provide candidates as they are completing the tasks
- resources whether candidates are allowed access to any resources as they're completing the tasks and if so, what resources
- collaboration whether candidates are allowed to work with others as they're completing the tasks.

| Controls      | Unit 1: Performing |
|---------------|--------------------|
| Supervision   | No controls        |
| Guidance      | Permitted          |
| Resources     | No controls        |
| Collaboration | Permitted          |

{52}------------------------------------------------

## Supervision

Unit 1 has the following level of control.

| Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| None | Work may be completed outside of the centre without direct supervision. Where no supervision is specified, candidates may normally:have unlimited access to electronic and printed resourcesuse the internet without restrictionwork in groups.However, due to the nature of the assessment within Unit 2: Composing, candidates are not permitted to work in groups. |
