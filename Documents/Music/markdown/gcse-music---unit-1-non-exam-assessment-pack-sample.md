Task

Learners are required to:
•  perform a minimum of two pieces of music giving a total performance time of 4-6 mins

(each piece should be a minimum of 1 minute).

Learners can:
•  choose to perform solos or independent parts within ensembles, or a combination of

both, in their chosen style(s) of music, without a conductor

•  choose to perform on any instrument or voice, or use technology, or a combination of

these

•  choose to accompany themselves
•  use a stimulus for improvisation
•  use pre-recorded backing tracks, provided that they do not include the learner’s part.

Audible click tracks should be avoided

•  submit up to 4 pieces to meet the time requirement
•  add repeats to a performance if they are not marked, but these should make musical

sense

•  perform sections of a piece or make cuts if these make musical sense.

Supervision

•  No formal supervision.

Monitoring

•  There is no restriction on the amount of time learners spend on this unit.
•  Teachers may provide guidance and support to learners to ensure that they have a clear

understanding of the requirements and the assessment grid.

Further Information

Standard of Pieces

The standard of pieces selected for performance should be broadly equivalent to Grade 3 of
the graded music examinations. Pages 23-30 of this assessment pack contains descriptions
of the levels of difficulty for the range of performances accepted in this qualification. This
guidance must be followed when playing pieces not listed for graded music examinations.
Centres should contact WJEC for advice if they are unable to make a judgement or if a
learner wishes to offer a performance not covered by the tables.

Improvisation

Learners may choose to perform an improvisation to a stimulus of their own choice for a
solo performance or as part of an ensemble. This may be prepared in advance of the
practical assessment or improvised in performance (a stimulus may be a chord sequence, a
scale etc.). A copy of the musical stimulus must be provided for the assessor along
with a lead sheet outlining the structure of the intended performance and any
performance directions. The level of difficulty will depend on the content of the
improvisation performed.

Performing and Recording

Learners may perform at any time during the GCSE course. However, centres should
ensure that assessment is completed only when learners have undertaken the necessary
teaching and learning and developed the required skills and knowledge. Learners do not
have to perform all pieces on the same day.

The assessor must be present for the recording of all performances, so that the work can
be authenticated and is therefore deemed to be an audience member for each performance.
Each piece may be performed on different occasions during the GCSE course or,
alternatively, they may all be performed on one occasion.

Each piece must be recorded separately in one unedited attempt. It is not permissible to
perform different sections of the same piece on different days. Second or subsequent
attempts are permitted, but the learner must perform the whole piece again.

The recording must not be edited after the performance, and unless they are part of a
music technology performance there must be no use or addition of effects.

All performances must be kept securely by the centre.

Authentication

All learners are required to sign a Candidate Declaration form (please see Appendix A on
page 4 of the candidate pack) endorsing the performance as their own work and centres
must countersign that they have taken all reasonable steps to validate this.

Further information

You should refer to the JCQ Instructions for conducting non-examination assessment for
further information on managing assessment within our GCSE Qualifications.

Assessment (and calculating the final mark)

The total mark for this unit is 78.

Each piece performed should be marked out of 39. Learners must submit at least 2 pieces,
which are individually marked out of 39.

When more than two pieces are offered, the total mark is divided by the number of pieces
and multiplied by two, to achieve a final mark out of 78.
For example, (three pieces submitted):
36+30+34 = 100
100/3 = 33.3
33.3 x 2 = 66.6 (round up if 0.5 or above)
Final mark = 67

If the learner only submits 1 piece as part of their portfolio, the second, missing piece is
awarded 0 marks. A timing penalty should also be applied if the submission is below 4
minutes.

For each performance:
•

•

•

the appropriate band for each column should be established by determining which
performance descriptor best reflects the learner's performance
the appropriate mark within the band should then be established by determining the
extent to which the learner has met the criteria within the relevant band
the total marks for each performance may reflect different bands across the assessment
criteria, for example, a learner may achieve band 4 in column 1, band 4 in column 2 and
band 3 in column 3.

It should be noted that the bands have been designed to assist the marking process by
identifying individual levels of achievement and they do not correlate with grade boundaries.

Learners who perform pieces that are significantly below the standard difficulty level for this
specification (which is Grade 3) may not demonstrate sufficient skills to meet the criteria in
the upper marking bands.

Criteria for Assessment of Solo, Ensemble and Technology-Based Performance

There are criteria for assessment of solo, ensemble and technology-based performances.
Centres should use the appropriate criteria to assess each performance.

Performing an ensemble is not compulsory, however learners may choose to perform one or
more ensemble pieces.

It is important to recognise which criteria should be applied to each performance, so the
following guidance will aid teachers in making that judgement.

Solo Performance

If there is only one live performer, this is a solo
•  a solo performance may be either accompanied or unaccompanied
•
•
•

the accompaniment can be live or a backing track
the accompanist need not be taking the assessment
the score of the accompaniment need not be submitted.

Ensemble Performance

An ensemble performance may be on any instrument, voice, or technology-based option. In
an ensemble, the learner is required to:
•  perform in a group of between two and eight live performers. The other members of the

ensemble need not be taking the assessment

•  perform a significant individual part which is not doubled, at the same time as other

member(s) of the ensemble

•  perform accompanied or unaccompanied as part of a group but not be conducted (the

accompaniment can be live or a backing track). An accompanist should not take the total
number of live performers above eight.

•  accompanying a solo is an acceptable ensemble when the learner is the accompanist

but not when the learner is the soloist.

Where there is an element of doubt concerning whether a piece is an ensemble, centres
should contact WJEC for advice.

Technology-based Performance

Learners may choose to offer a technology-based performance for this unit. Technology-
based performances include:
•  DJ-ing
•
‘push-units’
•  sequencing
•  use of loop stations
•  other appropriate technology-based formats.

If in any doubt as to whether the form chosen is appropriate, please contact WJEC for
advice. Note that it will be necessary to submit the score and/or lead sheet from which
the learner performed/realised the piece.

Guidance for Assessment

There are performing assessment grids for different types of performance:
•  Solo Performance (pages 9-11)
•  Ensemble Performance (pages 12-15)
•  Music Technology (pages 16-19)

There are 3 columns in each grid. In each grid, column 1 (Accuracy) and column 2
(Technical Control) are the same. However, column 3 reflects the different skills being
assessed within the three different types of performance.

For each performance:
•

•

•

the appropriate band for each column should be established by determining which
descriptor best reflects the learner's performance
the appropriate mark within the band should then be established by determining the
extent to which the learner has met the criteria within the relevant band
the marks in each column may reflect different bands across the assessment criteria, for
example, a learner may achieve band 4 in column 1, band 3 in column 2 and band 2 in
column 3.

It should be noted that the bands have been designed to assist the marking process by
identifying individual levels of achievement and they do not correlate with grade boundaries.

Column 1 – Accuracy

All learners are assessed on accuracy of rhythm and/or pitch, as appropriate, in relation to a
notated score. Where no score is available, the centre is expected to provide a detailed lead
sheet including chords, melody (rhythm and pitch), lyrics (if appropriate), tempo and
performance directions.

An “audio guide” or “reference track” will not be acceptable in lieu of a score as this does not
offer a fair assessment for all learners.

Where learners plan to add embellishments, this should be noted on the score or lead sheet
in advance of the performance. When assessing accuracy of these performances against a
lead sheet, assessors will use their professional judgement to judge the accuracy of the
performance within the stylistic context, considering such factors as the maintenance of the
pulse and intonation.

In performances where it may not be possible to provide details of melody and chords on a
lead sheet (for example, beat-box, DJ, or rap), centres must provide appropriate details of
rhythm, tempo and performance directions/techniques, with timings as necessary, to allow
for a fair assessment of their accuracy. In such performances, learners will be assessed on
their ability to keep time with a backing track, make smooth transitions, keep an appropriate
tempo/timing, and follow performance and technique directions, as appropriate to the piece.

Learners offering improvisation will be assessed on whether they are playing accurately
within the stated stimulus and the lead sheet, for example, whether the performance fits the
chord progression or uses the notes of the chosen scale, as well as if they are maintaining
the tempo and pulse.

All learners are assessed on their ability to perform fluently and at an appropriate tempo
throughout the piece.

All learners are assessed on their ability to follow performing/technique directions, accurately
and appropriately throughout the piece.

Column 2: Technical Control

Control of playing Instrumental technique / Vocal technique / Realisation technique

The first bullet point on the assessment grid assesses the learner's ability to control
instrumental/vocal technique or technical equipment, to meet the demands of the music
they are performing. Assessors must consider how well relevant techniques are used
within the performance, as appropriate to the style of the music. Centres should contact
WJEC for advice if they are unsure about the use of a particular technique.

Intonation (where appropriate)

The second bullet point on the assessment grid assesses the learner’s ability to control the
intonation of the instrument, equipment, or voice to meet the demands of the piece they
are performing. Learners need to be aware of their intonation throughout a performance
and potentially make adjustments to ensure that notes are in tune.

Control of timbre (tone quality)

The third bullet point on the assessment grid assesses the learner's ability to control the
timbre and tone quality of the instrument, equipment, or voice in the performance. This
includes the learner's ability to affect and vary the tone quality during the piece, as
appropriate to the style of the music. Assessors must consider the following as appropriate
to the piece and instrument/voice/equipment (this list is not exhaustive, and learners do not
need to cover all points in a performance):
•  how well the tone quality is controlled across the range of the instrument, equipment, or

voice
the ability to sustain tone quality throughout the performance
the use of tone quality as appropriate to the style of the piece
the ability to vary the tone quality as appropriate to the piece and realise the
performance markings
the use of appropriate articulation/techniques
the choice and mix of sound sources
the use of effects to manipulate timbre
the use of amplification.

Column 3: Expression (solo performances)

All learners are assessed on their ability to communicate a performance to the audience.
Assessors should consider the following when assessing expression:
•

the style of the music being performed, including performance conventions and
consistency of style
the ability of the learner to sustain the rapport with the audience throughout the
performance, including the ability to communicate musically, shaping the performance
using the elements of music
the ability of the learner to work effectively with an accompanist or pre-recorded tracks if
included
the ability of the learner to project their performance.

•

•

•

Column 3: Ensemble skills (ensemble performances)

All learners are assessed on their ability to communicate a performance to the audience.
Assessors should consider the following when assessing expression:
•

the style of the music being performed, including performance conventions and
consistency of style
the ability of the learner to sustain the rapport with the audience throughout the
performance, including the ability to communicate musically, shaping the performance
using the elements of music
the ability of the learner to work effectively with other performers and pre-recorded tracks
if a backing track is included
the ability of the learner to project a balanced ensemble performance.

•

•

•

Column 3: Mixing and Mastering (Music Technology)

All learners are assessed on their ability to communicate a performance to the audience.
Assessors should consider the following when assessing expression:
•

the style of the music being performed, including performance conventions and
consistency of style
the ability of the learner to sustain the rapport with the audience throughout the
performance, including the ability to communicate musically, shaping the performance
etc. using the elements of music and music technology
the ability of the learner to work effectively with live/pre-recorded tracks
the ability of the learner to successfully mix and master their tracks
the ability of the learner to project a balanced music technology performance.

Table of adjustments for level of difficulty of pieces

The GCSE music performing standard is broadly equivalent to Grade 3 in the graded
music examinations. The total raw mark for each piece must be adjusted according to the
difficulty of the piece, as noted in the table below.

Level of difficulty of pieces performed

All pieces which are listed on an accredited graded music examination syllabus will be
accepted at that level if they are performed in full using the specified editions. The difficulty
level of any other piece of music not contained in a graded music syllabus must be
determined using the descriptors in the tables below. If a piece is edited to simplify or
remove the more challenging sections, this will affect the level of difficulty.

The descriptors below are not exhaustive; neither will every piece contain all features listed,
for example a Grade 3 standard oboe piece may cover a smaller range than a Grade 3
standard flute piece. When selecting the standard for each piece, teachers should use their
professional judgement and look for the best fit.

Centres should contact WJEC for advice if the instrument or the features of a piece chosen
for performance are not covered in the lists below or they are in doubt about the standard
of a piece.

Centres should be aware that candidates must perform music at a difficulty level suitable for
a KS4 course in music – a performance that cannot demonstrate sufficient skills or content
will be unlikely to meet the criteria for credit. A piece which is significantly below Grade 3
standard will be unlikely to demonstrate evidence of the skills required to access marks in
the higher bands of the assessment criteria.

Further Information

Learners are not restricted to one instrument/voice but there is no advantage to
performing on a “second study”. A learner who plays two instruments simultaneously,
for example voice and guitar, may choose to be assessed on the voice only, the guitar
only, or both. If a learner accompanies themself and chooses to be assessed on the
whole performance, then the level of difficulty should also be considered holistically.

A copy of the score or equivalent for all pieces must be provided for the assessor
before the performance is recorded.
This can be in stave notation, tab, or any other type of notation appropriate to the piece,
and to allow a fair assessment of accuracy must include:
•
•  performance directions.

the pitch and rhythm of the part performed by the learner

If necessary, please provide a guide to interpretation. A transcription of a piece created
by the learner or teacher in advance of the performance is acceptable. In the case of an
improvisation a lead sheet and a copy of the stimulus should be provided. For a DJ
performance, or a performance using technology such as a launchpad or loop station, a
detailed and accurate lead sheet must be provided.

Centres should contact WJEC for advice about notation for specific types of
performance not covered by the guidance above. An audio or video guide track will not
be acceptable as an alternative to a score.

Calculating the final mark for performances

All performances should be marked individually according to the criteria, and a total mark out of 78 calculated using the formula noted on page
4.

A piece which is significantly below the 1-minute minimum performance length will be unlikely to demonstrate evidence of the skills required to
access marks in the higher bands of the assessment criteria.

The total time of the performances should also be calculated in minutes and seconds, and the following table used to determine the adjusted
mark for performing, if the total time is less than 4 minutes. For example, a performance of 3 minutes and 50 seconds initially awarded a mark
of 60 is given an adjusted mark of 56 because its duration falls within the 3:45 to 3:59 band.

The performance submission has a suggested maximum duration of 6 minutes. There is no penalty incurred for exceeding the time limit,
and learners must submit at least 2 pieces, even if this goes beyond 6 minutes. Timing starts from the learner’s first note and finishes
after their final note. Centres need to be aware that long passages (e.g. introductions or instrumental verses) where the assessed learner
is not performing, should not be counted in the timing.

Repeats can be added, but they must make musical sense and be marked clearly on the score before the performance.

Centres are responsible for assessing the performance and should listen to the entire submission. The moderator will listen for at least 6
minutes to inform their decisions on the accuracy of the centre assessment.

Candidate Assessment Pack

Unit 1: Performing (3630QSL-1)

GCSE Music Unit 1 Performing

© WJEC CBAC Ltd. 2024

Information for Candidates

This pack is for candidates completing GCSE Music. It provides you with the information that
you need to complete the non-examination assessments.

Within this pack, you will find details of:
•  a breakdown of each task
•

information for candidates, which tells you about things that you must and must not do
when you are completing the assessment.

Your teacher is allowed to help you to understand the tasks, but there are rules about the
kind of help and how much they can give you. You should speak to your teacher if you have
any questions about what you are and are not allowed to do as you are completing the
tasks, as they will know how much help they are allowed to give you.

You and your teacher will be required to sign a declaration that all work presented is your
own work.

Unit 1

Tasks

•  perform a minimum of two pieces of music giving a total performance time of 4-6

minutes (each piece should be a minimum of 1 minute)

You can:
•  choose to perform solos or independent parts within ensembles, or a combination of

both, in your chosen style(s) of music, without a conductor

•  choose to perform on any instrument or voice, or use technology, or a combination of

these

•  choose to accompany yourself (for example, if you choose to sing you can accompany

yourself on the piano)

•  use a stimulus for improvisation
•  use pre-recorded backing tracks, provided that they do not include your part. Audible

click tracks should be avoided

•  submit up to 4 pieces to meet the time requirement
•  add repeats to a performance if they are not marked, but these should make musical

sense

•  perform sections of a piece or make cuts if these make musical sense.

Further Information

Standard of Pieces

The standard of pieces you and/or your teacher select for performance should be broadly
equivalent to Grade 3 of the graded music examinations.

Improvisation

You can choose to perform an improvisation to a stimulus of your own choice for a solo
performance or as part of an ensemble. This can be prepared in advance of the assessment
or improvised in performance (a stimulus may be a chord sequence, a scale etc.). If you
choose to improvise, a copy of the musical stimulus must be provided for the
teacher/assessor along with a lead sheet outlining the structure of the intended
performance and any performance directions. The level of difficulty will depend on the
content of the improvisation performed.

Audience

There is no requirement to perform in front of an audience other than the teacher who will be
assessing you. You may choose to have a larger audience.

Information for candidates

The following information has been taken from the JCQ Information for candidates – non-
examination assessments and the JCQ Artificial Intelligence (AI) Use in Assessments:
Protecting the Integrity of Qualifications. This tells you about things that you must and must
not do when you are completing your assessment. If there is anything that you do not
understand, you must ask your teacher.

Preparing your work

•  When you submit your work and sign your candidate declaration form, you need to

•

•

ensure that your final product reflects your own independent work and isn’t copied or
paraphrased from another source such as an AI tool.
If you receive help and guidance from someone other than your teacher, you must tell
your teacher who will then record the nature of the assistance given to you.
If you worked as part of a group on a task, you must each write up your own account of
the assignment. Even if the data you have is the same, you must describe in your own
words how that data was obtained, and you must independently draw your own
conclusions from the data.

•  Take care of your work and keep it safe. Do not leave it lying around where your

classmates can find it or share it with anyone, including posting it on social media. You
must always keep your work secure and confidential whilst you are preparing it; do not
share it with your classmates. If it is stored on the computer network, keep your
password secure. Collect all copies from the printer and destroy those you do not need.
•  Do not be tempted to use pre-prepared online solutions (such as those produced by AI

tools and chatbots) – this is cheating. Electronic tools used by WJEC can detect this sort
of copying.

•  You must not write inappropriate, offensive or obscene material.

Plagiarism

Plagiarism involves taking someone else’s words, thoughts or ideas and trying to pass them
off as your own. It is a form of cheating which is taken very seriously. Don’t think you
won’t be caught; there are many ways to detect plagiarism:
•  Markers can spot changes in the style of writing and use of language.
•  Markers are highly experienced subject specialists – they may have read the source you

•

are using, or even marked the work you have copied from!
Internet search engines and specialised computer software can be used to match
phrases or pieces of text with original sources and to detect changes in the grammar and
style of writing or punctuation.

Penalties for breaking the regulations

the piece of work will be awarded zero marks

If it is discovered that you have broken the regulations, one of the following penalties will be
applied:
•
•  you will be disqualified from that unit for the assessment series in question
•  you will be disqualified from the whole subject for that assessment series
•  you will be disqualified from all subjects and barred from entering again for a period of

time.

WJEC will decide which penalty is appropriate.

Remember – it’s your qualification so it needs to be your own work.

Unit 1: Performing is internally assessed through NEA.

Controls are provided to:
•  ensure that all candidates taking a specific qualification spend approximately the same

amount of time on their assignments

•  prevent third parties from providing inappropriate levels of guidance and input
•  mitigate concerns about plagiarism and improve reliability and validity of results
