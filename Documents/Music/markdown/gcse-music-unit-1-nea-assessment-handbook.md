Task

Learners are required to:
•  perform a minimum of  two pieces of music giving a total performance time of 4-6 mins

(each piece should be a minimum of 1 minute).

Learners can:
•  choose to perform solos or independent parts within ensembles, or a combination of

both, in their chosen style(s) of music, without a conductor

•  choose to perform on any instrument or voice, or use technology, or a combination of

these

•  choose to accompany themselves
•  use a stimulus for improvisation
•  use pre-recorded backing tracks, provided that they do not include the learner’s part.
add additional repeats to a performance to meet the time requirements, but these
•
should make musical sense
submit up to 4 pieces to meet the time requirement

•

Guidance:

•  Audible click tracks should be avoided
•
•
•  Perform sections of a piece or make cuts if these make musical sense
•  Any changes to the score should be clearly annotated before the performance is

recorded

•  Each piece must be recorded separately. The recordings can be made on different

occasions

Supervision:

•  There is no formal supervision required during preparation for the assessment
•  There is no restriction on the amount of time learners spend on this unit
•  The teacher assessor must be present when the performances are recorded
•  Teachers may provide guidance and support to learners to ensure that they have a clear

understanding of the requirements and the assessment criteria.

Submission:

Each candidate submission must include:
•  An mp3 audio file of each piece performed
•  A score or equivalent of each piece performed
•  A declaration of authenticity signed by the candidate and the teacher, and a completed

mark sheet (please use the template on the website.)

Weighting:

•  There are 78 marks awarded in Unit 1
•  Unit 1 makes up 32.5% of the GCSE Music qualification.

Information for candidates

You should read the details of the task carefully and ask your teacher for any help you need
to understand what you need to do, and how your work will be assessed.

Suitability of pieces

You may choose the pieces you wish to perform. Your teacher will be able to advise you on
whether they are the most suitable. Here are some things to bear in mind:

•  The standard level for GCSE Music is equivalent to Grade 3
•  You can perform easier or more difficult pieces and be credited for these.
•  You can do all of your performances on one instrument, or you can submit a mixture of
instruments/voice/music technology performances. Each piece is assessed separately.
•  You can perform solo pieces or ensemble pieces, or a mixture of the two. An ensemble

should have no more than 8 live performers, and you should play a significant,
independent line, not doubled by anyone else.

•  You can perform an improvisation, based on a stimulus such as a chord sequence, a

melody, a scale etc.

•  You must not perform pieces with offensive lyrics, such as swearing, or references to

drugs, violence or any form of discrimination.

What you need to submit

For every piece you must have a score or leadsheet which shows the details of what you will
perform, so that you can be assessed for accuracy. Without this, there will not be the
evidence to award high marks.

Every piece must be recorded, and your teacher must be present. Only audio recordings are
required, not videos.

There is no written work in this unit.

You must sign a declaration to say that the recording submitted is actually you.

You can be recorded at any time during your GCSE course, up to the deadline set by your
teacher.

Information for teachers

Standard of Pieces

The standard of pieces selected for performance should be broadly equivalent to Grade 3 of
the graded music examinations. Pages 25-32 of this assessment handbook contain
descriptions of the levels of difficulty for the range of performances accepted in this
qualification. This guidance must be followed when playing pieces not listed for graded
music examinations. Centres should contact WJEC for advice if they are unable to make a
judgement or if a learner wishes to offer a performance not covered by the tables.

Improvisation

Learners may choose to perform an improvisation to a stimulus of their own choice for a
solo performance or as part of an ensemble. This may be prepared in advance of the
practical assessment or improvised in performance (a stimulus may be a chord sequence, a
scale etc.). A copy of the musical stimulus must be provided for the assessor along
with a lead sheet outlining the structure of the intended performance and any
performance directions. The level of difficulty will depend on the content of the
improvisation performed.

Performing and Recording

Learners may perform at any time during the GCSE course. However, centres should ensure
that assessment is completed only when learners have undertaken the necessary teaching
and learning and developed the required skills and knowledge. Learners do not have to
perform all pieces on the same day.

Each piece may be performed on different occasions during the GCSE course or,
alternatively, they may all be performed on one occasion.

Each piece must be recorded separately in one unedited attempt. It is not permissible to
perform different sections of the same piece on different days. Second or subsequent
attempts are permitted, but the learner must perform the whole piece again.

The recording must not be edited after the performance, and unless they are part of a music
technology performance there must be no use or addition of effects.

All performances must be kept securely by the centre.

Authentication

The assessor must be present for the recording of all performances, so that the work can be
authenticated. All learners are required to sign a Candidate Declaration form endorsing the
performance as their own work and centres must countersign that they have taken all
reasonable steps to validate this.

Further information

You should refer to the JCQ Instructions for conducting non-examination assessment for
further information on managing assessment within our GCSE Qualifications.

Scores

A copy of the score or equivalent for all pieces must be provided for the assessor before the
performance is recorded. This can be in stave notation, tab, or any other type of notation
appropriate to the piece, and to allow a fair assessment of accuracy must include:
•
•  performance directions.

the pitch and rhythm of the part performed by the learner

If necessary, please provide a guide to interpretation. A transcription of a piece created by
the learner or teacher in advance of the performance is acceptable. In the case of an
improvisation a lead sheet and a copy of the stimulus should be provided. For a DJ
performance, or a performance using technology such as a launchpad or loop station, a
detailed and accurate lead sheet must be provided. Centres should contact WJEC for advice
about notation for specific types of performance not covered by the guidance above. An
audio or video guide track will not be acceptable as an alternative to a score.

Timing

Candidates should perform pieces of at least one minute. A piece which is significantly below
the one minute minimum performance duration will be unlikely to demonstrate evidence of
the skills required to access marks in the higher bands of the assessment criteria.

The overall submission must be at least 4 minutes, or candidates will face a penalty. Each
piece should be timed separately, and then the total calculated. Timing starts from the
learner’s first note of the piece and finishes after their final note. Long passages (e.g.
introductions or instrumental verses) where the candidate is not performing, should not be
counted in the timing.

Repeats can be added, but they must make musical sense and be marked clearly on the
score before the performance.

The performance submission has a suggested maximum duration of 6 minutes. There is no
penalty incurred for exceeding the time limit, and learners must submit at least 2 pieces,
even if this goes beyond 6 minutes.

Unit 1 Performing Timing Sheet

Centres must submit a form containing details of the timings of all candidates’ performances
with the moderation sample. This form is available from the website and should be
completed with the details of every candidate and the total duration of their performing
submission, and any penalties imposed by the centre prior to submission. It will be used by
the moderator to check that penalties are correct.

Assessment (and calculating the final mark)

The total mark for this unit is 78. Each piece performed should be marked out of 39, using
the banded marking scheme on pages 13 onwards.

Learners must submit at least 2 pieces, which are individually marked out of 39.

The level of difficulty of each piece must be determined using the descriptors on pages 25
onwards, and the mark awarded for the performance must be scaled up (if it is more difficult
than Grade 3) or down (if it is easier than Grade 3) according to the table on pages 33-34 to
give a final mark for the performance.

When more than two pieces are performed, the total mark is divided by the number of pieces
and multiplied by two, to achieve a final mark out of 78. For example, (three pieces
submitted):

36+30+34 = 100
100/3 = 33.3
33.3 x 2 = 66.6 (round up if 0.5 or above)
Final mark = 67

If the learner only submits 1 piece as part of their portfolio, the second, missing piece is
awarded 0 marks.

A timing penalty should also be applied if a submission is below 4 minutes, using the table
on page 35.

The performance submission has a suggested maximum duration of 6 minutes. There is no
penalty incurred for exceeding the time limit, and learners must submit at least 2 pieces,
even if this goes beyond 6 minutes. Timing starts from the learner’s first note and finishes
after their final note. Centres need to be aware that long passages (e.g. introductions or
instrumental verses) where the assessed learner is not performing, should not be counted in
the timing.

Repeats can be added, but they must make musical sense and be marked clearly on the
score before the performance.

Centres are responsible for assessing the performance and should listen to the entire
submission. The moderator will listen for at least 6 minutes to inform their decisions on the
accuracy of the centre assessment.

For each performance:
•

•

•

the appropriate band for each column should be established by determining which
performance descriptor best reflects the learner's performance
the appropriate mark within the band should then be established by determining the
extent to which the learner has met the criteria within the relevant band
the marks awarded for each performance may reflect different bands across the
assessment criteria, for example, a learner may achieve band 4 in column 1, band 4 in
column 2 and band 3 in column 3.

•  any adjustment for level of difficulty should be applied to give a final mark for the

performance.

It should be noted that the bands have been designed to assist the marking process by
identifying individual levels of achievement and they do not correlate with grade boundaries.

Learners who perform pieces that are significantly below the standard difficulty level for this
specification (which is equivalent to Grade 3) may not demonstrate sufficient skills to meet
the criteria in the upper marking bands.

Criteria for Assessment of Solo, Ensemble and Technology-Based
Performance

There are criteria for assessment of solo, ensemble and technology-based performances.
Centres should use the appropriate criteria to assess each performance.

Performing an ensemble is not compulsory, however learners may choose to perform one or
more ensemble pieces.

Performing a solo is also not compulsory. A submission could be:
•  all solo
•  all ensemble
•  some solo and some ensemble
•  all technology based
•  all “traditional” performance (ie non-technology based)
•  some technology and some traditional performance(s)

It is important to recognise which criteria should be applied to each performance, so the
following guidance will aid teachers in making that judgement.

Solo Performance

If there is only one live performer, this is a solo
•  a solo performance may be either accompanied or unaccompanied
•
•
•

the accompaniment can be live or a backing track
the accompanist need not be taking the assessment
the score of the accompaniment need not be submitted

Ensemble Performance

An ensemble performance may be on any instrument, voice, or technology-based option. In
an ensemble, the learner is required to:
•  perform in a group of between two and eight live performers. The other members of the

ensemble need not be taking the assessment

•  perform a significant individual part which is not doubled, at the same time as other

member(s) of the ensemble

•  perform accompanied or unaccompanied as part of a group but not be conducted (the

accompaniment can be live or a backing track). An accompanist should not take the total
number of live performers above eight.

Accompanying a solo is an acceptable ensemble when the learner is the accompanist but
not when the learner is the soloist.

Technology-based Performance

Learners may choose to offer a technology-based performance for this unit. Technology-
based performances include:
•  DJ-ing
•
‘push-units’
•  sequencing
•  use of loop stations
•  other appropriate technology-based formats.

GCSE Music Unit 1: Performing NEA Handbook

Note that it will be necessary to submit the score and/or lead sheet from which the learner
performed/realised the piece.

Assessment Criteria

There are performing assessment grids for different types of performance:
•  Solo Performance
•  Ensemble Performance
•  Music Technology

The first two columns – Accuracy, and Technical Control - are the same in all three of the
grids.

Column 1 – Accuracy

All learners are assessed on accuracy of rhythm and/or pitch, as appropriate, in relation to a
notated score. Where no score is available, the centre is expected to provide a detailed lead
sheet including chords, melody (rhythm and pitch), lyrics (if appropriate), tempo and
performance directions.

An “audio guide” or “reference track” will not be acceptable in lieu of a score as this does not
offer a fair assessment for all learners.

Where learners plan to add embellishments, this should be noted on the score or lead sheet
in advance of the performance. When assessing accuracy of these performances against a
lead sheet, assessors will use their professional judgement to judge the accuracy of the
performance within the stylistic context, considering such factors as the maintenance of the
pulse and intonation.

In performances where it may not be possible to provide details of melody and chords on a
lead sheet (for example, beat-box, DJ, or rap), centres must provide appropriate details of
rhythm, tempo and performance directions/techniques, with timings as necessary, to allow
for a fair assessment of their accuracy. In such performances, learners will be assessed on
their ability to keep time with a backing track, make smooth transitions, keep an appropriate
tempo/timing, and follow performance and technique directions, as appropriate to the piece.

Learners offering improvisation will be assessed on whether they are playing accurately
within the stated stimulus and the lead sheet, for example, whether the performance fits the
chord progression or uses the notes of the chosen scale, as well as if they are maintaining
the tempo and pulse.

All learners are assessed on their ability to perform fluently and at an appropriate tempo
throughout the piece.

All learners are assessed on their ability to follow performing/technique directions, accurately
and appropriately throughout the piece.

Column 2: Technical Control

Control of playing Instrumental technique / Vocal technique / Realisation technique
The first bullet point on the assessment grid assesses the learner's ability to control
instrumental/vocal technique or technical equipment, to meet the demands of the music they
are performing. Assessors must consider how well relevant techniques are used within the
performance, as appropriate to the style of the music. Centres should contact WJEC for
advice if they are unsure about the use of a particular technique.

Intonation (where appropriate)
The second bullet point on the assessment grid assesses the learner’s ability to control the
intonation of the instrument, equipment, or voice to meet the demands of the piece they are
performing. Learners need to be aware of their intonation throughout a performance and
potentially make adjustments to ensure that notes are in tune.

Control of timbre (tone quality)
The third bullet point on the assessment grid assesses the learner's ability to control the
timbre and tone quality of the instrument, equipment, or voice in the performance. This
includes the learner's ability to affect and vary the tone quality during the piece, as
appropriate to the style of the music. Assessors must consider the following as appropriate
to the piece and instrument/voice/equipment (this list is not exhaustive, and learners do not
need to cover all points in a performance):
•  how well the tone quality is controlled across the range of the instrument, equipment, or

voice
the ability to sustain tone quality throughout the performance
the use of tone quality as appropriate to the style of the piece
the ability to vary the tone quality as appropriate to the piece and realise the
performance markings
the use of appropriate articulation/techniques
the choice and mix of sound sources
the use of effects to manipulate timbre
the use of amplification

•
•
•

•

•
•

Column 3: Expression (solo performances)

All learners are assessed on their ability to communicate a performance to the audience.
Assessors should consider the following when assessing expression:
•

the style of the music being performed, including performance conventions and
consistency of style
the ability of the learner to sustain the rapport with the audience throughout the
performance, including the ability to communicate musically, shaping the performance
using the elements of music
the ability of the learner to work effectively with an accompanist or pre-recorded tracks if
included
the ability of the learner to project their performance.

Column 3: Ensemble skills (ensemble performances)

All learners are assessed on their ability to communicate a performance to the audience.
Assessors should consider the following when assessing expression:
•

the style of the music being performed, including performance conventions and
consistency of style
the ability of the learner to sustain the rapport with the audience throughout the
performance, including the ability to communicate musically, shaping the performance
using the elements of music
the ability of the learner to work effectively with other performers and pre-recorded tracks
if a backing track is included
the ability of the learner to project a balanced ensemble performance

•

•

•

Column 3: Mixing and Mastering (Music Technology)

All learners are assessed on their ability to communicate a performance to the audience.
Assessors should consider the following when assessing expression:
•

the style of the music being performed, including performance conventions and
consistency of style
the ability of the learner to sustain the rapport with the audience throughout the
performance, including the ability to communicate musically, shaping the performance
etc. using the elements of music and music technology
the ability of the learner to work effectively with live/pre-recorded tracks
the ability of the learner to successfully mix and master their tracks
the ability of the learner to project a balanced music technology performance.

Levels of difficulty

All pieces which are listed on an accredited graded music examination syllabus will be
accepted at that level if they are performed in full using the specified editions. The
difficulty level of any other piece of music not contained in a graded music syllabus must be
determined using the descriptors in the tables on pages 25-32. If a piece is edited to simplify
or remove the more challenging sections, this will affect the level of difficulty.

The descriptors are not exhaustive; neither will every piece contain all features listed, for
example a Grade 3 standard oboe piece may cover a smaller range than a Grade 3 standard
flute piece. When selecting the standard for each piece, teachers should use their
professional judgement and look for the best fit.

Centres should be aware that candidates must perform music at a difficulty level suitable for
a KS4 course in music – a performance that cannot demonstrate sufficient skills or content
will be unlikely to meet the criteria for credit. A piece which is significantly below Grade 3
standard will be unlikely to demonstrate evidence of the skills required to access marks in
the higher bands of the assessment criteria.

Timing Penalties

The total time of the performances should also be calculated in minutes and seconds, and the following table used to determine the adjusted
mark for performing, if the total time is less than 4 minutes. For example, a performance of 3 minutes and 50 seconds initially awarded a mark
of 60 is given an adjusted mark of 56 because its duration falls within the 3:45 to 3:59 band. There is no penalty for a submission which is over
6 minutes long.
