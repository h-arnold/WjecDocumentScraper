MARK SCHEME

Guidance for examiners

Generic marking principles

•  Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions).

•  Answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar

when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark
scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.

•  Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for
the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the
quality of the candidate responses seen).

•  Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme.
Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

Positive marking

It should be remembered that candidates are writing under examination conditions and credit
should be given for what the candidate writes, rather than adopting the approach of
penalising candidates for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to
achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be
deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.

For questions that are objective or points-based, the mark scheme should be applied
precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.

Mark schemes often list points which may be included in candidates’ answers. The list is not
exhaustive. The inclusion of ‘Credit any other valid response.’ (or similar instruction) within
mark schemes allows for the possible variation in candidates’ responses. Credit should be
given according to the accuracy and relevance of candidates’ answers.

Appropriate terminology is reflected in exemplar responses in mark schemes. However,
unless there is a specific requirement within a question, candidates may be awarded marks
where the answer is accurate but expressed in their own words.

Banded mark schemes

For band marked questions mark schemes are in two parts; the indicative content and the
assessment grid.

The indicative content suggests the range of points and issues which may be included in
candidates’ answers.  It can be used to assess the quality of the candidate’s response. As
noted above, indicative content is not intended to be exhaustive and candidates do not have
to include all the indicative content to reach the highest level of the mark scheme.

However, to reach the highest level of the mark scheme a candidate must meet the
requirements of the highest mark band.  Where a response is not creditworthy, that is, it
contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been
provided, no marks should be awarded.

The marking of banded mark questions should always be positive. This means that, for each
candidate’s response, marks are accumulated for the demonstration of relevant skills,
knowledge and understanding: they are not deducted from a maximum on the basis of errors
or omissions.

Examiners should first read and annotate the candidate’s answer to pick out the evidence
that is being assessed in that question. The mark scheme can then be applied. This is done
as a two-stage process.

Stage 1 – Deciding on the band

Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the candidate’s answer and check
whether it matches the descriptors for that band.  If the descriptors at the lowest band are
satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band
until the descriptors most closely matches the work.

Stage 2 – Deciding on the mark

Having determined the appropriate band, deciding on the mark within a band will be made
on the basis of a ‘best fit’ procedure, weaknesses in some areas being compensated for by
strengths in others.

Examiners should use the full range of marks available to them. Marking should be positive,
rewarding achievement rather that penalising failure or omissions. The awarding of marks
must be directly related to the marking criteria, and all responses must be marked according
to the banded levels provided for each question.

Standardising material that has already been awarded a mark will be provided during
standardising and this should be used as a reference material when assessing work.
Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the standardising material as they apply the
mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the
work submitted.

This mark scheme instructs examiners to look for and reward valid alternatives where
indicative content is suggested for an answer. This is not a checklist for expected content in
an answer, or set out as a 'model answer', as responses must be marked in the banded
levels of response provided for each question. Where a candidate provides a response that
contains aspects or approaches not included in the indicative content, examiners should use
their professional judgement to determine the validity of the response in light of the task and
reward as directed by the bands. Candidates are free to choose any approach that is
relevant to the set task. Candidates can (and will most likely) incorporate ideas other than
those mentioned in the mark scheme.

Question  Answer

6.

Select five musical elements from the list below and explain how the composer uses
them to create a feeling of tension and conflict.

•  melody
•  harmony
tonality
•
form and structure
•
•  dynamics
timbre
•
texture
•
tempo
•
•
rhythm
•  metre.

You should use accurate musical vocabulary to support your answer.

Indicative Content

Melody:
•  Melodic ideas consist of 3 main ideas – opening choral section melody is mostly disjunct

and harmonic content is more important than melody.
•  Melody of ostinato conjunct /scalic/ ascending/ descending.
•  Countermelody is conjunct / scalic / ascending with prominent interval of a falling 5th.

Repetitive, ostinato builds with added thirds, changes according to the harmony with some
variations.

•  Choral setting homophonic and syllabic.

Harmony:
•  Choral section based on tonic (E minor) and dominant (B minor) begins with open /parallel

chords, but some dissonance added when choral section is added to the ostinato. End of
first choral section on C minor chord (adds to the feeling of tension as it is unexpected) –
diminished chords.

Tonality:
•  Minor (E minor) modulates to G minor.

Form and Structure:
•  3 main sections – opening choral section, introduction of 1st theme (Ostinato) then Counter

Melody (in Horns).

•  Motifs are combined (Choral and Orchestral) for final section, ostinato becomes
backbone/signature motive from the outset and builds with added orchestration
throughout.

Dynamics:
•  Opening Forte, 1st section Piano, gradual build – crescendo as instruments are added to

the ostinato, ending is fortissimo and dramatic climax at the end of the excerpt.

Timbre:
•  Scored for SATB Choir and Orchestra – harp glissandi and brass are increasingly more

important.

•  Use of timpani adds drama and tam tam.
•

Instruments are quite dark in timbre to begin with, clarinet, bass clarinet, Cor Anglais,
Basoon.

•  Flutes (piccolo later), horns and trumpets are added.
•  Some trumpet stabs + fanfare like figures, chimes and glock.

Texture:
•  Homophonic unaccompanied choral opening.
•  Texture thickens.
•

Imitation (polyphonic texture) of 2nd theme between horns and trombones.

Tempo:
•  Opening Maestoso (66bpm).
•  Gets faster when ostinato is introduced – allegro 160bpm.

Rhythm:
•  Constant use of orchestral ostinato – opening vocal rhythm is syncopated and syllabic

– words are used for dramatic vocal effect and have no meaning.

Metre:
•  Constant metre of simple quadruple.

Credit any other valid response.

NB. The response should link the use of the elements of music to the feeling of tension and
conflict.

Appendix A – WJEC Music Digital Assessment

Digital Assessment Information

1.  Arrangements and access of the digital examination:

Digital examinations will be delivered to centres through Surpass software. An
application named WJEC SecureClient will need to be installed on candidate’s PC’s
within centres so that candidates can complete the exams. The Surpass software will be
available throughout the academic year and centres will be encouraged to complete
practice exams (e.g. Digital Specimen Assessment Materials and past papers as they
become available) using the on-screen assessment software so that candidates can
familiarise themselves with the software in readiness for the live exams.

2.  Controls within digital examination:

Centre staff will need to:
•  modify the duration of on-screen exams for candidates that require additional time

(access arrangements)

•  ensure invigilators can log into Surpass to be able to pause and resume exams

during the delivery of on-screen exams. Used for candidates who have supervised
rest breaks (access arrangements) and for individual or cohort issues that may occur
during live exams e.g. disruption.

Candidates will have the ability to:
•  change the colour preferences of the on-screen exam.
•  zoom in/out functionality.

3.  Candidate instructions for digital examinations:

Centres will be provided with a Candidate User Guide for candidates completing on-
screen assessments. The Surpass software will be available throughout the academic
year and centres will be encouraged to complete practice exams (e.g. Digital Specimen
Assessment Materials and past papers as they become available) using the on-screen
assessment software so that candidates can familiarise themselves with the software in
readiness for the live exams.

4.  Digital examination arrangements – clarity over support:

Live exams will be scheduled by WJEC at least 7 days before the date of the exam. The
‘Home ’screen of Surpass will contain information to assist with the installation and
testing of the software as well as a user guide detailing the administration process of
delivering on-screen exams within a centre.
