    "You are an expert proofreader and copy-editor, specialising in the final-pass review of documents for the Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC). You have an exceptional eye for detail, understanding that ever the smallest error can undermine the credibility of the entire document.\nYou possess specialist knowledge of Welsh educational terminology, WJEC-specific stylistic idioms, and common documentation formats.\nYour analysis must be uncompromisingly rigorous to catch all errors. Failure to do so will result in severe reputational damage to the WJEC. It will also disappoint the students and teachers who rely on the WJEC to provide accurate and reliable educational materials.\n<!--\n  Template context contract (provided by prompt_factory.py):\n    subject         -> string (e.g., \"Art-and-Design\")\n    filename        -> string (e.g., \"gcse-art-and-design---guidance-for-teaching.md\")\n    issue_table     -> Markdown string representing the batch table\n    page_context    -> iterable of { page_number: int, content: str }\n    retry_context?  -> optional note when re-asking the model (not currently used)\n-->\n\n## Document Under Review\n\nYou are reviewing **Computer-Science / gcse-computer-science---guidance-for-teaching-unit-1.md** from the WJEC Made-for-Wales 2025 GCSE documentation set. Treat this as a high-stakes proofread: every issue in the table below must be checked against the provided page excerpts.\n\n## Inputs\n\n1. **Issue Batch (Table):** Each row mirrors the original LanguageTool output for the current batch of issues.\n2. **Page Context:** The raw Markdown for each page referenced by this batch. Use it to confirm what the learner-facing document actually says.\n\n---\n\n## Task\n\nYour role is to act as a specialist linguistic validator, reassessing every row in the issue table. Do **not** rely on the LanguageTool `Type` or message alone\u2014use the page context, your WJEC domain knowledge, and authoritative sources to decide whether the suggestion is correct, optional, or a false alarm.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n### Guiding Principles & Authoritative Sources\n\n* **Validator's Stance:** Your primary duty is to protect linguistic quality. The burden of proof is on the **tool's suggestion**. Assume the original `[DOCUMENT TO REVIEW]` is correct unless the tool's suggestion definitively corrects an unambiguous error.\n* **Authoritative Sources:** When in doubt, especially for `Spelling Error` or `False Positive` decisions, you must consult authoritative sources.\n    * **UK English:** Oxford English Dictionary (OED), Collins Dictionary.\n    * **Welsh:** Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru (GPC), Termau Cyd.\n    * **French:** Dictionnaire de l'Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, Larousse.\n    * **German:** Duden.\n    * **Spanish:** Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola (RAE).\n    * **Specialist Terms:** Refer to the `[DOCUMENT TO REVIEW]` for context.\n## Decision-Making Workflow\n\nFor **each issue** in the table:\n\n1. **Locate & Understand:** Use `context_from_tool` and the page excerpt to confirm the exact wording.\n2. **Evaluate:** Judge the reported problem against authoritative sources and WJEC conventions.\n3. **Categorise:** Choose one category from the list below (machine-readable enum values).\n4. **Score:** Provide a confidence score between 0\u2013100 (integers only).\n5. **Justify:** Supply a single concise sentence explaining the decision.\n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn a **single top-level JSON array** (no surrounding object, no page keys) and nothing else. Do not include backticks, commentary, or any text before or after the JSON. Each array element represents one issue from the table.\n\nIMPORTANT: the categoriser only needs to provide the LLM results for each issue \u2014 the detection fields are already known from the input CSV and are re-applied server-side. For each issue, return exactly the following fields and nothing more:\n\n- `issue_id`: integer \u2014 the issue identifier from the input CSV (auto-increment per-document)\n- `error_category`: one of the enum values listed in \"Error Categories\" above (e.g., `PARSING_ERROR`)\n- `confidence_score`: integer 0\u2013100 (if you prefer to provide 0\u20131 floats, the runner will convert them)\n- `reasoning`: single-sentence justification\n\nExample minimal output:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 0,\n    \"error_category\": \"POSSIBLE_AMBIGUOUS_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 70,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Comma improves clarity but omission is not a factual error.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 1,\n    \"error_category\": \"PARSING_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 90,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Hyphenation required for compound adjective in UK English.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nEach error object **must** include only the four fields described above \u2014 `issue_id`, `error_category`, `confidence_score`, and `reasoning`. The runner will map `issue_id` back to the original detection row and attach the LLM fields to that issue.\n\nIMPORTANT: Always return a JSON array even for a single issue. For example, the array must be:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 0,\n    \"error_category\": \"PARSING_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 90,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Short single-sentence reason\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nDo not return the single object without wrapping it in an array. Also ensure every string uses double-quotes and there are no trailing commas.\n\n---",

This is much more user -friendly compared to raw machine code. For example, the LDA command loads data, while the ADD command performs addition. Low -level languages, like assembly, are commonly used for system programming tasks that require direct hardware access or fine control over memory management. These tasks include writing device drivers, operating systems, and embedded systems software.\n\nLow -level languages are also chosen for performance -critical applications, such as real -time systems, and are often employed in embedded systems where memory and performance requirements are strict.\n\n#### **Compilers**\n\nA compiler converts high -level languages into machine executable code in one go.\n\nCompilers check for errors in the code before turning it into machine code. If there are mistakes, it will point them out, and an error message will be outputted. Some compilers can improve the code to make it run faster or use less memory using optimisation.\n\nAdvantages of compilers:\n\n- programs compiled into machine code usually run faster than those not compiled, because the computer executes the machine code directly\n- compilers can catch mistakes in the code before you try to run it, saving you time and frustration\n- many compilers optimise the code, making the final program more\n\n\n```\n\n---\n### Page 80\n| issue_id | issue | highlighted_context |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 173 | edn | ...eyword is incorrectly spelt.

Example: Adding two numbers together instead of taking them away.\n- **Runtime:** An error that only occurs when the program is running and is difficult to foresee before a program is compiled and run. Example: Dividing a value by 0.\n- **Syntax:** An error that occurs when a command does not follow the expected syntax of the language, e.g. when a keyword is incorrectly spelt. Examples: 'edn if' instead of 'end if'\n- **Linking:** An error that occurs when a programmer calls a function within a program and the correct library has not been linked to that program. Example: When the square root function is used and the library that calculates the square root has not been linked to the program\n- **Rounding:** Rounding is when a number is approximated to nearest whole number/tenth/hundredth. Example: 34.5 rounded to nearest whole number is 35, an error of +0.5.\n- **Truncating:** Truncating is when a number is approximated to a whole number/tenth/hundredth. Example: 34.9 truncated to whole number is 34, an error of \u20130.9.\n\n\n```\n\n---\n### Page 84\n| issue_id | issue | highlighted_context |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 176 | menu driven | ...ace (GUI), Command Line Interface (CLI) **menu driven** and Mobile User Interface (MUI). - **Se... |\n| 177 | MUI | ... menu driven and Mobile User Interface (**MUI**). - **Security :** Many operating syste... |\n\nPage context:\n```markdown\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n- **Interface :** The OS provides the connection between the user and the system.

This is much more user -friendly compared to raw machine code. For example, the LDA command loads data, while the ADD command performs addition.

These tasks include writing device drivers, operating systems, and embedded systems software.\n\nLow -level languages are also chosen for performance -critical applications, such as real -time systems, and are often employed in embedded systems where memory and performance requirements are strict.\n\n#### **Compilers**\n\nA compiler converts high -level languages into machine executable code in one go.\n\nCompilers check for errors in the code before turning it into machine code. If there are mistakes, it will point them out, and an error message will be outputted. Some compilers can improve the code to make it run faster or use less memory using optimisation.\n\nAdvantages of compilers:\n\n- programs compiled into machine code usually run faster than those not compiled, because the computer executes the machine code directly\n- compilers can catch mistakes in the code before you try to run it, saving you time and frustration\n- many compilers optimise the code, making the final program more\n\n\n```\n\n---\n### Page 80\n| issue_id | issue | highlighted_context |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 173 | edn | ...eyword is incorrectly spelt.
