The document has already been scanned by automated tools.\n\n**Your Goal:** Act as a senior editor. You are looking for \"silent\" errors\u2014issues that pass a standard spell-check but fail a human reading. Focus on meaning, flow, consistency, and complex grammatical structures.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** All spelling and grammar checks must use British English conventions. Where there is doubt, consult the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) or Collins Dictionary as authoritative sources.\n\n---\n\n## Negative Constraints (What to IGNORE)\nThis document was converted from PDF via OCR. You will likely see conversion artifacts. **Do NOT report the following:**\n* **Hyphenation Issues:** (e.g., \"ta- ble\", \"effec- tive\"). Assume a separate script cleans these.\n* **Character Swaps:** (e.g., `1` instead of `l`, `0` instead of `O`) unless it creates a valid but wrong word (e.g., `10` instead of `to`).\n* **Known Issues:** Do not report any issue listed in the **Exclusion List** below.\n\n### Guiding Principles & Authoritative Sources\n\n* **Validator's Stance:** Your primary duty is to protect linguistic quality. The burden of proof is on the **tool's suggestion**. \n\n* **Authoritative Sources:** When in doubt, especially for `Spelling Error` or `False Positive` decisions, you must consult authoritative sources.\n    * **British English:** Oxford English Dictionary (OED), Collins Dictionary.\n    * **Welsh:** Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru (GPC), Termau Cyd.\n    * **French:** Dictionnaire de l'Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, Larousse.\n    * **German:** Duden.\n    * **Spanish:** Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola (RAE).\n\nReference these in your reasoning when applicable.\n## Detection Guidelines\nScan the text specifically for these high-level issues:\n\n### 1. Contextual Spelling & Homophones\n* **Atomic Typos:** Words that are spelled correctly but are wrong for the context (e.g., \"their\" vs \"there\", \"assess\" vs \"access\", \"trial\" vs \"trail\").\n* **Homophones:** e.g., \"pair\" vs \"pear\", \"board\" vs \"bored\".\n* **Proper Noun Accuracy:** Ensure terminology like \"Wi-Fi\" or \"PowerPoint\" is capitalized/spelled correctly if standard.\n\n### 2. Complex Grammar & Syntax\n* **Strict Subject-Verb Agreement:**\n    * **Distractor Nouns:** Ensure the verb agrees with the true subject, not the nearest noun (e.g., \"The list of items *are*...\" -> \"*is*\").\n    * **Compound Technical Subjects:** Flag instances where two distinct technical concepts joined by \"and\" take a singular verb. In formal specifications, \"A and B\" are plural, even if they achieve a single result.\n        * *Error:* \"Indentation and white space *improves* readability.\" (Implies they are one single concept).\n        * *Correction:* \"Indentation and white space *improve* readability.\" (Acknowledges two distinct tools).\n* **Dangling Modifiers:** Ensure the introductory phrase logically modifies the subject immediately following it.\n    * *Error:* \"Walking down the road, the building came into view.\" (The building was not walking).\n* **Ambiguity:** Flag sentences where pronouns (\"it\", \"this\", \"they\") could refer to multiple preceding nouns, forcing the reader to guess.\n\n### 3. Consistency (The \"Editor's Eye\")\n* **Variations:** If the text uses \"co-ordinate\" on page 1 and \"coordinate\" on page 5, flag the inconsistency.\n* **Formatting:** Inconsistent capitalization in headers or bullet points.\n\n### Error Categories\n\n### Error Categories\n\n- `SPELLING_ERROR`: The token is not a valid word in the dictionary for the target dialect. For English, always use British English spelling and conventions.\n    - **Examples:** `Malcom X` (should be Malcolm), `warravaged` (missing hyphen), `definately`.\n- `ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR`: An objective breach of syntax rules - wrong in all contexts.\n    - **Examples:** Missing prepositions (`collective highly qualified authors`), extra words (`quantity and of goods`), or capitalisation errors (`therefore, That...`).\n- `CONSISTENCY_ERROR`: The usage is valid in isolation but contradicts patterns established elsewhere.\n    - **Examples:** Mixing `war communism` and `war Communism`, or spelling it `Malcom X` in a question when the source text says `Malcolm X`.\n- `AMBIGUOUS_PHRASING`: The text is grammatically valid but the syntax creates confusion (e.g., dangling modifiers).\n    - **Examples:** `Faced with the potential of radical elements, the demands were met...` (Implies the 'demands' were facing the elements, not the government).\n- `FACTUAL_INACCURACY`: Objectively false statement or terminology.\n    - **Examples:** Referring to Lenin's `April Theses` as the `April Thesis`.\n\nAlways return the enum values exactly as written above (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE).\n\n#### Rules for Commas before Conjunctions (and, but, or)\n\nClassify comma issues between independent clauses using the following hierarchy:\n\n1.  **`ABSOLUTE_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR`**: Use this if the text contains a **comma splice** (two independent clauses joined only by a comma without a conjunction) or a **run-on sentence** (two independent clauses joined with no punctuation).\n2.  **`AMBIGUOUS_PHRASING`**: Use this if the absence (or presence) of the comma causes the subject of the second clause to be misidentified.\n3.  **`STYLISTIC_PREFERENCE`**: Use this for all other optional comma suggestions intended to change the pacing or \"flow\" of the sentence.\n## Output Format\n\nAll spelling and grammar rules must be based on British English.\n\nReturn a **single top-level JSON array** (no surrounding object, no page keys) and nothing else. Do not include backticks, commentary, or any text before or after the JSON. Each array element represents one issue from the table.\n\nFor each issue, output a full object following the format below:\n\n- `issue_id`: integer \u2014 the issue identifier from the input CSV (auto-increment per-document)\n- `issue`: The specific word or short phrase containing the error.\n- `page_number`: The page number where the issue is located from your context.\n- `highlighted_context`: The sentence containing the error (plus the preceding and succeeding sentence, if necessary for clarity) with the error highlighted using double asterisks `**` before and after the error.\n- `error_category`: one of the enum values listed in \"Error Categories\" above (e.g., `SPELLING_ERROR`)\n- `confidence_score`: integer 0\u2013100 (if you prefer to provide 0\u20131 floats, the runner will convert them)\n- `reasoning`: single-sentence justification\n\n### Example Output\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 0,\n    \"issue\": \"loose\",\n    \"highlighted_context\": \"The students **loose** several marks for poor grammar.\",\n    \"error_category\": \"SPELLING_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 95,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Common misspelling of 'lose' in this context.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 1,\n    \"issue\": \"well-run\",\n    \"highlighted_context\": \"This was a **well-run** event that concluded smoothly.\",\n    \"error_category\": \"POSSIBLE_AMBIGUOUS_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 88,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Compound adjective requires hyphenation in UK English when used before a noun.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n\nEach error object **must** include only the fields described above.\n\nIMPORTANT: Always return a JSON array even for a single issue.\n\nDo not return the single object without wrapping it in an array.

During this stage code is written, version control, unit testing and finally integration of modules into one unified system.\n- **Testing:** This is crucial for the reliability and quality of the software. This stage focusses on fixing bugs and testing the validation of the software, ensuring that it works as intended. There will be a range of testing strategies including functional, integration, unit and acceptance testing.\n- **Deployment:** This is the process of taking it from the development stage and making it available to the end user. This stage is crucial and requires careful management to ensure a smooth transition.\n- **Maintenance, support and refinement:** Once the system is live and has been fully deployed the maintenance support and refinement stage starts. This is an ongoing support that involves bug fixes, updates, performance optimisation, security updates and support.\n\nLearners should be aware of the legal, ethical and social consideration surrounding software development.\n\n#### **Legal Considerations:**\n\n- **Intellectual Property (IP):** Developers must ensure they respect IP laws, including copyright, patents, and trademarks.\n- **Data Protection and Privacy Laws:** Software handling personal or sensitive data must comply with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA).\n- **Licensing Agreements:** Software developers must adhere to the terms of software licenses, whether creating open -source, proprietary, or commercial software. Misuse of licensed content can result in legal consequences.\n- **Liability and Accountability:** Developers must consider legal accountability for defects, bugs, or security vulnerabilities in their software that could lead to damage or harm.\n\n\n```\n\n---\n### Page 80\n| issue_id | issue | highlighted_context |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 160 | nearest | ...ing is when a number is approximated to **nearest** whole number/tenth/hundredth.

Example: Adding two numbers together instead of taking them away.\n- **Runtime:** An error that only occurs when the program is running and is difficult to foresee before a program is compiled and run. Example: Dividing a value by 0.\n- **Syntax:** An error that occurs when a command does not follow the expected syntax of the language, e.g. when a keyword is incorrectly spelt. Examples: 'edn if' instead of 'end if'\n- **Linking:** An error that occurs when a programmer calls a function within a program and the correct library has not been linked to that program. Example: When the square root function is used and the library that calculates the square root has not been linked to the program\n- **Rounding:** Rounding is when a number is approximated to nearest whole number/tenth/hundredth. Example: 34.5 rounded to nearest whole number is 35, an error of +0.5.\n- **Truncating:** Truncating is when a number is approximated to a whole number/tenth/hundredth. Example: 34.9 truncated to whole number is 34, an error of \u20130.9.\n\n\n```\n\n---\n### Page 137\n| issue_id | issue | highlighted_context |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 196 | Phyisical | ...porting to be a legitimate company. \\| \\| **Phyisical** data breach \\| A type of data breach; oc... |\n| 197 | PIcture | .... \\| \\| Pixel \\| The word used to describe **PIcture** ELements, these are the smallest elemen... |\n| 198 | ELements | ...xel \\| The word used to describe PIcture **ELements**, these are the smallest elements that c... |\n\nPage context:\n```markdown\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Parity Check | A type of verification check which is used during the transmission of data.

This is an ongoing support that involves bug fixes, updates, performance optimisation, security updates and support.\n\nLearners should be aware of the legal, ethical and social consideration surrounding software development.\n\n#### **Legal Considerations:**\n\n- **Intellectual Property (IP):** Developers must ensure they respect IP laws, including copyright, patents, and trademarks.\n- **Data Protection and Privacy Laws:** Software handling personal or sensitive data must comply with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA).\n- **Licensing Agreements:** Software developers must adhere to the terms of software licenses, whether creating open -source, proprietary, or commercial software. Misuse of licensed content can result in legal consequences.\n- **Liability and Accountability:** Developers must consider legal accountability for defects, bugs, or security vulnerabilities in their software that could lead to damage or harm.\n\n\n```\n\n---\n### Page 80\n| issue_id | issue | highlighted_context |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 160 | nearest | ...ing is when a number is approximated to **nearest** whole number/tenth/hundredth.

Example: Adding two numbers together instead of taking them away.\n- **Runtime:** An error that only occurs when the program is running and is difficult to foresee before a program is compiled and run. Example: Dividing a value by 0.\n- **Syntax:** An error that occurs when a command does not follow the expected syntax of the language, e.g. when a keyword is incorrectly spelt. Examples: 'edn if' instead of 'end if'\n- **Linking:** An error that occurs when a programmer calls a function within a program and the correct library has not been linked to that program. Example: When the square root function is used and the library that calculates the square root has not been linked to the program\n- **Rounding:** Rounding is when a number is approximated to nearest whole number/tenth/hundredth. Example: 34.5 rounded to nearest whole number is 35, an error of +0.5.\n- **Truncating:** Truncating is when a number is approximated to a whole number/tenth/hundredth. Example: 34.9 truncated to whole number is 34, an error of \u20130.9.\n\n\n```\n\n---\n### Page 137\n| issue_id | issue | highlighted_context |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 196 | Phyisical | ...porting to be a legitimate company. \\| \\| **Phyisical** data breach \\| A type of data breach; oc... |\n| 197 | PIcture | .... \\| \\| Pixel \\| The word used to describe **PIcture** ELements, these are the smallest elemen... |\n| 198 | ELements | ...xel \\| The word used to describe PIcture **ELements**, these are the smallest elements that c... |\n\nPage context:\n```markdown\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Parity Check | A type of verification check which is used during the transmission of data.
