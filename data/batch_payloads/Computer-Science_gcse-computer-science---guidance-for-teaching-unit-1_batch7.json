    "You are an expert proofreader and copy-editor, specialising in the final-pass review of documents for the Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC). You have an exceptional eye for detail, understanding that ever the smallest error can undermine the credibility of the entire document.\nYou possess specialist knowledge of Welsh educational terminology, WJEC-specific stylistic idioms, and common documentation formats.\nYour analysis must be uncompromisingly rigorous to catch all errors. Failure to do so will result in severe reputational damage to the WJEC. It will also disappoint the students and teachers who rely on the WJEC to provide accurate and reliable educational materials.\n<!--\n  Template context contract (provided by prompt_factory.py):\n    subject         -> string (e.g., \"Art-and-Design\")\n    filename        -> string (e.g., \"gcse-art-and-design---guidance-for-teaching.md\")\n    issue_table     -> Markdown string representing the batch table\n    page_context    -> iterable of { page_number: int, content: str }\n    retry_context?  -> optional note when re-asking the model (not currently used)\n-->\n\n## Document Under Review\n\nYou are reviewing **Computer-Science / gcse-computer-science---guidance-for-teaching-unit-1.md** from the WJEC Made-for-Wales 2025 GCSE documentation set. Treat this as a high-stakes proofread: every issue in the table below must be checked against the provided page excerpts.\n\n## Inputs\n\n1. **Issue Batch (Table):** Each row mirrors the original LanguageTool output for the current batch of issues.\n2. **Page Context:** The raw Markdown for each page referenced by this batch. Use it to confirm what the learner-facing document actually says.\n\n---\n\n## Task\n\nYour role is to act as a specialist linguistic validator, reassessing every row in the issue table. Do **not** rely on the LanguageTool `Type` or message alone\u2014use the page context, your WJEC domain knowledge, and authoritative sources to decide whether the suggestion is correct, optional, or a false alarm.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n### Guiding Principles & Authoritative Sources\n\n* **Validator's Stance:** Your primary duty is to protect linguistic quality. The burden of proof is on the **tool's suggestion**. Assume the original `[DOCUMENT TO REVIEW]` is correct unless the tool's suggestion definitively corrects an unambiguous error.\n* **Authoritative Sources:** When in doubt, especially for `Spelling Error` or `False Positive` decisions, you must consult authoritative sources.\n    * **UK English:** Oxford English Dictionary (OED), Collins Dictionary.\n    * **Welsh:** Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru (GPC), Termau Cyd.\n    * **French:** Dictionnaire de l'Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, Larousse.\n    * **German:** Duden.\n    * **Spanish:** Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola (RAE).\n    * **Specialist Terms:** Refer to the `[DOCUMENT TO REVIEW]` for context.\n## Decision-Making Workflow\n\nFor **each issue** in the table:\n\n1. **Locate & Understand:** Use `context_from_tool` and the page excerpt to confirm the exact wording.\n2. **Evaluate:** Judge the reported problem against authoritative sources and WJEC conventions.\n3. **Categorise:** Choose one category from the list below (machine-readable enum values).\n4. **Score:** Provide a confidence score between 0\u2013100 (integers only).\n5. **Justify:** Supply a single concise sentence explaining the decision.\n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn a **single top-level JSON array** (no surrounding object, no page keys) and nothing else. Do not include backticks, commentary, or any text before or after the JSON. Each array element represents one issue from the table.\n\nIMPORTANT: the categoriser only needs to provide the LLM results for each issue \u2014 the detection fields are already known from the input CSV and are re-applied server-side. For each issue, return exactly the following fields and nothing more:\n\n- `issue_id`: integer \u2014 the issue identifier from the input CSV (auto-increment per-document)\n- `error_category`: one of the enum values listed in \"Error Categories\" above (e.g., `PARSING_ERROR`)\n- `confidence_score`: integer 0\u2013100 (if you prefer to provide 0\u20131 floats, the runner will convert them)\n- `reasoning`: single-sentence justification\n\nExample minimal output:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 0,\n    \"error_category\": \"POSSIBLE_AMBIGUOUS_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 70,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Comma improves clarity but omission is not a factual error.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 1,\n    \"error_category\": \"PARSING_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 90,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Hyphenation required for compound adjective in UK English.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nEach error object **must** include only the four fields described above \u2014 `issue_id`, `error_category`, `confidence_score`, and `reasoning`. The runner will map `issue_id` back to the original detection row and attach the LLM fields to that issue.\n\nIMPORTANT: Always return a JSON array even for a single issue. For example, the array must be:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 0,\n    \"error_category\": \"PARSING_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 90,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Short single-sentence reason\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nDo not return the single object without wrapping it in an array. Also ensure every string uses double-quotes and there are no trailing commas.\n\n---",

They form the foundation of modern broadband, enabling high -speed services like FTTH (Fibre to the Home).\n- 4G/5G Mobile Networks: Wireless networks have advanced, with 4G and now 5 G enabling high -speed internet on mobile devices. 5G offers ultra -low latency, higher speeds, and supports a vast number of connected devices (IoT).\n\n#### \u2022 **Wi -Fi :**\n\n\u2022 Wi -Fi Evolution: Wireless local area networks (WLANs) have evolved from early Wi -Fi 802.11 standards with limited range and speed to the modern Wi -Fi 6, which provides faster speeds, reduces network congestion, and enhances connectivity in crowded areas.\n\n#### \u2022 **Emerging Trends** :\n\n- Low Earth Orbit Satellites: Initiatives like Starlink and OneWeb aim to deliver high -speed broadband via satellites : by orbiting the earth at lower heights makes for higher speeds and lower latency.\n- 6G and Beyond: Research into 6G networks is progressing, promising even faster speeds, lower latency, and the potential to support cutting -edge technologies.\n\n\n```\n\n### Page 50\n```markdown\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 1.3.2 Cybersecurity and personal privacy\n\nLearners should know the characteristics and definitions of threats to computer systems, including:\n\n- malware such as viruses, trojan horses, ransomware, worms and spyware\n- social engineering such as phishing, pretexting, baiting, quid pro quo and impersonation\n- brute force attacks such as simple brute force, dictionary attacks, hybrid brute force, reverse brute force and credential stuffing\n- denial of service attacks such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), volume-based attacks, protocol attacks and application-layer attacks\n- data interception and theft such as man-in-themiddle (MiTM) attacks, packet sniffing, keylogging, session hijacking and IP spoofing\n- SQL injection such as error-based, unionbased, blind Boolean-based and blind timebased.\n\nLearners should be aware of the legal and ethical aspects of network security, including privacy concerns related to data transmission over networks.\n\nLearners should know the purpose of different methods of protecting against threats during system design, creation, testing and use, including:\n\n- penetration testing\n- network forensics\n- anti-malware software\n\nOnline networks are vital for business communication and data management but are vulnerable to attacks aimed at accessing sensitive data.\n\nEnsuring data is secure and free from loss or corruption is essential for business reputation and legal implications. Cybersecurity are the methods and measures a business will use to safeguard computer systems, networks and data from unauthorised access or cyberattacks.\n\nCyberattacks typically involve different forms of malware, also known as malicious software. There are various types:\n\n#### **Malware:**\n\n- **Viruses**: A computer program that can copy itself onto other programs often with the intention of maliciously damaging data. Transmitted by 'piggybacking' on another program known as a 'vector'.\n- **Trojan horse:** this malware that pretends to be harmless but contains harmful code. It tricks users into activating it, allowing unauthorised activities. Once installed it can create range of issues, from stealing data, providing a backdoor to cyber criminals who wish to gain remote access or the monitoring of activity on a system. This type of malware can sit undetected without appropriate protection and monitoring.\n- **Ransomware:** software that will restrict the access of data or systems to the user unless a ransom is paid. This is often done through encryption, blocking, or locking the data.\n- **Worms:** malware, like a virus, but is a standalone program that replicates itself to spread to other computers. It does not need a vector. This will find vulnerabilities in the system and then replicate itself to attack these vulnerabilities. They will then corrupt, delete or install back door access.\n- **Spyware:** Malware that secretly monitors a user's activities, collecting information without user consent or knowledge. Usually installed by opening attachments or downloading infected software. It can track browsing habits, messages and keystrokes using Keyloggers.\n\n\n```\n\n\n---"
