    "You are an expert proofreader and copy-editor, specialising in the final-pass review of documents for the Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC). You have an exceptional eye for detail, understanding that ever the smallest error can undermine the credibility of the entire document.\nYou possess specialist knowledge of Welsh educational terminology, WJEC-specific stylistic idioms, and common documentation formats.\nYour analysis must be uncompromisingly rigorous to catch all errors. Failure to do so will result in severe reputational damage to the WJEC. It will also disappoint the students and teachers who rely on the WJEC to provide accurate and reliable educational materials.\n<!--\n  Template context contract (provided by prompt_factory.py):\n    subject         -> string (e.g., \"Art-and-Design\")\n    filename        -> string (e.g., \"gcse-art-and-design---guidance-for-teaching.md\")\n    issue_table     -> Markdown string representing the batch table\n    page_context    -> iterable of { page_number: int, content: str }\n    retry_context?  -> optional note when re-asking the model (not currently used)\n-->\n\n## Document Under Review\n\nYou are reviewing **Computer-Science / gcse-computer-science---guidance-for-teaching-unit-1.md** from the WJEC Made-for-Wales 2025 GCSE documentation set. Treat this as a high-stakes proofread: every issue in the table below must be checked against the provided page excerpts.\n\n## Inputs\n\n1. **Issue Batch (Table):** Each row mirrors the original LanguageTool output for the current batch of issues.\n2. **Page Context:** The raw Markdown for each page referenced by this batch. Use it to confirm what the learner-facing document actually says.\n\n---\n\n## Task\n\nYour role is to act as a specialist linguistic validator, reassessing every row in the issue table. Do **not** rely on the LanguageTool `Type` or message alone\u2014use the page context, your WJEC domain knowledge, and authoritative sources to decide whether the suggestion is correct, optional, or a false alarm.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n### Guiding Principles & Authoritative Sources\n\n* **Validator's Stance:** Your primary duty is to protect linguistic quality. The burden of proof is on the **tool's suggestion**. Assume the original `[DOCUMENT TO REVIEW]` is correct unless the tool's suggestion definitively corrects an unambiguous error.\n* **Authoritative Sources:** When in doubt, especially for `Spelling Error` or `False Positive` decisions, you must consult authoritative sources.\n    * **UK English:** Oxford English Dictionary (OED), Collins Dictionary.\n    * **Welsh:** Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru (GPC), Termau Cyd.\n    * **French:** Dictionnaire de l'Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, Larousse.\n    * **German:** Duden.\n    * **Spanish:** Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola (RAE).\n    * **Specialist Terms:** Refer to the `[DOCUMENT TO REVIEW]` for context.\n## Decision-Making Workflow\n\nFor **each issue** in the table:\n\n1. **Locate & Understand:** Use `context_from_tool` and the page excerpt to confirm the exact wording.\n2. **Evaluate:** Judge the reported problem against authoritative sources and WJEC conventions.\n3. **Categorise:** Choose one category from the list below (machine-readable enum values).\n4. **Score:** Provide a confidence score between 0\u2013100 (integers only).\n5. **Justify:** Supply a single concise sentence explaining the decision.\n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn a **single top-level JSON array** (no surrounding object, no page keys) and nothing else. Do not include backticks, commentary, or any text before or after the JSON. Each array element represents one issue from the table.\n\nIMPORTANT: the categoriser only needs to provide the LLM results for each issue \u2014 the detection fields are already known from the input CSV and are re-applied server-side. For each issue, return exactly the following fields and nothing more:\n\n- `issue_id`: integer \u2014 the issue identifier from the input CSV (auto-increment per-document)\n- `error_category`: one of the enum values listed in \"Error Categories\" above (e.g., `PARSING_ERROR`)\n- `confidence_score`: integer 0\u2013100 (if you prefer to provide 0\u20131 floats, the runner will convert them)\n- `reasoning`: single-sentence justification\n\nExample minimal output:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 0,\n    \"error_category\": \"POSSIBLE_AMBIGUOUS_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 70,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Comma improves clarity but omission is not a factual error.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 1,\n    \"error_category\": \"PARSING_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 90,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Hyphenation required for compound adjective in UK English.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nEach error object **must** include only the four fields described above \u2014 `issue_id`, `error_category`, `confidence_score`, and `reasoning`. The runner will map `issue_id` back to the original detection row and attach the LLM fields to that issue.\n\nIMPORTANT: Always return a JSON array even for a single issue. For example, the array must be:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 0,\n    \"error_category\": \"PARSING_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 90,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Short single-sentence reason\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nDo not return the single object without wrapping it in an array. Also ensure every string uses double-quotes and there are no trailing commas.\n\n---",

They provide extra capabilities for the computer systems. Examples include:\n  - **Graphic cards** responsible for rendering images, videos and animations on the monitor. These are essential for gaming, video editing and graphic intensive tasks.\n  - **Sound cards** manage the input and output of audio signals. They improve sound quality, receive audio signals from microphones and musical instruments and provide audio for speakers.\n- **Network Interface Card (NIC) -** allows a computer to connect to a network, such as internet or local area network (LAN):\n  - **Wired NICs** use cable, such as ethernet, to connect a computer to a network\n  - **Wireless NICs** uses Wi-Fi technology to connect to a network without the need for wires.\n- **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) -** responsible for rendering images, videos and animations. It processes graphical data and is essential for tasks like gaming, video editing and 3D rendering. There are two types of GPUs:\n  - **Integrated** is built into the processor chip and shares the memory with the CPU. It uses less power than dedicated GPUs.\n  - **Dedicated** has its own memory, known as VRAM, and doesn't share it with the CPU. It consumes more power and has higher performance when compared to integrated GPUs.\n- **Cooling Systems -** provide a way of regulating the temperature of key components, such as the CPU and GPU. This prevents overheating and therefore damage to the components. There are two main types:\n  - **Liquid Cooling** uses liquid to transfer heat away from the components.\n\n\n```\n\n---\n### Page 11\n| issue_id | issue | highlighted_context |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 4 | PDIF | ...s, microphones, and speakers.     - **S/**PDIF** / TOSLINK:** For digital audio transmis... |\n\nPage context:\n```markdown\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\n- **Air Cooling** - uses fans and/or heat sinks to dissipate the heat.\n- **Connectivity ports** allow the computer to interact with external devices and peripherals.\n  - **Universal Serial Bus (USB)** - used to connect external devices like, keyboards, mice, headsets and storage devices.

It ser ves as bridge between level 1 and level 3 or main memory (RAM) . It can either be located inside the CPU or outside, depending on the architecture of the motherboard.\n- **Level 3:** Found outside the CPU. It is shared among cores, this cache is larger and slower than L1 and L2 caches, but faster than RAM. It helps improve performance when multiple cores are trying to access the same data.\n- The **fetch -decode -execute cycle** is the basic process the CPU uses to execute instructions. It involves fetching the instruction from memory, decoding it, and then executing it. Each part of the cycle is managed by a different component of the CPU. The main operations which occur during each phase of the Fetch -Decode - Execute cycle are:\n  - Fetch phase:\n    - Load the **MAR** with the address of the next instruction to be executed.\n    - Check if the instruction is in the **cache memory**. If it is, fetch it directly from the cache.\n    - If the instruction is not in the cache, fetch it from main memory into the **MDR**, then transfer it to the **CIR**. Store the fetched instruction in the **cache** .\n- Increment the **PC** to point to the address of the next instruction.\n  - Decode phase:\n    - The **CU** translates the instruction in the **CIR**.\n    - The **CU** determines the required operations and selects the necessary machine resources. Check the **cache** for any required data. If the data is not in the **cache**, fetch it from main memory into the **MDR** .\n  - Execute phase:\n\n\n```\n\n---\n### Page 15\n| issue_id | issue | highlighted_context |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 6 | Hexa | ... cores - Quad -core will have 4 cores - **Hexa** -core will have 6 cores - Deca -core wi... |\n| 7 | Deca | ... cores - Hexa -core will have 6 cores - **Deca** -core will have 10 cores - it is also p... |\n\nPage context:\n```markdown\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n- The instruction is executed, which may involve mathematical or logical operations in the **ALU**, memory access, or I/O operations.\n- Use the **ACC** to store intermediate results. The **MDR** may be used to transfer data between the **CPU** and memory.\n\n#### Factors that affect CPU performance\n\n- : \u2022 Clock speed : is the frequency with which the CPU can execute instructions , one clock tick per second would be measured as 1 Hz . The clock speed is commonly measured in gigahertz (GHz) which means that if there is a clock speed of 3 GHz it can execute 3 billion instructions per second.\n- Number of cores: A core is an independent processing unit within a CPU. Modern CPUs can have multiple cores, allowing them to perform multiple tasks **simultaneously:**\n- Dual -core will have 2 cores\n- Quad -core will have 4 cores\n- Hexa -core will have 6 cores\n- Deca -core will have 10 cores\n- it is also possible to get 12, 16, 24 and 64 cores within a CPU\n- Cache size: Larger cache sizes reduce the average memory access time; more frequently accessed data is stored closer to the CPU cores. This allows for faster execution of instructions since the CPU spends less time waiting for data to be fetched from slower main memory.\n- Parallel processing : More cores enable better multitasking and can significantly improve performance in applications designed for parallel processing.\n- Threading : is how the processor handles and executes multiple sequences of instructions (called **threads**) simultaneously. Each thread represents a single sequence of operations that the CPU can execute independently.\n- Single threading can only execute one thread at a time.\n\n\n```\n\n---\n### Page 16\n| issue_id | issue | highlighted_context |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 8 | multi tasking | ...t a time, which improves performance in **multi tasking** and parallel processing.  #### **RAM** ... |\n\nPage context:\n```markdown\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n\u2022 Multilevel threading allows a single CPU core to manage more than one thread at a time, which improves performance in multi tasking and parallel processing.\n\n#### **RAM**\n\n- **Temporary Storage**: RAM holds data that the computer's processor needs right now or in the near future. When you turn off your computer, all data in RAM is lost.\n- **Speed**: RAM is much faster than other types of storage like hard drives or SSDs. This speed helps your computer run smoothly and quickly.\n- **Volatile Memory**: This means that RAM needs power to keep the data. Once the power is off, the data is gone.\n- **Capacity**: The amount of RAM in a computer can affect its performance. More RAM allows a computer to handle more tasks at once without slowing down. RAM can range from gigabytes to terabytes.\n- **Types** of RAM:\n- **DRAM (Dynamic RAM)**: This is the most common type of RAM used in computers.\n- **SRAM (Static RAM)**: Faster and more expensive than DRAM, used in smaller amounts for cache memory.\n\n#### **Buses**\n\n- **Data Bus:** Carries the actual data being processed. For example, when you open a file, the data bus transfers the file's data from the hard drive to the RAM.\n- **Address Bus:** Carries information about where the data should go. It tells the computer where to find or store data in memory.\n- **Control Bus:** Carries control signals that manage the operations of the computer. These signals ensure that all parts of the computer work together smoothly.\n\n\n```\n\n---\n### Page 19\n| issue_id | issue | highlighted_context |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 9 | Game Game | ...li&gt;Allows users to control video games. **Game Game** Controller: controllers can have a rang... |\n\nPage context:\n```markdown\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  | <ul><li>3D Chip Architecture: 3D chip architecture stacks layers of chips vertically, allowing more components in less space.

It ser ves as bridge between level 1 and level 3 or main memory (RAM) . It can either be located inside the CPU or outside, depending on the architecture of the motherboard.\n- **Level 3:** Found outside the CPU. It is shared among cores, this cache is larger and slower than L1 and L2 caches, but faster than RAM. It helps improve performance when multiple cores are trying to access the same data.\n- The **fetch -decode -execute cycle** is the basic process the CPU uses to execute instructions. It involves fetching the instruction from memory, decoding it, and then executing it. Each part of the cycle is managed by a different component of the CPU. The main operations which occur during each phase of the Fetch -Decode - Execute cycle are:\n  - Fetch phase:\n    - Load the **MAR** with the address of the next instruction to be executed.\n    - Check if the instruction is in the **cache memory**. If it is, fetch it directly from the cache.\n    - If the instruction is not in the cache, fetch it from main memory into the **MDR**, then transfer it to the **CIR**. Store the fetched instruction in the **cache** .\n- Increment the **PC** to point to the address of the next instruction.\n  - Decode phase:\n    - The **CU** translates the instruction in the **CIR**.\n    - The **CU** determines the required operations and selects the necessary machine resources. Check the **cache** for any required data. If the data is not in the **cache**, fetch it from main memory into the **MDR** .\n  - Execute phase:\n\n\n```\n\n### Page 15\n```markdown\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n- The instruction is executed, which may involve mathematical or logical operations in the **ALU**, memory access, or I/O operations.\n- Use the **ACC** to store intermediate results. The **MDR** may be used to transfer data between the **CPU** and memory.\n\n#### Factors that affect CPU performance\n\n- : \u2022 Clock speed : is the frequency with which the CPU can execute instructions , one clock tick per second would be measured as 1 Hz . The clock speed is commonly measured in gigahertz (GHz) which means that if there is a clock speed of 3 GHz it can execute 3 billion instructions per second.\n- Number of cores: A core is an independent processing unit within a CPU. Modern CPUs can have multiple cores, allowing them to perform multiple tasks **simultaneously:**\n- Dual -core will have 2 cores\n- Quad -core will have 4 cores\n- Hexa -core will have 6 cores\n- Deca -core will have 10 cores\n- it is also possible to get 12, 16, 24 and 64 cores within a CPU\n- Cache size: Larger cache sizes reduce the average memory access time; more frequently accessed data is stored closer to the CPU cores. This allows for faster execution of instructions since the CPU spends less time waiting for data to be fetched from slower main memory.\n- Parallel processing : More cores enable better multitasking and can significantly improve performance in applications designed for parallel processing.\n- Threading : is how the processor handles and executes multiple sequences of instructions (called **threads**) simultaneously. Each thread represents a single sequence of operations that the CPU can execute independently.\n- Single threading can only execute one thread at a time.\n\n\n```\n\n### Page 16\n```markdown\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n\u2022 Multilevel threading allows a single CPU core to manage more than one thread at a time, which improves performance in multi tasking and parallel processing.\n\n#### **RAM**\n\n- **Temporary Storage**: RAM holds data that the computer's processor needs right now or in the near future. When you turn off your computer, all data in RAM is lost.\n- **Speed**: RAM is much faster than other types of storage like hard drives or SSDs. This speed helps your computer run smoothly and quickly.\n- **Volatile Memory**: This means that RAM needs power to keep the data. Once the power is off, the data is gone.\n- **Capacity**: The amount of RAM in a computer can affect its performance. More RAM allows a computer to handle more tasks at once without slowing down. RAM can range from gigabytes to terabytes.\n- **Types** of RAM:\n- **DRAM (Dynamic RAM)**: This is the most common type of RAM used in computers.\n- **SRAM (Static RAM)**: Faster and more expensive than DRAM, used in smaller amounts for cache memory.\n\n#### **Buses**\n\n- **Data Bus:** Carries the actual data being processed. For example, when you open a file, the data bus transfers the file's data from the hard drive to the RAM.\n- **Address Bus:** Carries information about where the data should go. It tells the computer where to find or store data in memory.\n- **Control Bus:** Carries control signals that manage the operations of the computer. These signals ensure that all parts of the computer work together smoothly.\n\n\n```\n\n### Page 19\n```markdown\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  | <ul><li>3D Chip Architecture: 3D chip architecture stacks layers of chips vertically, allowing more components in less space.

  "system": "You are an expert proofreader and copy-editor, specialising in the final-pass review of documents for the Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC). You have an exceptional eye for detail, understanding that ever the smallest error can undermine the credibility of the entire document.\nYou possess specialist knowledge of Welsh educational terminology, WJEC-specific stylistic idioms, and common documentation formats.\nYour analysis must be uncompromisingly rigorous to catch all errors. Failure to do so will result in severe reputational damage to the WJEC. It will also disappoint the students and teachers who rely on the WJEC to provide accurate and reliable educational materials.\n<!--\n  Template context contract (provided by prompt_factory.py):\n    subject         -> string (e.g., \"Art-and-Design\")\n    filename        -> string (e.g., \"gcse-art-and-design---guidance-for-teaching.md\")\n    issue_table     -> Markdown string representing the batch table\n    page_context    -> iterable of { page_number: int, content: str }\n    retry_context?  -> optional note when re-asking the model (not currently used)\n-->\n\n## Document Under Review\n\nYou are reviewing **Computer-Science / gcse-computer-science---guidance-for-teaching-unit-1.md** from the WJEC Made-for-Wales 2025 GCSE documentation set. Treat this as a high-stakes proofread: every issue in the table below must be checked against the provided page excerpts.\n\n## Inputs\n\n1. **Issue Batch (Table):** Each row mirrors the original LanguageTool output for the current batch of issues.\n2. **Page Context:** The raw Markdown for each page referenced by this batch. Use it to confirm what the learner-facing document actually says.\n\n---\n\n## Task\n\nYour role is to act as a specialist linguistic validator, reassessing every row in the issue table. Do **not** rely on the LanguageTool `Type` or message alone\u2014use the page context, your WJEC domain knowledge, and authoritative sources to decide whether the suggestion is correct, optional, or a false alarm.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n### Guiding Principles & Authoritative Sources\n\n* **Validator's Stance:** Your primary duty is to protect linguistic quality. The burden of proof is on the **tool's suggestion**. Assume the original `[DOCUMENT TO REVIEW]` is correct unless the tool's suggestion definitively corrects an unambiguous error.\n* **Authoritative Sources:** When in doubt, especially for `Spelling Error` or `False Positive` decisions, you must consult authoritative sources.\n    * **UK English:** Oxford English Dictionary (OED), Collins Dictionary.\n    * **Welsh:** Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru (GPC), Termau Cyd.\n    * **French:** Dictionnaire de l'Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, Larousse.\n    * **German:** Duden.\n    * **Spanish:** Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola (RAE).\n    * **Specialist Terms:** Refer to the `[DOCUMENT TO REVIEW]` for context.\n## Decision-Making Workflow\n\nFor **each issue** in the table:\n\n1. **Locate & Understand:** Use `context_from_tool` and the page excerpt to confirm the exact wording.\n2. **Evaluate:** Judge the reported problem against authoritative sources and WJEC conventions.\n3. **Categorise:** Choose one category from the list below (machine-readable enum values).\n4. **Score:** Provide a confidence score between 0\u2013100 (integers only).\n5. **Justify:** Supply a single concise sentence explaining the decision.\n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn a **single top-level JSON array** (no surrounding object, no page keys) and nothing else. Do not include backticks, commentary, or any text before or after the JSON. Each array element represents one issue from the table.\n\nIMPORTANT: the categoriser only needs to provide the LLM results for each issue \u2014 the detection fields are already known from the input CSV and are re-applied server-side. For each issue, return exactly the following fields and nothing more:\n\n- `issue_id`: integer \u2014 the issue identifier from the input CSV (auto-increment per-document)\n- `error_category`: one of the enum values listed in \"Error Categories\" above (e.g., `PARSING_ERROR`)\n- `confidence_score`: integer 0\u2013100 (if you prefer to provide 0\u20131 floats, the runner will convert them)\n- `reasoning`: single-sentence justification\n\nExample minimal output:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 0,\n    \"error_category\": \"POSSIBLE_AMBIGUOUS_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 70,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Comma improves clarity but omission is not a factual error.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 1,\n    \"error_category\": \"PARSING_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 90,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Hyphenation required for compound adjective in UK English.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nEach error object **must** include only the four fields described above \u2014 `issue_id`, `error_category`, `confidence_score`, and `reasoning`. The runner will map `issue_id` back to the original detection row and attach the LLM fields to that issue.\n\nIMPORTANT: Always return a JSON array even for a single issue. For example, the array must be:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 0,\n    \"error_category\": \"PARSING_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 90,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Short single-sentence reason\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nDo not return the single object without wrapping it in an array. Also ensure every string uses double-quotes and there are no trailing commas.\n\n---",

It consumes more power and has higher performance when compared to integrated GPUs.\n- **Cooling Systems -** provide a way of regulating the temperature of key components, such as the CPU and GPU. This prevents overheating and therefore damage to the components. There are two main types:\n  - **Liquid Cooling** uses liquid to transfer heat away from the components.\n\n\n```\n\n### Page 11\n```markdown\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\n- **Air Cooling** - uses fans and/or heat sinks to dissipate the heat.\n- **Connectivity ports** allow the computer to interact with external devices and peripherals.\n  - **Universal Serial Bus (USB)** - used to connect external devices like, keyboards, mice, headsets and storage devices. USB ports are versatile and support data transfer and power supply. USB connectors are assigned letter s to indicate their type, Type -A, Type -B, Type -C. USB ports also have numbers included to specify the USB generation. Currently , there are 4: USB 1.x, USB 2.0, USB 3.x, and USB 4. Each generation allows for faster transmission speeds and power delivery.\n  - **Display ports** - connect monitors or display devices to the system, providing high -definition video outputs. The main display ports are VGA , DVI, HDMI and DisplayPort .\n    - VGA: Older analogue video port.\n    - Digital Video Interface (DVI): Supports both analogue and digital video signals.\n    - HDMI: High -definition multimedia interface for video and audio.\n    - DisplayPort: Popular for high -resolution displays.\n  - **Ethernet ports** - allow for wired network connections, typically used for stable and fast internet or network connectivity.\n  - **Audio ports \u2013** provide connections for audio input/output devices like headphones, microphones and speakers. Common audio ports include:\n    - **3.5 mm Connector:** Used for headphones, microphones, and speakers.\n    - **S/PDIF / TOSLINK:** For digital audio transmission.\n    - **RCA Connector:** Commonly used for stereo audio and video connections.\n\n\n```\n\n### Page 14\n```markdown\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\n- **Level 1:** The smallest and fastest cache which is located inside the CPU.\n- **Level 2:** Larger than level 1 but slower. It ser ves as bridge between level 1 and level 3 or main memory (RAM) . It can either be located inside the CPU or outside, depending on the architecture of the motherboard.\n- **Level 3:** Found outside the CPU. It is shared among cores, this cache is larger and slower than L1 and L2 caches, but faster than RAM. It helps improve performance when multiple cores are trying to access the same data.\n- The **fetch -decode -execute cycle** is the basic process the CPU uses to execute instructions. It involves fetching the instruction from memory, decoding it, and then executing it. Each part of the cycle is managed by a different component of the CPU. The main operations which occur during each phase of the Fetch -Decode - Execute cycle are:\n  - Fetch phase:\n    - Load the **MAR** with the address of the next instruction to be executed.\n    - Check if the instruction is in the **cache memory**. If it is, fetch it directly from the cache.\n    - If the instruction is not in the cache, fetch it from main memory into the **MDR**, then transfer it to the **CIR**. Store the fetched instruction in the **cache** .\n- Increment the **PC** to point to the address of the next instruction.\n  - Decode phase:\n    - The **CU** translates the instruction in the **CIR**.\n    - The **CU** determines the required operations and selects the necessary machine resources. Check the **cache** for any required data. If the data is not in the **cache**, fetch it from main memory into the **MDR** .\n  - Execute phase:\n\n\n```\n\n### Page 15\n```markdown\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n- The instruction is executed, which may involve mathematical or logical operations in the **ALU**, memory access, or I/O operations.\n- Use the **ACC** to store intermediate results. The **MDR** may be used to transfer data between the **CPU** and memory.\n\n#### Factors that affect CPU performance\n\n- : \u2022 Clock speed : is the frequency with which the CPU can execute instructions , one clock tick per second would be measured as 1 Hz . The clock speed is commonly measured in gigahertz (GHz) which means that if there is a clock speed of 3 GHz it can execute 3 billion instructions per second.\n- Number of cores: A core is an independent processing unit within a CPU. Modern CPUs can have multiple cores, allowing them to perform multiple tasks **simultaneously:**\n- Dual -core will have 2 cores\n- Quad -core will have 4 cores\n- Hexa -core will have 6 cores\n- Deca -core will have 10 cores\n- it is also possible to get 12, 16, 24 and 64 cores within a CPU\n- Cache size: Larger cache sizes reduce the average memory access time; more frequently accessed data is stored closer to the CPU cores. This allows for faster execution of instructions since the CPU spends less time waiting for data to be fetched from slower main memory.\n- Parallel processing : More cores enable better multitasking and can significantly improve performance in applications designed for parallel processing.\n- Threading : is how the processor handles and executes multiple sequences of instructions (called **threads**) simultaneously. Each thread represents a single sequence of operations that the CPU can execute independently.\n- Single threading can only execute one thread at a time.\n\n\n```\n\n### Page 16\n```markdown\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n\u2022 Multilevel threading allows a single CPU core to manage more than one thread at a time, which improves performance in multi tasking and parallel processing.\n\n#### **RAM**\n\n- **Temporary Storage**: RAM holds data that the computer's processor needs right now or in the near future. When you turn off your computer, all data in RAM is lost.\n- **Speed**: RAM is much faster than other types of storage like hard drives or SSDs. This speed helps your computer run smoothly and quickly.\n- **Volatile Memory**: This means that RAM needs power to keep the data. Once the power is off, the data is gone.\n- **Capacity**: The amount of RAM in a computer can affect its performance. More RAM allows a computer to handle more tasks at once without slowing down. RAM can range from gigabytes to terabytes.\n- **Types** of RAM:\n- **DRAM (Dynamic RAM)**: This is the most common type of RAM used in computers.\n- **SRAM (Static RAM)**: Faster and more expensive than DRAM, used in smaller amounts for cache memory.\n\n#### **Buses**\n\n- **Data Bus:** Carries the actual data being processed. For example, when you open a file, the data bus transfers the file's data from the hard drive to the RAM.\n- **Address Bus:** Carries information about where the data should go. It tells the computer where to find or store data in memory.\n- **Control Bus:** Carries control signals that manage the operations of the computer. These signals ensure that all parts of the computer work together smoothly.\n\n\n```\n\n### Page 19\n```markdown\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  | <ul><li>3D Chip Architecture: 3D chip architecture stacks layers of chips vertically, allowing more components in less space.
