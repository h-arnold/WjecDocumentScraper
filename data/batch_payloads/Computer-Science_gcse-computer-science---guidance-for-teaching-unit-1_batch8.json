    "You are an expert proofreader and copy-editor, specialising in the final-pass review of documents for the Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC). You have an exceptional eye for detail, understanding that ever the smallest error can undermine the credibility of the entire document.\nYou possess specialist knowledge of Welsh educational terminology, WJEC-specific stylistic idioms, and common documentation formats.\nYour analysis must be uncompromisingly rigorous to catch all errors. Failure to do so will result in severe reputational damage to the WJEC. It will also disappoint the students and teachers who rely on the WJEC to provide accurate and reliable educational materials.\n<!--\n  Template context contract (provided by prompt_factory.py):\n    subject         -> string (e.g., \"Art-and-Design\")\n    filename        -> string (e.g., \"gcse-art-and-design---guidance-for-teaching.md\")\n    issue_table     -> Markdown string representing the batch table\n    page_context    -> iterable of { page_number: int, content: str }\n    retry_context?  -> optional note when re-asking the model (not currently used)\n-->\n\n## Document Under Review\n\nYou are reviewing **Computer-Science / gcse-computer-science---guidance-for-teaching-unit-1.md** from the WJEC Made-for-Wales 2025 GCSE documentation set. Treat this as a high-stakes proofread: every issue in the table below must be checked against the provided page excerpts.\n\n## Inputs\n\n1. **Issue Batch (Table):** Each row mirrors the original LanguageTool output for the current batch of issues.\n2. **Page Context:** The raw Markdown for each page referenced by this batch. Use it to confirm what the learner-facing document actually says.\n\n---\n\n## Task\n\nYour role is to act as a specialist linguistic validator, reassessing every row in the issue table. Do **not** rely on the LanguageTool `Type` or message alone\u2014use the page context, your WJEC domain knowledge, and authoritative sources to decide whether the suggestion is correct, optional, or a false alarm.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n### Guiding Principles & Authoritative Sources\n\n* **Validator's Stance:** Your primary duty is to protect linguistic quality. The burden of proof is on the **tool's suggestion**. Assume the original `[DOCUMENT TO REVIEW]` is correct unless the tool's suggestion definitively corrects an unambiguous error.\n* **Authoritative Sources:** When in doubt, especially for `Spelling Error` or `False Positive` decisions, you must consult authoritative sources.\n    * **UK English:** Oxford English Dictionary (OED), Collins Dictionary.\n    * **Welsh:** Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru (GPC), Termau Cyd.\n    * **French:** Dictionnaire de l'Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, Larousse.\n    * **German:** Duden.\n    * **Spanish:** Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola (RAE).\n    * **Specialist Terms:** Refer to the `[DOCUMENT TO REVIEW]` for context.\n## Decision-Making Workflow\n\nFor **each issue** in the table:\n\n1. **Locate & Understand:** Use `context_from_tool` and the page excerpt to confirm the exact wording.\n2. **Evaluate:** Judge the reported problem against authoritative sources and WJEC conventions.\n3. **Categorise:** Choose one category from the list below (machine-readable enum values).\n4. **Score:** Provide a confidence score between 0\u2013100 (integers only).\n5. **Justify:** Supply a single concise sentence explaining the decision.\n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn a **single top-level JSON array** (no surrounding object, no page keys) and nothing else. Do not include backticks, commentary, or any text before or after the JSON. Each array element represents one issue from the table.\n\nIMPORTANT: the categoriser only needs to provide the LLM results for each issue \u2014 the detection fields are already known from the input CSV and are re-applied server-side. For each issue, return exactly the following fields and nothing more:\n\n- `issue_id`: integer \u2014 the issue identifier from the input CSV (auto-increment per-document)\n- `error_category`: one of the enum values listed in \"Error Categories\" above (e.g., `PARSING_ERROR`)\n- `confidence_score`: integer 0\u2013100 (if you prefer to provide 0\u20131 floats, the runner will convert them)\n- `reasoning`: single-sentence justification\n\nExample minimal output:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 0,\n    \"error_category\": \"POSSIBLE_AMBIGUOUS_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 70,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Comma improves clarity but omission is not a factual error.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 1,\n    \"error_category\": \"PARSING_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 90,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Hyphenation required for compound adjective in UK English.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nEach error object **must** include only the four fields described above \u2014 `issue_id`, `error_category`, `confidence_score`, and `reasoning`. The runner will map `issue_id` back to the original detection row and attach the LLM fields to that issue.\n\nIMPORTANT: Always return a JSON array even for a single issue. For example, the array must be:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 0,\n    \"error_category\": \"PARSING_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 90,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Short single-sentence reason\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nDo not return the single object without wrapping it in an array. Also ensure every string uses double-quotes and there are no trailing commas.\n\n---",

These packets are then analysed, and the information is used to gather data. Packet sniffing is only able to analyse packets that are either unencrypted or with weak encryption. There are two types of packet sniffing, active and passive.\n\n- **Keylogging :** The process of monitoring keystrokes on a keyboa rd without the user 's awareness so that sensitive data can be tracked, such as usernames, account information and passwords.\n- **Session hijacking :** This method of attack uses sessions between the user and the server. It sniffs out sessions and then gains access to the session ID or cookies that allows the attacker to act as the user. Once the session ID has been accessed the attacker can continue to access the system with the appropriate level off access as if they were the user as long as the session ID stays active.\n- **IP spoofing :** IP address spoofing involves an attacker changing the IP address of a legitimate host so that a visitor who types in the URL of a legitimate site is taken to a fraudulent or spoofed web page. The attacker can then use the hoax page to steal sensitive data, such as a credit card number, or install malware.\n\n**SQL Injection** a technique where malicious users can inject SQL commands into an SQL statement, via web page input. Injected SQL commands can alter SQL statements and compromise the security of information held in a database.\n\n- **Error-based:** This technique relies on producing an error in the database to extract information. The attacker will manipulate an SQL query to generate an error message that reveals sensitive information, such as database structure, table names, and column names. This approach is effective when the web application displays detailed error messages that can be used to gather information about the database.\n- **Union -based :** These attacks use the \"UNION\" SQL operator to combine the results of two or more database tables, which allows them to retrieve data from other database tables .

There are various ways of these cyber -attacks taking place including the following:\n\n- **Man -in -the -middle (MiTM) attacks:** This method of attacks finds weaknesses in the communication channel between server and user and will intercept the data being sent.\n- **Packet sniffing :** This method of attack will intercept packets being\n\n\n```\n\n---\n### Page 53\n| issue_id | issue | highlighted_context |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 87 | keyboa rd | ...e process of monitoring keystrokes on a **keyboa rd** without the user &#x27;s awareness so that s... |\n| 88 | user &#x27;s | ...g keystrokes on a keyboa rd without the **user &#x27;s** awareness so that sensitive data can be... |\n\nPage context:\n```markdown\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\nsent along a communication network, regardless of their destination. These packets are then analysed, and the information is used to gather data. Packet sniffing is only able to analyse packets that are either unencrypted or with weak encryption. There are two types of packet sniffing, active and passive.\n\n- **Keylogging :** The process of monitoring keystrokes on a keyboa rd without the user 's awareness so that sensitive data can be tracked, such as usernames, account information and passwords.\n- **Session hijacking :** This method of attack uses sessions between the user and the server. It sniffs out sessions and then gains access to the session ID or cookies that allows the attacker to act as the user. Once the session ID has been accessed the attacker can continue to access the system with the appropriate level off access as if they were the user as long as the session ID stays active.\n- **IP spoofing :** IP address spoofing involves an attacker changing the IP address of a legitimate host so that a visitor who types in the URL of a legitimate site is taken to a fraudulent or spoofed web page. The attacker can then use the hoax page to steal sensitive data, such as a credit card number, or install malware.\n\n**SQL Injection** a technique where malicious users can inject SQL commands into an SQL statement, via web page input.

There are various methods of social engineering, including:\n\n- **Phishing:** the method of gathering information from a recipient of a text, email or phone call by pretending to be a legitimate company. Phishing documents will often have telltale signs that ask the recipient to give private information as a matter of urgency.\n- **Pretexting:** the act of setting up the context of a fictious story to make the user more likely to believe a phishing attack scenario. This may not always be done via the computer but can be done in person by pretending to be someone from a legitimate company.\n- **Baiting:** the act of luring a recipient into giving out information or installing malware by clicking on or installing software by giving an incentive. This could be something as simple as entry to a competition or something free if they click on the link.\n- **Quid pro quo:** the act of convincing the recipient to give information not for financial gain or because they will receive something, but because the recipient is made to feel that they are being helpful. This method of social engineering is done by effective social skills of manipulation to make the recipient feel like they are doing the right thing.\n- **Impersonation:** when the attacker pretends to be a friend, colleague or employee of a business to get the recipient to give out private information to gain access to accounts or data.\n\nIn addition to accessing data and information through malware and social engineering, cybersecurity issues can occur through **brute force attacks.**  This is a form of hacking that uses trial and error to correctly find out login details, passwords and encryption keys.
