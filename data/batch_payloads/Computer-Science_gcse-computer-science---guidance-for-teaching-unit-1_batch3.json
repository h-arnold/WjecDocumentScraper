    "You are an expert proofreader and copy-editor, specialising in the final-pass review of documents for the Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC). You have an exceptional eye for detail, understanding that ever the smallest error can undermine the credibility of the entire document.\nYou possess specialist knowledge of Welsh educational terminology, WJEC-specific stylistic idioms, and common documentation formats.\nYour analysis must be uncompromisingly rigorous to catch all errors. Failure to do so will result in severe reputational damage to the WJEC. It will also disappoint the students and teachers who rely on the WJEC to provide accurate and reliable educational materials.\n<!--\n  Template context contract (provided by prompt_factory.py):\n    subject         -> string (e.g., \"Art-and-Design\")\n    filename        -> string (e.g., \"gcse-art-and-design---guidance-for-teaching.md\")\n    issue_table     -> Markdown string representing the batch table\n    page_context    -> iterable of { page_number: int, content: str }\n    retry_context?  -> optional note when re-asking the model (not currently used)\n-->\n\n## Document Under Review\n\nYou are reviewing **Computer-Science / gcse-computer-science---guidance-for-teaching-unit-1.md** from the WJEC Made-for-Wales 2025 GCSE documentation set. Treat this as a high-stakes proofread: every issue in the table below must be checked against the provided page excerpts.\n\n## Inputs\n\n1. **Issue Batch (Table):** Each row mirrors the original LanguageTool output for the current batch of issues.\n2. **Page Context:** The raw Markdown for each page referenced by this batch. Use it to confirm what the learner-facing document actually says.\n\n---\n\n## Task\n\nYour role is to act as a specialist linguistic validator, reassessing every row in the issue table. Do **not** rely on the LanguageTool `Type` or message alone\u2014use the page context, your WJEC domain knowledge, and authoritative sources to decide whether the suggestion is correct, optional, or a false alarm.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n### Guiding Principles & Authoritative Sources\n\n* **Validator's Stance:** Your primary duty is to protect linguistic quality. The burden of proof is on the **tool's suggestion**. Assume the original `[DOCUMENT TO REVIEW]` is correct unless the tool's suggestion definitively corrects an unambiguous error.\n* **Authoritative Sources:** When in doubt, especially for `Spelling Error` or `False Positive` decisions, you must consult authoritative sources.\n    * **UK English:** Oxford English Dictionary (OED), Collins Dictionary.\n    * **Welsh:** Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru (GPC), Termau Cyd.\n    * **French:** Dictionnaire de l'Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, Larousse.\n    * **German:** Duden.\n    * **Spanish:** Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola (RAE).\n    * **Specialist Terms:** Refer to the `[DOCUMENT TO REVIEW]` for context.\n## Decision-Making Workflow\n\nFor **each issue** in the table:\n\n1. **Locate & Understand:** Use `context_from_tool` and the page excerpt to confirm the exact wording.\n2. **Evaluate:** Judge the reported problem against authoritative sources and WJEC conventions.\n3. **Categorise:** Choose one category from the list below (machine-readable enum values).\n4. **Score:** Provide a confidence score between 0\u2013100 (integers only).\n5. **Justify:** Supply a single concise sentence explaining the decision.\n\n\n## Output Format\n\nReturn a **single top-level JSON array** (no surrounding object, no page keys) and nothing else. Do not include backticks, commentary, or any text before or after the JSON. Each array element represents one issue from the table.\n\nIMPORTANT: the categoriser only needs to provide the LLM results for each issue \u2014 the detection fields are already known from the input CSV and are re-applied server-side. For each issue, return exactly the following fields and nothing more:\n\n- `issue_id`: integer \u2014 the issue identifier from the input CSV (auto-increment per-document)\n- `error_category`: one of the enum values listed in \"Error Categories\" above (e.g., `PARSING_ERROR`)\n- `confidence_score`: integer 0\u2013100 (if you prefer to provide 0\u20131 floats, the runner will convert them)\n- `reasoning`: single-sentence justification\n\nExample minimal output:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 0,\n    \"error_category\": \"POSSIBLE_AMBIGUOUS_GRAMMATICAL_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 70,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Comma improves clarity but omission is not a factual error.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 1,\n    \"error_category\": \"PARSING_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 90,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Hyphenation required for compound adjective in UK English.\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nEach error object **must** include only the four fields described above \u2014 `issue_id`, `error_category`, `confidence_score`, and `reasoning`. The runner will map `issue_id` back to the original detection row and attach the LLM fields to that issue.\n\nIMPORTANT: Always return a JSON array even for a single issue. For example, the array must be:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"issue_id\": 0,\n    \"error_category\": \"PARSING_ERROR\",\n    \"confidence_score\": 90,\n    \"reasoning\": \"Short single-sentence reason\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nDo not return the single object without wrapping it in an array. Also ensure every string uses double-quotes and there are no trailing commas.\n\n---",

Pages appear in ascending order and always include the page marker line.\n\n### Page 29\n```markdown\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n- 0 + 0 = 0\n- 0 + 1 = 1\n- 1 + 0 = 1\n- 1 + 1 = 10 (which is 0 with a carry of 1)\n- 1 + 1 + 1 = 11 (which is 1 with a carry of 1)\n- If there is a carry, add it to the next column.\n\n#### *Example:*\n\n01101011\n\n10001011 +\n\n**11110110**\n\n1 11 carry\n\n#### **Digital Storage of Graphics**\n\n#### **Vector graphics are stored using mathematics**\n\n- A vector uses mathematical representations of geometrically primitive objects (lines, curves etc.) to represent images.\n- Vector graphics can be scaled up without loss of apparent quality.\n- They are smaller than bitmap graphics in terms of the memory required to store them.\n- Vectors can be edited easily and are used for graphical designs such as, logos and icons.\n\n#### **Raster graphics are stored in pixels:**\n\n- Each pixel has a colour value that is stored as a binary value.\n- Each image will have a bit depth, which impacts on the size and quality of the image.\n- The greater the bit depth the more colour information, detail and greater quality, but also a larger file size.\n\n#### **Resolution**\n\n- This refers to the number of pixels in an image, represented by width and height.\n- The higher the resolution the greater the quality and detail of the images.\n\n\n```\n\n### Page 30\n```markdown\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\n\u2022 The higher the resolution the higher the file size.\n\n#### **Bit Depth**\n\n- The number of bits used to represent the colour of **each pixel** in an image.\n- It specifies how many bits are used to store information about a pixel's colour.\n- An 8-bit bit depth means that 8 bits will be allocated **per pixel**. Allowing for 256 different combinations.\n- The higher the bit depth, the larger the file size and increased quality.\n\n#### **Colour Depth:**\n\n- The number of colours that an image can represent affected by the bit depth.\n- Higher values allow for more colours to be represented.\n- When referred to, this will be as \"bits per channel\" (bpc).\n- Example: 8-bit colour depth for \"RGB\" would be:\n  - 8-bits for **R**, 8-bits for **G** and 8-bits for **B**.\n\nNote: Historical lower-depth systems mainly used bits per pixel (bpp). This specification uses modern conventions of bits per component (also known as bits per channel) (bpc)\n\n#### **Colour Model:**\n\n- A mathematical model describing the way that colours can be represented as tuples of numbers.\n- These are typically three or four values or colour components (e.g., RGB, CMYK)\n\n#### **Calculating Image Storage Requirements**\n\nTo calculate the storage requirement for an image, you need to know:\n\n- 1. Resolution: The width and height of the image in pixels.\n- 2. Colour Depth: The number of bits used per channel.\n- 3. Bit Depth: The number of bits used per pixel.\n\n\n```\n\n### Page 31\n```markdown\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n#### **Formula for calculation:**\n\nStorage Size = (Width \u00d7 Height \u00d7 Bits Per Pixel)\n\n#### **Determine the Total Number of Pixels:**\n\n- Multiply the width by the height of the image.\n- Example: For an image with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels:\n\n$$Total\\ Pixels = 1920 \\times 1080 = 2,073,600\\ pixels$$\n\n#### **Calculate Bits Per Pixel (bpp):**\n\n- Multiply the bit depth by the number of channels.\n- Example: For an 8-bit RGB image:\n\n$$Bits \\ Per \\ Pixel = 8 \\ (bits - Red) + 8 \\ (bits - Green) + 8 \\ (bits - Blue)$$\n  \n= 24 bits\n\n### **Calculate Total bits:**\n\n- Multiply the total number of pixels by the bits per pixel.\n- Example:\n\n$$\\textit{Total bits} = 2,073,600 \\ \\textit{pixels} \\times 24 \\ \\textit{bits} = 49,766,400 \\ \\textit{bits}$$\n\n#### **Convert bits to bytes:**\n\n- Divide the total bits by 8 (1 byte = 8 bits).\n- Example:\n\n$$Total\\ bytes = \\frac{49,766,400\\ bits}{8} = 6,220,800\\ bytes$$\n\n#### **Convert bytes to kilobytes (KB):**\n\n\u2022 Divide the total bytes by 1024 (since 1 KB = 1024 bytes).\n\n\n```\n\n\n---"
